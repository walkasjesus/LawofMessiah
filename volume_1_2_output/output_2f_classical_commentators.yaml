    consulted, all translate gid hanasheh as "the sinew of the thigh
    vein." Meir says that there are two sinews - an inner one that is near the
    hip socket, and another that is further away. He says that the inner one is
    the subject of the Torah prohibition, and the other cannot be eaten
    either as a result of rulings of the Sages. Of the three, HaChinuch is the
    only one who attempts to explain the underlying reason for the mitzvah , but draws conclusions that both exceed and contradict the
    biblical text. He says, for example, that the man who wrestled with Jacob
    was Esau''s (not Jacob''s) guardian angel, and he was attempting to extirpate
    Jacob and his progeny from the world. When he did not succeed, he caused
    Jacob pain by dislocating his hip. HaChinuch says that this is predictive of
    Esau and his descendants (the
    Arabs) 3 seeking to eradicate and inflict pain upon the Children of Israel, that they
    will not succeed, and that when the Messiah comes, Israel will be healed. 3. Esau, the elder son of Isaac, married his cousin

  classical_commentators: 'There are some differences among Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch regarding
    one''s obligation to unload and reload an animal that belongs to a Jew and
    that has fallen as a result of its burden. All agree that both unloading and
    reloading are obligations but in regard to unloading, Meir states that an
    elder is exempt because it is beneath the dignity of his status as an elder.
    HaChinuch agrees with the elder exemption in general, but states that the
    elder is not exempt if he would have unloaded his own animal under similar
    circumstances. HaChinuch also states (but Meir does not) that if one
    encounters a friend and a non-friend with a fallen animal at precisely the
    same time, one must first assist the non-friend in unloading in order to
    avoid impure intent. Strangely, in regard to the loading of a fallen animal,
    Meir and HaChinuch state these obligations somewhat in reverse. Meir states
    that an elder is exempt from loading and reloading unless he would have done
    similarly for himself, and he states that one must help a non-friend before a
    friend. HaChinuch, on the other hand, makes no mention of friends,
    non-friends, and elders being exempt in the case of loading, whereas
    Maimonides does not allude to these secondary matters at all. Of significance is that, in the New Covenant Scriptures, Matthew 23:11 and 20:26-27 , Yeshua speaks against Meir''s and HaChinuch''s
    interpretation that the dignity of an elder causes him to be exempt from
    helping his neighbor with the neighbor''s fallen animal. In fact, Yeshua
    teaches the opposite when He says: " The greatest among you must be your servant " and " Whoever among you wants to be a leader must become your servant, and
    whoever wants to be first must be your slave! "'

    parents into a single mitzvah . Instead, they wrote separate mitzvot for each, the combined essence of which agrees entirely with

    19:3 ) 5 .
    Maimonides adds that we are required to care for our parents when they become
    old; Meir agrees and goes into some detail of our obligation to financially
    support our parents when necessary. He further says that we are to attend
    our father as a servant would attend his master, but we are not to sin in
    following our parents'' instructions. In regard to revering our parents, all three commentators link reverence to
    fear, and instruct against standing or sitting in one''s father''s place. Meir says that we are not to contradict our father''s words or refer to him by his
    name. HaChinuch is detailed in other ways, and raises the question of how
    far reverence of parents should go. He indicates that we must be able to
    suffer indignities and wrongs done to us without putting our parents to
    shame, and we must be respectful of them even if their minds become deranged
    in connection with their age. Of course, we are not to curse them or strike

    of the creation of the world as well as the miracle of Israel''s exodus from
    Egypt. HaChinuch and Meir state that the sages list 39 activities that are
    prohibited on the Sabbath ( Shab. 73a ); these are intended as a fence
    around the Torah . Of the three commentators, Meir is the only one who
    states that it is forbidden for a Jew to ask a Gentile to do work in his
    behalf on the Sabbath, and he also states that doing work on the Sabbath is
    permitted if it is to save a human life. None of the traditional mitzvot addresses the requirement of Leviticus 23:3 that the
    Sabbath should be a day of "holy convocation". Special mention is made of Maimonides'' RN322 and HaChinuch''s C114, in which
    they profess that we must not inflict punishment on Shabbat. The Scripture
    upon which they rely is Exodus 35:3 , which states: You are not to kindle a fire in any of your homes on Shabbat. The logic of relying on this seemingly inapplicable Scripture is that one of
    the ways of punishing according to the Mosaic Law is burning.'

    ourselves and suggests that, where possible, it ought to be given
    anonymously. Meir has a great deal to say about tz''dakah that is very
    motivating. For starters, he makes the statement: "We are duty-bound to be
    more careful about the mitzvah of charity than about all the other
    positive commandments" 1 .
    He goes on to say that "charity is a distinguishing characteristic of the
    descendants of Abraham" 2 , and that the "faith of truth"
    and charity are inseparably linked. Maimonides construes the commandment as
    our being responsible to give tz''dakah to humanity broadly, while Meir
    is more explicit in applying it to Jews. HaChinuch tells us that one of the
    values of giving tz''dakah anonymously us to not embarrass the
    recipient, and suggests that if a needy person is reluctant to receive it as
    a gift, he might, nevertheless, receive it as a loan. He also opines that
    even a poor man is obligated to give tz''dakah , and reminds us that
    even a normally wealthy man can fall on hard times financially due to illness
    and other causes, and may need temporary help, possibly in the way of a loan. 1. Quoted from C. Chavel, The

    night to the extent that one must not eat even one regular meal outside of

    speaks a great deal about its structure, and is much more liberal than Meir
    in how much "living" one must do in it. He states, for example, that on the
    first night of Sukkot one must eat at least an olive''s amount of
    bread in a sukkah and, after that, it is voluntary. HaChinuch also
    focuses on bread by stating that meals other than "regular meals of bread"

    saying that if we see an idol-worshipper drowning, we are not to save him,
    and if we find him ill, we are not to cure him. He does not, however,
    advocate precipitating a person''s death merely because he is an
    idol-worshipper. Maimonides treats this mitzvah in another way - as a
    prohibition against extending grace to an idolater. He says, for example,
    that we must not complement an idolater as being good-looking. A strange
    example, but it makes the point. Note: Leviticus 19:16 that is cited by Maimonides'' RN19, and Exodus

    community, but going to hear them being blown is the responsibility of each

    HaShanah . He explains that the Mishnah in Talmud tractate b. Rosh HaShanah 2a considers the 1 st of Tishrei to be the beginning of the year (for numbering the years),
    and that the blowing (or sounding) was determined, by the sages, to be of the shofar as distinguished from some other musical instrument. He also
    speaks of " t''ruah " as a broken sound, which he relates to man''s need
    of repentance from sin. HaChinuch states that any hollow animal horn may be blown on Rosh
    HaShanah , whereas Meir states that only the horn of a sheep is
    acceptable. They both state that it is obligatory to hear nine sounds of the shofar , consisting of t''kiah (a single unwavering sound), t''ruah (a series of short broken sounds), and sh''varim (several

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote nine mitzvot that
    collectively express the principle of this one Mitzvah . Most of the
    commentators'' mitzvot are self-explanatory, but there is one that
    bears special mention. In his mitzvah C27, HaChinuch criticizes
    Maimonides for making no distinction of culpability between making an idol
    with one''s own hands, and commissioning one''s agent to make an idol for him.
    HaChinuch writes that there should be such a distinction because of an
    established Talmudic rule ( TB Kidushin 42b ) that a person who
    commissions another to commit a wrong is not himself guilty of the wrong. In
    saying this, HaChinuch may be referring to Maimonides'' RN3 and not RN2 which
    is described in this Mitzvah . Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch wrote separate mitzvot for bowing down
    to an idol (Maimonides RN5; Meir MN11; HaChinuch C28), and for worshiping an
    idol (Maimonides RN6; Meir MN 12; HaChinuch C29), which seems to me to be
    splitting hairs. In their mitzvot RN14, MN13, and C86 respectively, Maimonides, Meir,
    and HaChinuch interpret Exodus 23:13 narrowly to mean that we are not
    to swear in the name of idols, and in their mitzvot RN26, MN27, and
    C518 respectively, they interpret it to mean that we are not to prophesy in
    the name of an idol. In his mitzvah RN10, Maimonides admonishes the reader to not study or
    pay attention to idolatry, whereas Meir and HaChinuch (MN16 and C213
    respectively) command the reader to not turn toward idolatry. While there
    is, indeed, the possibility that a spiritually weak person could become
    attracted to idolatry through learning about it, I do not believe that the
    Scriptures cited support such a broad restriction. Deuteronomy 12:30 is clear that the prohibition is against inquiring about foreign gods for the
    purpose of following them.'

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides analogizes loving God with meditating upon and contemplating His mitzvot ; he says that by so doing, we get to know Him and receive joy.
    Also, because the words of the Sh''ma speak of teaching God''s mitzvot , Maimonides associates the commandment to love God with our
    obligation to teach the people of the world that they must have faith in Him
    and serve Him. Meir agrees with Maimonides, and adds the component of having affection for
    God. He refers to Abraham''s relationship with God as an example of there
    being "love" between them, and he quotes Genesis 12:5 as an example of
    Abraham''s love through obedience, and Isaiah 41:8 as an example of God
    considering Abraham to be His friend (see reference to this in James
    2:23 ). HaChinuch adds an interesting perspective by stating that a man cannot fully
    obey God''s Commandments unless he loves Him. This is the reverse of (but not
    inconsistent with) the Scriptures cited above that infer that one way to love
    God is by obeying His Commandments. HaChinuch also cites God''s relationship with Abraham, and that our love of
    God should cause us to encourage others to serve and worship Him as well.'

    lightly. 2 They do, however, cite Leviticus 22:32 that warns against desecrating
    or profaning the Divine Name which, they say, is a very serious sin -
    especially if committed in public. HaChinuch echoes Maimonides on this, and
    Maimonides goes further to give some specific examples, through which it is
    clear that he agrees with the premise of this Mitzvah , that swearing
    by God''s Name falsely or engaging in sinful conduct, even without mentioning
    God''s Name, violates Leviticus 22:32 . He says that this is especially
    so if it is committed by a person of known or presumed piety. Meir refers to the sin of conspicuously profaning or desecrating the Name of
    God (including when one is coerced to change his religion) as chillul HaShem 3 ,
    and says that a man must even surrender to death rather than commit this sin.
    He says that even the power of repenting on Yom Kippur is not enough
    to atone for chillul Hashem , and therefore the sin remains with the
    offender for his entire
    life. 4 Prophesying falsely is another way that God''s name can be used wrongfully.
    Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote mitzvot (RN27, MN175, and
    C517, respectively) codifying Deuteronomy 18:20 , that says it is an
    offense punishable by death for a prophet to prophesy falsely. Maimonides
    and HaChinuch point out that the offense is not dependent upon whether the
    prophet''s statement is true, but whether God actually told the prophet to
    speak it. So, for example, if God gave a word of truth to a first prophet, a
    second prophet to which the word was not given would be in violation were he
    to invoke God''s Name in speaking the same word. All the classical
    commentators agree that the false prophet should, according to the Mosaic
    Law, be put to death by strangulation. Maimonides and HaChinuch (but not Meir) wrote related mitzvot (RN29
    and C519, respectively) that seek to interpret Deuteronomy 18:22 .
    Maimonides states that we are forbidden to take pity on a false prophet or,
    out of fear, neglect to put him to death. HaChinuch says the same, and adds
    that the fear spoken of in the Scripture is fear of our being punished for
    conducting the execution of a prophet. That notwithstanding, verse 22 alludes neither to executing false prophets, nor to our being punished for
    it; it merely says that we have nothing to fear from the false prophet. 2. Although Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch do not
    reference Exodus 20:7 in any of their mitzvot , they do warn
    against speaking God''s Name in vain in RP4, MP4, and C432 respectively
    (See Mitzvah # G6 of this compilation). 3. Public or conspicuous misbehavior that

    perpetrator''s own hand. If he only caused the death, he is not punishable by
    a bet din but only by "Heaven''s hands". Ironically, this may even be
    the case if one pays another to commit murder. Meir also opines that if one
    kills even a single Jewish person, it is as though he slew the entire world. HaChinuch begins with citing Genesis 1:28 : God blessed them: God said to them, ''Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth
    and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and every
    living creature that crawls on the earth.'' He sees murder as violating God''s plan that human beings multiply and settle

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'', Meir''s, and HaChinuch''s mitzvot that are based on Leviticus 19:32 , command that we honor persons of advanced age and Torah scholars despite the fact that the Scripture says nothing about
    scholars. Most of what they write has to do with the particulars of how we
    extend honor, and their writings on this are fairly complex and legalistic.
    To give a sense of it, here is a brief quote from Meir''s MP17 from Charles
    Wengrove''s English adaptation of " Concise Book of
    Mitzvoth ": 3 The term sevah ("a man of hoary head") means someone of very advanced age,
    even if he is not a man of wisdom. One is duty-bound to stand before him -
    even a wise scholar who is very young; but he is not obligated to stand up to
    his full height before him [the old man], but only enough to honor him. The
    term zaken means zeh she-kanah chochmah , one who has acquired
    wisdom. Even if he is very young, one is to stand up to his full height
    before him, from the time he [the scholar] comes within four cubits until he
    has left his presence. Meir''s treatment of the subject goes on to speak of honoring to one''s Torah teacher, and concludes by saying: Whoever disgraces such scholars will have no share in the world-to-come. 3. Yisrael Meir haKohen, The Concise Book of
    Mitzvoth (The Commandments Which Can Be Observed Today), Charles

    cites the Talmudic rule that allows an "expert scholar" or three
    "ordinary persons" to release a "man" from a vow that he has made and
    subsequently regrets. HaChinuch cites the Talmudic rule but states that, according to
    Maimonides, it should not be listed among the compilation of mitzvot .

    we swear an oath by any created object in the belief that it has, in itself,
    sufficient truth to support the oath, we have put that created object on an
    equal footing with the Creator, which is sin. There is no mitzvah written on the subject by Meir.'

    one flesh with one''s wife when one marries. Maimonides'' RP213, Meir''s MP44,
    and HaChinuch''s C552, rely on Deuteronomy 24:1 to support their
    allegation that marriage must be by kiddushin (consecration) - a
    binding marriage ceremony. The Scripture does not say that, nor does any
    other Scripture. Maimonides and HaChinuch refer to Exodus 21:11 , and Meir refers to Deuteronomy 24:1 to support their general law of marriage, but I find
    all three commentators ambiguous as to whether their respective mitzvot command marriage or simply describe the kiddushin (sanctification), of a marriage ceremony. Apparently, Rabbi Dr. Charles B.
    Chavel, a prominent translator into English of Maimonides'' " Sefer
    HaMitzvot " had the same concern, for he found it necessary to introduce
    the bracketed word [only] in the first sentence of his mitzvah RP213,
    causing it to read: By this injunction we are commanded to take a woman to wife [only] by a
    binding ceremony: either by giving her something [of
    value] 2 ,
    or by handing her a writ of marriage, or by intercourse [accompanied by a
    declaration of marriage]. Meir discusses kiddushin through the payment of monetary value, and he
    also discusses betrothal before nissuin (consummation) but not the
    other ways of consecrating a marriage. HaChinuch presents the most detail of kiddushin . He states that if
    marriage is consecrated by the giving of monetary value, the groom must say:
    "You are now consecrated to me by this money (or thing of monetary value)."
    If the marriage is consecrated by a document, the groom must say: "You are
    consecrated to me by this document (or whatever it is)." If marriage is
    consecrated by sexual intercourse, he must say to his bride before witnesses:
    "You are consecrated to me by this act of intimacy." He then takes his bride
    into seclusion and is seen doing so by the witnesses. 2. The modern equivalent of paying the bride money is for
    the groom to give the bride a wedding ring of significant monetary value
    while stating: "You are hereby consecrated to me with this ring, according
    to the law of Moses and Israel." It is analogous to a "bride price"
    practiced in certain other cultures, and opposite to a "dowry" which the
    bride or the bride''s father is expected to pay to the groom.'

    the Scriptures in a way that is difficult with regard to resting the land,

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'' and HaChinuch''s mitzvot , RP222 and C579,
    respectively, state that a divorce can only be acquired through the issuance
    of a writ ( get ), and Meir did not write a corresponding mitzvah on the subject. All three commentators wrote mitzvot acknowledging
    that Scripture prohibits a man from remarrying his divorced wife if she has
    remarried in the interim, and all three prohibit a man from divorcing his
    wife if he subjected her to false accusations that besmirched her character,
    or acquired his wife after stealing her virginity. They also state that a
    divorce can only be acquired through the issuance of a writ ( get ).
    They did not discuss or write mitzvot about the marriage covenant per
    se. Addendum by Daniel C. Juster Two Evangelical scholars, William Luck (formally a professor at Moody Bible
    Institute) and David Instone-Brewer, have sought to broaden the biblical
    grounds for divorce through books each has written. Luck''s treatment of
    divorce expands the meaning of abandoning marriage (re: 1 Corinthians
    7 ) to the idea of the spouse - especially the man - not fulfilling the
    biblical requirements for basic covenant. Instone-Brewer references
    Luck''s work and expands on it with his vast Talmudic knowledge.
    Luck''s basic idea is that Yeshua''s exception clause is basically a
    rejection of the "any-cause" divorce idea, and a reaffirmation of the primary
    reason for divorce, which is marital unfaithfulness. Instone-Brewer, on the
    other hand, seeks to show, through much "Second Temple Judaism" scholarship,
    that unfaithfulness does not only mean adultery, but should be interpreted in
    terms of four requirements for marriage which first apply to the husband but,
    by extension, also partially apply to the wife. According to the texts of
    the Torah , the husband is to bring faithfulness to the marriage to not
    commit adultery (fornicate with another), to give the wife her conjugal
    rights, to provide sustenance (food and shelter), and lastly to not
    physically abuse her. Just as a slave goes free who is beaten to the extent
    of bodily injury, so is physical abuse of a spouse grounds for divorce.
    Failure to provide any of these four "requirements of marriage" amounts to
    basic unfaithfulness. Strangely, after making a strong case for the fourfold meaning of
    unfaithfulness and grounding it in first century Judaism and more, Brewer
    misses a central point of Dr. Rudolph''s scholarship in this Mitzvah , which is the requirement that a get (writ of divorce)
    must be issued by a legitimate court of elders that has the authority over
    the subject matter and the parties. The depth of Instone-Brewer''s
    Jewish scholarship is very good, so it is astonishing that he misses this,
    and can see believers acting in accordance with their individual consciences
    in determining when the lines of fidelity have been sufficiently crossed, so
    as to allow them a secular divorce. Rather, the biblical teaching is that no
    such divorce (with the allowance of remarriage) can be validated without a
    written get . Matthew 16 and Matthew 18 provide for this
    authority to be vested in the leadership of Yeshua''s Kehillah . Regarding the fourfold meaning of unfaithfulness and its connection to 1
    Corinthians 7 , my evaluation of Instone-Brewer is that he makes a
    convincing case, but that it is not fully proven. While I am loathe to open
    up greater grounds for divorce in our era of easy divorces and remarriages, I
    think courts of elders should study evidence that is presented by a
    complainant seeking to divorce, and decide whether to issue a get based upon what they conclude are biblical grounds. Also, the more equal way
    to judge divorce cases, is to consider that either the husband or the wife
    can breach the marriage covenant.'

  classical_commentators: 'A number of the classical mitzvot aspire to control how we speak so as
    not to harm others, but the one closest to this Mitzvah is Maimonides''
    negative mitzvah RN301 (corresponding to MN77 and C236), that is based
    on Leviticus 19:16 , and which forbids us from bearing tales among our
    people. Maimonides'' mitzvah RN301 also prohibits "defaming", which
    some rabbis and commentators believe means defaming the reputation of a bride
    (see RP219). Meir and HaChinuch have much more than Maimonides to say about Leviticus
    19:16 and its relationship to lashon hara . First of all, they
    interpret the Scripture narrowly as meaning that a person must not tell
    another person that a third person has spoken negatively about him. Meir
    adds that gossiping with evil intent is criminally worse than merely
    tale-bearing, and that it has the effect of killing three people - the
    gossiper, the person who receives the gossip, and the person who is gossiped
    about. Neither Meir nor HaChinuch make mention of defaming a bride. Meir speaks of punishment for violating Leviticus 19:16 that will come
    from HaShem , but HaChinuch is more temporally severe, and speaks of it
    being our religious duty to end the life of person who threatens to inform on
    another, and under certain other circumstances as well. If such executions
    were ever authorized under the Mosaic Law, they were most certainly part of
    the Sinai Covenant''s judicial processes. Under no circumstances are they
    authorized in the New Covenant under which we live today. One may wonder why this Mitzvah lists Leviticus 19:17 , a
    Scripture that speaks of rebuking our neighbor, but that does mention anyone
    being wronged or harmed. It is because Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch
    interpret and quote that Scripture as the basis for their respective mitzvot RN303, MN77 and C240, which admonish us to not shame our
    neighbor by rebuking him in public. Another wrongful use of speech, recognized by the commentators, is cursing.
    Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch constructed mitzvot that prohibit the
    cursing of parents, judges, and Israelites, and Maimonides and HaChinuch each
    wrote a mitzvah that prohibits the cursing of a ruler. Strangely,
    none of them mention cursing God, that is specifically prohibited by Exodus 22:27(28) , which all three quote to support their mitzvot . Leviticus 19:33 is listed because it is referenced by Maimonides and
    HaChinuch in their RN252 and C63 (respectively), both of which assume that
    the wrong alluded to in the Scripture is wrongful speech.'

    also says that we are prohibited from eating matzah the day before
    Passover, so that our appetite for it will be increased. Maimonides and
    HaChinuch do not mention eating maror , but refer their readers to
    the Talmud''s tractate Pesachim for other provisions of the mitzvah . Maimonides and HaChinuch state that it is the evening of the
    15 th day of Nisan when we are to eat

  classical_commentators: 'None of the commentators (Maimonides, Meir, or HaChinuch) wrote general mitzvot commanding that we be thankful to God. That is no doubt
    because they only sought to codify commandments they found in the Torah , and concluded that Deuteronomy 8:10 is the only
    Scripture in the Torah that commands thankfulness. Two English translations for Deuteronomy 8:10 are included in the
    Scripture list above. None of the commentators worked in the English
    language, of course, but the way the New King James Version translates Deuteronomy 8:10 must have been close to how all three of them
    understood the Hebrew. I conclude this because all three of their mitzvot command that we bless God after we have eaten a meal (i.e. say
    Grace). Although the context of the Scripture is the Israelites having come
    into the Promised Land, Maimonides, Meir, HaChinuch and all of Judaism
    interpret it broadly to mean that, after we have eaten and are satisfied, we
    are to remember God who brought us out of Egypt. That is the purpose of the Birkat Hamazon . Meir states that we are also to bless God before
    eating. Using the logic of kal va-chomer (less to more), he states
    that if we are to bless God when we are satisfied, how much more is our
    obligation to bless him when we are hungry. The logic seems a little
    backwards, but that is his logic. As with thanking God, none of the commentators wrote mitzvot on
    "blessing God" either.'

    differently, they essentially agree that prayer is linked to service. Because
    they cannot find anything in the Torah explicitly commanding prayer,
    they treat praying to God and rendering service to God as being essentially
    the same and only quote Scriptures that command service. The only reference to worship is found in the caption of Maimonides''
    Commandment #RP5, as translated by Charles B. Chavel in his two volume work,
    "The
    Commandments." 1 Meir captions his Commandment #MP7 as "Praying Every Day to God," and
    HaChinuch captions his Commandment #C433 as "The Precept of Prayer to the
    Almighty." Despite Chavel''s caption, Maimonides does not discuss worshiping
    God at all, but rather exhorts us only to serving Him and to prayer. Of the three, Meir is the only one of the commentators that connects praising
    God to prayer and service. He states that the commandment requires a
    sequence in addressing God: (1) praising Him; (2) petitioning Him; and (3)
    both praising and thanking Him. He also says that, in praying to God, it is
    necessary to do so with "focused intention of the heart." This is known as
    praying with kavanah . HaChinuch begins his mitzvah #C433 by referring to the Scriptures
    commanding that we give service to God, and then quotes Maimonides: Now, R. Moses b. Maimon of blessed memory wrote: Although this mitzvah is one of the all-inclusive precepts - in other words, those
    which include the entire Torah , since the service of God includes all
    the mitzvot - it likewise contains a specific detail: namely, that God
    commanded us to pray to Him ... HaChinuch then proceeds to explain our responsibility to pray three
    times a day, corresponding to the times when sacrifices were conducted in the
    Temple. He uses the term "prayer services", which links prayer with service,
    and expresses that predominant Jewish understanding that "prayer services"
    are meant to give "service" to God. As in the case of the other
    commentators, HaChinuch does not refer to worship even once. All three of the commentators, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch, rely on Talmud Bavli Ta''anith 2a as their authority for linking prayer to the
    Scriptures commanding service to God. 1. Charles B. Chavel, The Commandments ,

    circumstances alluded to in this Scripture to include anything that is
    overtly holy (including one of the seven Names of God) and anything that is
    generally useful. Meir would carry this even to the point of not melting
    down a piece of metal upon which has been written one of God''s Names.
    HaChinuch emphasizes that we must not erase any holy writing, or destroy a
    temple or altar established for the worship of God. Both he and Maimonides
    state that if Scripture is written down by an Israelite, it must not be
    erased or destroyed. If it is written by an heretical Israelite, it is not
    holy and must be destroyed (even if it contains God''s Name) because the
    heretic did not believe in the holiness of the Name when he wrote it.
    HaChinuch says that if it is written by a heathen, it should not be
    destroyed, but rather hidden and stored out of sight. Maimonides agrees with
    Meir and HaChinuch, that we must not break down houses where the Lord is
    worshiped. Regarding Deuteronomy 20:19 : All three commentators interpret this
    Scripture broadly to include destruction of all kinds. Maimonides and Meir
    first deal with the Scripture literally as prohibiting our destroying fruit
    trees in the process of setting siege to a town, and Maimonides adds: "in
    order to cause
    distress." 2 Meir goes on to say that we must not cut down any fruit tree destructively,
    nor break a useful object, nor tear a garment, nor ruin food, nor demolish a
    sound structure. HaChinuch states that we must not destroy fruit trees in
    order to cause damage or loss, nor should we needlessly set fires, tear
    clothing, or break vessels. He says that the reason for these restrictions
    is in order to fulfill the mitzvah of loving others (presumably he
    means our enemies), and to bring out the love that is inherent in godly
    people. We are to love that which is good and beneficial, be saddened when a
    valuable thing is broken or destroyed, and never destroy anything in anger. 2. See also, Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Hilchot

    HaChinuch spends a considerable proportion of his writing on our not
    blaspheming or speaking the Lord''s Name in vain. The connection that both he
    and Maimonides make to fearing God is that, doing either, results in our
    losing the kind of reverend fear of God that God requires. Maimonides and HaChinuch emphasize an expectation and fear of God''s
    punishment, whereas this Mitzvah emphasizes a reverend and loving fear
    of God, with the hope and expectation of our not sinning. Maimonides also
    speaks of not speaking God''s Name in vain. Although all three commentators state that we are not to speak God''s Name in
    vain, none of them make reference to the third of the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:7 3 .
    Also, even though it is a reality that if one sins, punishment is likely to
    follow, I do not believe it is the intended meaning of the Commandment to
    fear God. Perhaps the difference in my approach has to do with my belief
    that we are exclusively in and subject to the New Covenant. The New Covenant
    acknowledges the possibility that a believer in God and Messiah will sin, but
    it does not assume it. This is unambiguously taught in 1 John 2:1 : My children, I am writing you these things so that you won''t sin. But if
    anyone does sin, we have Yeshua the Messiah, the Tzaddik, who pleads our
    cause with the Father. 3. For a discussion of Exodus 20:7 , see Mitzvah # A6 of this compilation.'

    speaks of blood as being the kind of food eaten by a stubborn and rebellious

    humane and protective society - a society that does not reward laziness, but
    helps those in genuine need and leads to a gracious caring for one another.
    It is related to the more clearly social welfare rules to be discussed in
    other mitzvot , such as a planter providing for the poor by not
    harvesting the corners of his corn field, not double-thrashing olive trees,
    and not picking up fallen fruit from other trees. A biblically humane
    society does have a welfare component, though it may not be in redistribution

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides states that a purpose of the Sh''mittah commandment is to
    teach kindness to the poor, and he also puts forth the case that it trains us
    against coveting what our neighbor owns. The logic is that, by not being
    allowed to recover money he has lent, how much more must the lender keep from
    coveting what belongs to the borrower. HaChinuch agrees with this kal
    va-chomer logic. HaChinuch connects complying with Deuteronomy 15:9 (the requirement to
    lend even with Sh''mittah approaching) with trusting God by citing Proverbs 11:24-25 as God''s promise of blessing to those who are
    generous. The other commentators make no such connection and, in fact,
    Maimonides exhibits severity toward foreigners by interpreting the permissive
    language in Deuteronomy 15:3 (" you may demand that a foreigner pay
    his debt ") into his Mitzvah RP142 which states that we are
    required to collect debts from heathen with the same zeal as we forgive the
    debts of Israelites. Meir does not deal with the issue at all, but
    HaChinuch, in his Mitzvah C476, agrees with Maimonides, and says that
    it is so that an idolater will not profit from an Israelite''s generosity and
    possibly entice the sympathetic Israelite to follow after idolatrous
    practices. Meir is of the opinion that if a borrower offers return of a loan voluntarily
    after Sh''mittah , the lender should not accept it. However, if it is
    offered a second time, then he may.'

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'' mitzvah RP175 and Chinuch''s C78 are worthy of special
    mention because of how Maimonides and HaChinuch translate Exodus 23:2 .
    Both of their mitzvot follow TB Hullin
    112 2 in declaring that the majority should rule in a legal case when there is a
    dispute among judges. Not contrary but different, the Complete Jewish Bible
    (in basic agreement with Christian translations) states: Do not follow the crowd when it does what is wrong; and don''t allow the
    popular view to sway you into offering testimony for any cause if the effect
    will be to pervert justice. That notwithstanding, the following English translation of the Tanakh 3 supports Maimonides and HaChinuch by translating Exodus 23:2 : Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in
    a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment. Clearly, this second translation is quite opposite in that its phrase "to
    decline after many to wrest judgment" supports Maimonides'' and HaChinuch''s mitzvot RP175 and C78 respectively, whereas the CJB translation does
    not. It is important to note that even when a mitzvah of Mosaic vintage
    appears to have application today, the application may have to be adjusted.
    An example would be the mitzvah to not convict a person on the
    testimony of only one witness. The caution is still observed, but today''s
    forensic technologies (e.g. ballistic and DNA testing, photographs, voice
    recordings, etc.) allow very great certainty in connecting suspects to crimes
    without their being even a single eyewitness. A word is needed regarding Maimonides'' departure from Meir and HaChinuch
    concerning the meaning of Deuteronomy 17:11 . Meir and HaChinuch
    interpret " the place which ADONAI your God will choose " as the Sanhedrin . Maimonides, on the other hand, in his RN312, interprets the
    Scripture to mean that we are not to disagree with the authorized conveyors
    of tradition. 2. This reference is to tractate Hullin of the

    wild beasts in the field. Maimonides, Meir, and Chinuch state that we are forbidden to eat an animal
    that has died of its own accord ( n''veilah ), and Meir adds that n''veilah includes meat from an animal that was not properly

    wishes to eat, and none of the commentators allow for eating a hunted animal
    or bird - even if its blood is first poured out. This is probably one of the
    most extreme of the rabbinical fences placed around the Torah in that
    it adversely affects many in the world who must hunt in order to eat.
    Consistent with this view, the commentators interpret Leviticus 17:13 as applying to ritual slaughter when, in fact, the actual subject of the

    foreigners to be demanded during the Sh''mittah , Maimonides and
    HaChinuch interpret the Scripture as requiring that loans to idolaters
    be collected. Meir''s compilation does not reference Deuteronomy 15:3 at all, and does not promulgate any such requirement. Also, none of the
    commentators connect trusting God with the Sh''mittah''s cancellation of
    debts, or with Scripture''s prohibition against our refusing to make
    uncollectable loans to needy Jews prior to a Sh''mittah . Similarly, neither Maimonides, nor Meir, nor HaChinuch connect trusting God
    with Scripture''s requirement that we allow our land to rest during the
    Sabbatical Year. Meir alone asserts that agricultural commandments
    pertaining to the Sh''mittah are only applicable in Eretz
    Yisrael , and he therefore places them in an appendix, and lists them
    separately from his other mitzvot .'

    the San Hedrin''s obligation to count the Years of Jubilee "year
    by year and Sabbatical cycle by Sabbatical cycle." He also gives much
    attention to justifying why counting fifty days and seven Sabbaths is one mitzvah and not two, but makes no mention of when the count should
    begin. Meir, in contrast, does not even mention that counting both days and
    Sabbaths comprises one commandment, but specifically states that we are to
    start to count the night of the sixteenth of Nisan , and that we are to
    count while standing and accompany the count with a benediction. HaChinuch
    states that we must count forty-nine days from the presentation of the sheaf
    offering, which is the sixteenth of Nisan , and we must utter the day
    count and the week count separately. He agrees that we are to do the count
    while standing and with an accompanying benediction. Despite the different
    way that HaChinuch expresses the number of days counted, all three
    commentators endorse the Pharisaic way of counting - not the Sadducean way.'

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch are almost identical in how they express
    their two mitzvot - the one that prohibits cooking meat in milk, and
    the other that prohibits eating meat cooked in milk. Their mitzvot do
    not specify any specific animal or its age. Since the Scriptures they rely
    on prohibit the cooking (boiling) but not the eating, they need a rationale
    for their mitzvot that prohibit the eating. The rationale they offer
    is that eating meat cooked in milk derives an improper benefit from the
    prohibited cooking. Meir states that we must not benefit from cooking meat
    in milk if both the meat and the milk come from kosher animals, but if
    one or the other is from a non- kosher animal, we may benefit (but, of
    course, not eat). He also states that we may cook fish or locusts in milk
    and eat the resulting product. Maimonides speculates that the reason for the
    Scriptures prohibiting boiling a kid in its mother''s milk has to do with
    idolatrous practices ( Guide to the Perplexed 111:48 ); HaChinuch
    disagrees, but offers no alternative.'

    continuing obligation on the part of the uncircumcised individual to become
    circumcised when he is older. It is interesting that Maimonides and HaChinuch
    state that mothers have no responsibility to circumcise their sons in view of
    Moses'' wife Zipporah having circumcised her son ( Exodus 4:24-26 ). Meir

    idolators and false prophets) are Maimonides'' RP205, Meir''s MP72, and
    HaChinuch''s C239. Maimondes, Meir, and HaChinuch express their mitzvot as our being
    responsible for rebuking sinners without reference to whether or not the sin
    is directed against us. Maimonides includes those who are contemplating but
    have not yet committed sin, whereas Meir and HaChinuch do not touch on that. Another difference in the commentators is that HaChinuch states that one is
    prohibited from correcting a sinner if he believes that his correction will
    not be heeded. For his reason, he cites TB Yebamoth 65b , and
    expresses concern that the righteous admonisher will be disgraced by the

    three myrtle branches, and two willow branches on each of the seven days (but
    not on Shabbat); (3) HaChinuch: Similar to Meir, but adds considerable
    content from the "oral tradition", including the analogy of each species to a
    man''s organs. The etrog is said to be like the heart, the lulav (palm
    branch) like the spine, the myrtle like the eyes, and the willow like the

  classical_commentators: 'Of the three commentators compared herein, Chinuch is the only one who is
    expansive on the subject of how marriage is related to holiness. He states
    that the underlying purpose of the three prohibitions in Leviticus
    21:7 is to preserve the cohen ''s ritual purity for his priestly
    service to God. HaChinuch and Meir point out an irony of the mitzvah that prohibits marriage to a zonah . It is that a woman who copulates
    with an animal is liable to death by stoning, but she is not a zonah because her copulation was not with a man. By inference, therefore, a cohen is not forbidden from marrying her - a strange result of logic.
    HaChinuch and Meir define a chalalah as a woman who is the product of
    a marriage that is prohibited to a cohen , or as a woman who has been
    intimate with a cohen whom she was forbidden to marry. Neither
    Maimonides, nor Meir, nor HaChinuch comment much about the prohibition
    against marrying a g''rushah , nor do they make any exceptions for
    unusual or contemporary circumstances that might be different from those of

  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides and Meir loosely refer to the "first day of Passover" when they

    period from before sundown on the 14 th day of the
    first month ( Nisan 14), to sometime early the next day ( Nisan 15), when the Israelites began their exodus from Egypt. HaChinuch
    specifically refers to Nisan 15, and all three commentators recognize
    the exception from not doing work when food preparation is needed. HaChinuch
    considers the first and seventh days of "Passover" to be a single festival,
    unlike the case of Sh''mini Atzeret . In their writings, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch assume the common
    rabbinical practice in the Diaspora of doubling up on each of the Annual
    Sabbaths except for Yom Kippur . The reason for this duplication is
    interesting, but will not be explored further here.'

    agrees with Maimonides about hallowing the Sabbath with those particular
    words, and adds that we must recite the Kiddush prayer over either
    wine or bread. He also cites Isaiah 58:13 in calling the Sabbath a
    delight, and states that we must honor God by washing our hands and face with
    warm water, dressing in clean clothing, and eating a minimum of three meals.
    HaChinuch is in agreement about hallowing the Sabbath with words. He states
    that the Kiddush should be said over wine, but that the sages have
    allowed it to be said over bread if a man delights in bread more than wine.
    That notwithstanding, HaChinuch maintains that Havdalah must be
