  commentary_juster: 'The issue of Sabbath is paradoxical for Gentiles: The Sabbath, as a day of rest on the seventh day, is never enjoined
    upon Gentiles in the New Covenant. Rabbinical Judaism defined it as
    part of Jewish-specific law, and part of God''s Covenant with Israel -
    not universal law which is required of all people (i.e. the Noachide
    laws). The Sabbath principle is enjoined upon all, at least as a "rest of
    faith". ( Hebrews 4:2-11 ). The passages in Isaiah 56 and 66 indicate a more universal
    observance in the Age to Come than in the Mosaic age. Isaiah 56 may only be referring to Gentiles who are called to live among the
    Jewish people, but Isaiah 66 may well imply a world-wide
    Sabbath day. In the light of the passages in Isaiah , it is certainly
    appropriate for Gentiles to keep one day in seven as unto the Lord
    when it is practically possible within their cultures (remember that
    there was no seven day week in the Roman world at the time the N.T.
    was being written). While it is appropriate for Gentiles in Messiah to
    take the seventh day as their day of rest (and possibly as an
    eschatological sign of the Age to Come), this does not mean that all
    Christian Congregations ought to gather for worship on Saturday.
    Sunday celebrations of the day of Resurrection are certainly
    appropriate and there is, in this age, a choice to make this the day
    of rest also, or to add Sabbath rest on the seventh day to the
    corporate gathering on Sunday, or move the Christian gathering to the
    seventh day and treat it as a day of rest as well. What is culturally
    feasible and best is an important factor in the choice, and is within
    the purview of New Covenant liberty.'

  commentary_juster: 'I believe that when the New Covenant Scriptures speak of a heavenly shofar being sounded upon Yeshua''s return, upon the dead being raised,
    and upon His disciples (then alive) being transformed and caught up with Him
    in the air, they are referring to Yom T''ruah ( 1 Thessalonians
    4:16-17 ; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 ). This can also be connected to
    an eschatological time of universal repentance, including in Israel
    ( Zechariah 12:10 ), that leads to a world-wide "Day of Atonement". If
    so, then the days between Yom T''ruah and Yom Kippur have
    teaching significance for all followers of Yeshua, and enhanced
    responsibility for the Jewish People, and for K''rov Yisrael Gentiles,
    who are charged with fulfilling the commandment to blow and hear the sound of
    the shofar .'

  commentary_juster: 'In modern societies that are not primarily agricultural, the Jubilee (also
    the Sh''mittah ) is difficult to apply. However, there are underlying
    principles that have been noted by many Bible scholars. First, similar to
    the Sh''mittah , the command shows the importance of renewing and
    preserving the land so that it is not worn out. Secondly, the command shows
    that God does not want the ownership of land to create a permanent class of
    landed gentry. The Jubilee promotes equal economic and social opportunity
    that is also the goal of our most enlightened and compassionate governmental
    systems. The Jubilee restoration of land does not mean socialism since there could be
    disparities of wealth by other means (e.g. in gold, silver, herds, etc.).
    However, there is a redistribution of wealth in Jubilee was well, and it
    therefore equalizes opportunity. I think the principle here is not to impose
    taxes for on-going welfare, but to use taxes (especially inheritance taxes)
    to provide education and training so that those without financial means have
    economic opportunity. Perhaps we could call such taxes "equal opportunity
    taxes".'

  commentary_juster: 'Romans 7 makes it clear that we are in the New Covenant Order and not
    the Mosaic when it refers to the widow and indicates that she is now freed
    from her covenant bond. That would not have been the case were we still
    under the Mosaic Covenant. We who are believers have died and been raised in
    the Messiah and, although we have been released from the Mosaic Covenant, we
    are, nevertheless, expected to apply its teaching in a manner that is
    applicable in the New Covenant. Contrary to the idea of secular society, the Bible enjoins all nations to
    acknowledge God and to embrace the principles of God''s Law for the governing
    of the society. In classical Protestant thought first defined by John
    Calvin, this was called the second use of the Law. God''s Law (both Mosaic
    and New Covenant) provides the framework for society''s civil law, so
    followers of Yeshua should work toward bringing their civil society into
    conformity with its principles. The ideal of all nations acknowledging the
    Lordship of God and His Law is repeated throughout the Prophets and the
    Writings.'

  commentary_juster: 'I should like to add perspective to the preceding section 6, " Gentiles who
    live among Jews allowed to eat the Passover lamb if circumcised "
    ( Exodus 12:43-49 ). There is a change of application in the New
    Covenant where Gentiles are not encouraged to be circumcised in order to eat
    the Passover. Yeshua is now our Passover Lamb, and we share the Lamb
    together in the Lord''s Supper without Gentiles having to be circumcised. The
    teaching of the New Covenant is that Gentiles are fully included without
    circumcision, contrary to the orientation of the Mosaic era. There are
    promises and commands that both share equally while, at the same time,
    distinctions of calling are preserved and lived out in different ways
    ( Romans 11:28-29 ). Both share in an equality of priestly status
    ( Ephesians 2:5 ; 1 Peter 2:10 ) with different out-workings of
    their respective priestly callings. An example of this is the general
    calling of the Jewish people to respond to God''s promise of their return to
    the Land of Israel, and to the events leading to the Messianic Days. A Social Caveat There are certain groups where the inclusion of one class of persons and the
    exclusion of all others is socially acceptable. Examples of these are
    age-specific groups such as men''s and women''s Bible studies, B''nei
    Mitzvah classes, and married couples discussion groups. There are also
    specific nationality and racial groups that are formed out of their common
    interests, but their acceptability is usually due to their having a minority
    status. So, for example, a Hispanic discussion group might be acceptable,
    whereas an all-white discussion group almost certainly would not be. The
    problem of social unacceptability surfaces most clearly when persons of a
    specific race, religion, color, or ethnic origin, are excluded from a
    community of the kind where people live, work, and worship together.'

  commentary_juster: 'For those not satisfied that the only rationale for this Mitzvah is
    that it is a standard created by God to make a distinction between Israel and
    the nations, they may consider these others: First is that it is for health. This is argued in " None of These
    Diseases " by S. I. Macmillan. The problem with his position is that not
    all the creatures prohibited in Scripture are clearly unhealthy to eat.
    Certainly, God''s best for Israel is that it be healthy. Second, is the idea
    that the clean-unclean laws (beyond the food laws) show the nature of sin in
    a symbolic way in that certain animals feed off death or, like pigs, are
    unclean because they are filthy (Keil and Delitzsch, " Commentary on the
    Old Testament ", first published in 1866). Third, is " Purity and
    Danger " by Mary Douglas, in which she argues that there was a reasoned
    sense of the ancients as to what was fitting or not fitting - what was whole
    or not whole - in categories of living creatures. It was seen as natural that
    fish should have fins and scales. In her last years before her death, she
    was no longer convinced of her position, and came to believe, instead, that
    there simply were animals that God valued as being free from men''s use. While there is truth in all of these views, it would seem best that we
    embrace the idea that God''s reason for making distinctions is part of
    his making the Jewish people distinct, and that not all of the creatures
    named in Scripture are subject to a human rationale.'

  commentary_juster: 'The use of the Matthew 7:1 phrase " Judge not, that ye be not
    judged. " (KJV) has probably become the most popular biblical verse for
    people who do not want to be accountable for their behavior, and teach that
    no one should evaluate or judge them in any way. This is so obviously wrong
    and foolish. We have to make judgments all the time. Should we trust the
    vacuum salesman, the insurance man, the investment counselor and others? The Bible says to have nothing to do with people who claim to be believers
    who engage in certain sinful practices. In 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 , the
    Apostle Paul instructs the Corinthians to judge a particular man who is
    living in sin and remove him from the fellowship. Also, Matthew
    18:15-17 shows how judgment comes about. So what was Yeshua speaking
    about in Matthew 7:1 ? Hypocrisy and not having a judgmental or
    censorious spirit.'

  commentary_juster: 'Laws of restitution such as referred to in these passages were intended to
    guide the civil courts in ancient Israel. As such, the idea of paying
    damages beyond just restoring what was stolen has become part of most Western
    law systems; the civil laws in the Bible greatly influenced the legal systems
    of the west. On a personal level, the person who repents should restore what
    can be restored and, beyond that, should restore even more as the biblical
    texts suggest. This is so that the pain of the violation is felt by the one
    who has sinned, and is mitigated somewhat by the one who has been sinned
    against. The amounts of restitution specified in the Scriptures can guide
    personal acts of restitution as well as those of the civil courts. When
    personal restitution takes place, court actions can be avoided, keeping in
    mind that 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 prohibits a believer from suing a fellow
    believer in a secular court.'

    So, the command encompasses a principle of their needing to be a way of
    release from debts that lead to destruction. Bankruptcy laws are probably
    the modern social equivalent because the same underlying principle is
    involved. The Biblical text provides that assistance should be made
    available for those truly in need, and the Sabbatical year''s discharge of
    debts, coupled with the requirement that we not harvest the corners of our
    fields (thereby allowing some of our crops to be gleaned) are special
    applications of God''s requirement of us that we care for the poor.'

  commentary_juster: 'My view on this is that, without the support of civil law as we have in
    Israel, it is very difficult for Jews to do all of the Sabbaths (e.g. the
    seventh day of Passover and the 8 th Day of Sh''mini Atzeret ) because the number of days are just too difficult in
    a non-Jewish society. I think Messianic Jews should seek to keep them all as
    an ideal, but there is, in my view, allowance in the Diaspora for some degree
    of indulgence. Regarding Gentiles, there is no requirement for them to embrace the Sabbath
    days, as is made most clear in Colossians 2 , Romans 14 , and Galatians 5 . Also, although there is no evidence in any historical
    text that this was ever expected of Gentile believers, they are not relieved
    from understanding and applying these Sabbath days as their communities and
    they, as individuals, are led by the Holy Spirit. Of course, even when some
    level of compliance is decided upon, Gentiles are not called to add
    extra-biblical rabbinical practices, although they are not prohibited from
    them either. The literal partaking of the Annual Sabbaths is covenantal to
    the Jewish people and would seem to have application to Gentile believers in
    their communities as follows: There should be teachings regarding the meanings of all the Sabbaths. It would be good and reasonable to teach on the Sabbaths in the seasons
    of their actual celebrations in Israel and in the Jewish community.
    This connects the Christian world to the Jewish people with whom they
    are joined through Yeshua ( Romans 11 ). Whenever Christian communities are led to celebrate these Sabbaths, it
    would be sufficient for them to do so on the weekends closest to their
    biblically prescribed dates. Lastly, Christians may choose to abstain from work and rest on these
    Sabbaths (similar to their Jewish brothers) in identification with the
    Jewish people. How the Sabbaths are acknowledged and expressed in each Christian
    community should be led by the Holy Spirit.'
