  commentary_rudolph: 'The statement of this Mitzvah begins "It is halachically prescribed ... rather than "We are to ..." as in other Mitzvot because Genesis 32:33(32) that underlies it is not stated as a commandment; it reads:
    QuoteParagraph This is why, to this day, the people of Isra''el do not eat the thigh
    muscle that passes along the hip socket - because the man struck
    Ya&039;akov&039;s hip at its socket. Although, in Judaism, the above verse of Scripture is halachically treated as a commandment, it cannot be proven to be so because it could
    merely be saying that between the time of Jacob and the time of Moses (when
    we assume Genesis was redacted), the community of Israel elected to remember
    Jacob''s struggle with the "man" by not eating the "sinew of the thigh"
    ( gid hanasheh or "thigh muscle" in the CJB) of an animal that passes
    along the hip socket. It is because Jacob''s own thigh muscle was
    damaged when the "man" with whom he wrestled all night touched his hip socket
    in order to force the contest to an end. 1 The "man''s" identity is shrouded in mystery, but it is apparent that he
    contained "the fullness of all that God is
    ..." 2 because Jacob
    said of him in Genesis 32:31(30) : "I have seen God face to face, yet my life is spared." Whoever the "man" was, it is clear that Jacob spent all night wrestling in
    the pursuit of a blessing to which God had already committed Himself through
    His earlier promise to Abraham; nevertheless, the "man" with whom Jacob
    wrestled declared in Genesis 32:39(28) : "From now on, you will no longer be called Ya''akov, but Isra''el; because
    you have shown your strength to both God and men and have prevailed." While the apparent complement was given for Jacob''s tenacious pursuit of the
    godly objective of acquiring a blessing, it was unnecessary for him to be
    injured in the process of acquiring it, and he wouldn''t have been, had he
    trusted God''s promise (about which he knew) instead of trying to extract the
    blessing through his own strength. It was a characteristic of Jacob to act in
    the flesh, and it was not the first time that he sought God''s blessing
    through fleshly means ( Genesis 27:1-35 ). It is worthy of note that
    Jacob did not win the wrestling match, and the "man" (who was clearly a
    supernatural being) did not lose it since he clearly could have killed Jacob
    had he wanted to. Many in today''s Jewish community comply with Jewish law and custom by not
    eating the sinew of an animal''s hip ( Genesis 32:33(32) ), but we also
    understand the Scripture''s twofold lesson for us, which is: (1) like Jacob,
    we must be zealous in our pursuit of godly things; but (2) unlike Jacob, we
    must do so in faith, and in reliance on God''s strength - not on our own. We
    must submit to God and not wrestle with Him, lest He have to disable us as He
    did Jacob. There are many Scriptures that teach this principle; I will list
    but a few here: Zechariah 4:6b ''Not by force, and not by power, but by my Spirit,'' says
    ADONAI-Tzva''ot. Psalm 105:4 Seek ADONAI and his strength; always seek his presence. Proverbs 3:5-6 Trust in ADONAI with all your heart; do not rely on your own understanding.
    In all your ways acknowledge him; then he will level your paths. Ephesians 6:10 Finally, grow powerful in union with the Lord, in union with his mighty
    strength! Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through him who gives me power. James 4:7 Therefore, submit to God. Moreover, take a stand against the Adversary, and
    he will flee from you. There is a practical problem to overcome when we seek to abstain from eating
    meat from an animal''s thigh unless we purchase our meat exclusively from a kosher source (the origin of chopped beef or "hamburger" from
    non- kosher sources is often not labeled and is unknown). Kosher meat is not always available, so the next simplest solution in
    attemptingto comply with halachah is to learn the cuts of meat that
    come from an animal''s hind quarter (sometimes referred to as
    non- kosher cuts) and avoid them. There is, however, another but more
    laborious solution, which is for the consumer or the butcher to search for
    and remove all sinew-like structures in meat that comes from an animal''s
    thigh; these would include veins, nerves, tendons, and cartilage. God does
    not expect the average person to be an anatomist or have the time to do it,
    so I am confident that making a reasonable effort to avoid eating meat from
    an animal''s hind quarter is sufficient, although not required unless
    ascribing to a community''s standard that seeks to build a fence around the Torah . Interestingly, Orthodox halachah sometimes establishes
    an even greater fence around the Torah by prohibiting the consumption
    of meat from behind an animal''s 13th rib, which is the entire rear half of
    the animal - not just the hind quarter. There is one more issue that needs to be thought of whenever we depart from halachic kashrut , and that is how it may affect our hospitality to
    guests who keep rabbinically kosher . There is no one solution I can
    recommend other than to inquire of our guests'' needs and do our best to
    comply. It is sometimes expedient to avoid serving meat altogether. 1. Scholars argue over
    exactly what the gid hanasheh was, some calling it "muscle", others
    "nerve", and still others "tendon". For most practical purposes it does
    not matter, because the laws of kashrut require that all visible
    nerves, tendons, and veins be removed from the hind quarter of an animal if
    the hind quarter is to be used for food. Because such preparation is often
    cost-prohibitive, it is the common Jewish practice (except where food is
    scarce) to not eat the hind quarter of an animal at all. 2. See Colossians 2:9 (CJB).'

  commentary_rudolph: 'We are commanded by Deuteronomy 6:16 not to put God to the test. What
    this means is that we must believe God in that whatever He says He will do,
    and not intentionally act in such a way as to force His hand and provoke Him
    to prove it. The bottom line is that we must trust and not doubt God''s
    warnings and promises. In Matthew 4:5-7 , we read how Yeshua Himself
    demonstrated the principle by refusing to jump from the Temple in order to
    prove His identity by forcing His Father to save Him supernaturally. There are two instances in Scripture where God seems to be saying the
    opposite. One of them is in Judges 6:36-40 , where Gid''on asks God for
    supernatural signs of His Word. But Gid''on was not testing God; he believed
    God. On the contrary, he was doubting the accuracy with which he was hearing
    God, and was testing himself. The other instance is in Malachi 3:10 ,
    in which God says, in part: " Bring the whole tenth into the storehouse, so
    that there will be food in my house, and put me to the test ... " This is
    not a contradiction of the Deuteronomy 6:16 commandment either,
    because here God is not asking doubters or unbelievers to put Him to test Him
    in order to prove His truthfulness. He is lovingly beseeching Israelite
    believers to follow His instructions so that they can have and enjoy His
    promised blessings.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'First, we should understand that "faith" and "trust" as it applies to God are
    identical, and merely a translator''s choice of words. Some interpret Mark
    11:23-24 as assuring us that if we strongly believe for anything, God has
    obligated Himself to make it happen. But that is not at all what the
    Scripture says or implies. The Scripture says " whoever does not doubt in
    his heart but trusts that what he says will happen ... " There is only
    one way for us to not doubt in our heart for something, and that is for God
    to have placed it there. Then, having recognized what God''s will is, if we
    trust Him and speak it, it will happen. God is not calling us to what is often called "positive confession", because
    in "positive confession" the presumption is that we have the power to control
    God and cause Him to do what we want him to do. Do we want a new car? The
    proponents of positive confession would say that all we must do is believe
    strongly enough for it and we will have it. No! God is calling us to first
    discern His will, and then trust Him enough to speak it aloud. If we
    properly hear God''s will and speak it in faith, we can be assured that it
    will come to pass.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'If we understand that the "gods" in Exodus 20:3 are not only false
    deities, but rather all persons, matters, and things to which we "bow down"
    (i.e. put ahead of God and allow to control our lives), we understand how it
    is the quintessential Scripture that supports this Mitzvah . After
    that, Matthew 6:33 calls us to faith by exhorting us to " ... seek
    first his Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given
    to you as well. " It is telling us that, despite our perceived needs and
    natural inclination to dwell on them, if we put our attention on God instead
    of ourselves, He will see to it that our needs are met.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'God''s commandments that we assemble with each other and with Him, are
    initially given during the time of the Mosaic Covenant. Early in the
    Covenant, the Tabernacle served as the place of assembly for the Israelites
    to receive communication from God, to pray, and to perform the commanded
    sacrifices. The Tabernacle and later the Temple also served as places where
    the Israelites could assemble with each other (e.g. Joshua 18:1 ), and
    by the time of Yeshua, the synagogue and individual homes also had become
    places of communal assembly - mainly for prayer, but also for study and
    discussion. With the advent of the New Covenant, Jewish and Gentile followers of Yeshua
    made increased use of their homes for worship, prayer, and fellowship
    ( Acts 2:46 , 5:42 ), and these home gatherings developed into
    what eventually became known within Christianity as "home churches", and
    within Messianic Judaism as "home fellowships", " chavurot " or, when
    they have elder leadership, "congregations". Scripture enjoins believers 1 to be in regular congregational fellowship
    with one another ( Hebrews 10:24-25 ) as a means of providing mutual
    spiritual protection and accountability. Being part of a believing community
    enables us to observe one another''s lives, share our burdens, and rebuke and
    correct one another ( Galatians 6:1 ) in the event that we observe any
    of us falling into sin or straying from the faith. Congregational community
    also provides us with leaders (elders) whose responsibility it is to protect
    the community from outside evil encroachment ( Acts 20:28-29 ), to stop
    sin when it is observed ( Acts 20:30 ), to bring correction to members
    of the community, to judge disputes ( Matthew 18:17 ), and to maintain
    reconciliation among community members ( Luke 17:3 ; Colossians
    3:13 ). 1. In this Mitzvah , the term
    "brother" (applies to both males and females) means either a believer in
    God the Father and/or in Yeshua the Messiah, according to the context of
    its use. To the classical commentators (Maimonides, Meir, and Hachinuch),
    "brother" means "fellow Jew".'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Righteousness is the quality of being morally right or justifiable. A
    righteous man always seeks to do what is right but, if he errs in innocence,
    he remains righteous because his character in desiring to do right is
    unchanged. Similarly but opposite, a man of unrighteous character can stumble
    into doing things that are right from time to time but, if his character is
    unchanged, he remains unrighteous. This Mitzvah anticipates times when doing the right thing seem risky
    due to possible adverse consequences that we foresee and fear, or at least
    would prefer to avoid. At such times of decision we are tempted to disregard
    what we know is right and, instead, do what seems safest. The foregoing
    Scriptures call us instead to faith, and to three simple steps: (1) Determine
    what''s right; (2) Do it; (3) Trust God to take care of the consequences.
    These steps are exemplified by Esther''s heroism in Esther 4:7-16 , and
    are the natural follow-through from 2 Corinthians 5:7 that reminds us: for we live by trust, not by what we see. Or, as the New King James Version translates the Greek: We walk by faith, not by sight. The Bible, beginning to end, describes the righteous character of God, and
    exhorts us to aspire to be like him - righteous. There are so many
    Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah that I have elected to save space
    by printing out the text of those from the Torah and the Gospel books,
    and only citing the others by chapter and verse.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is a natural consequence of the Mitzvah "Loving
    Our Neighbor, the Stranger, and Even Our Enemy." Scripture requires that we
    help our neighbor who is in need whether or not we are asked, and whether or
    not he is a friend. Scripture also commands that help be given even at a
    cost to ourselves, and therein lies the greatest challenge, which is, "How
    far must we go to help, and at how great a cost?" Do we give to our neighbor
    financially to the extent of impoverishing ourselves and our family? Do we
    rise from our battlefield trench to help our fallen enemy only to get shot
    ourselves? Throughout life, we encounter situations of these kinds, usually
    not as extreme, but similar in that helping our neighbor risks something, or
    takes something away from us with certainty. It may be money, it may be
    property, it may be time, and it may occasionally be life. There is no
    biblical formula for when to help, for how much to help, or for whom to help
    in a given circumstance. We must be tuned into and rely on the Holy Spirit
    to guide us.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Honoring our father and mother involves respecting them for their parental
    position both privately and in public. It also implies obeying them when we
    are young, but never in a way that disobeys or dishonors God. Although,
    by promising long life in the land, it is clear that Exodus 20:12 and Ephesians 6:1-3 are addressing Israelites, the instructions they
    convey are morally universal and are therefore appplicable for Gentiles as
    well. The King James Version of the Bible translates " tira''u " (derived
    from " yara ") in Leviticus 19:3 as " Ye shall fear ",
    whereas other versions translate the word "revere" or "respect". We are not
    to be frightened by our parents (that is not the kind of "fear" of them we
    are to have). We are rather to regard them with awesome respect, for God
    holds them accountable to train us up in righteousness ( Proverbs
    22:6 ), and He holds us accountable for how we treat them - how we speak
    of them, and how we speak to them. We are not to usurp their authority,
    speak for them (unless asked), contradict them before others in a way
    that would cause them embarrassment or dishonor and, of course, not curse
    them or strike them. Our obligation to honor and revere God ( Proverbs
    3:9 ; Leviticus 24:15 ; Deuternomy
    6:13 ) 4 ,
    and it is incumbent upon us, even should they do wrong to us or follow
    ungodly paths in aspects of their personal lives. The relevance of 1 Timothy 5:8 is that providing materially for
    one''s parents, especially when they are at an advanced age, is one way of
    honoring and revering them, and not supporting them when there is a need to
    do so is the opposite. It is commonly thought that 1 Timothy 5:8 is
    only a reference to husbands supporting their wives and children, but the
    context in the ancient world (as well as in many places in the world today)
    included one''s parents, because aging parents commonly lived with (or close
    by) their children. This principle is verified in Meir''s commentary to his mitzvah MP41. 4. Similar to the King James Version''s translation
    of "tira''u" in Leviticus 19:3 , most translators of Deuteronomy 6:13 translate "tira" (also derived from "yara") as
    "fear".'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Sabbath was first described in Genesis 2:2-3 as the seventh day
    that God rested, and declared holy, following the six days of creation.
    Later, God commanded the Israelites to keep the Sabbath as a day to rest,
    refrain from work, and conduct a holy convocation
    ( Leviticus 23:3 ) 1 .
    He also made the Sabbath applicable to Gentiles - not as a commandment - but
    as a source of blessing ( Isaiah 56:1-7 ). My belief is, therefore,
    that keeping the seventh day Sabbath is law for the Jew, and blessing for the
    Gentile. Conversely, not to keep the Sabbath is sin for the Jew and a
    blessing lost for the Gentile. In the New Covenant Scriptures, Hebrews
    4:1-11 compares "Sabbath rest" with "spiritual rest" that is received
    through having faith in Messiah Yeshua; that, of course, is applicable to Jew
    and non-Jew alike. Since rest is the cessation of work, it is important to know the kind of work
    that is prohibited on the Sabbath. Exodus 23:12 provides part of the
    answer, for if we are to work six days of the week and rest on the seventh,
    the work referred to must be ordinary work of the kind we engage in for our
    livelihood and
    sustenance 2 .
    This would seem to mean that, on the Sabbath, carpentry is forbidden for the
    carpenter and cooking is forbidden for the cook, leaving open the possibility
    that such activities might be engaged in by persons who do them for pure
    enjoyment or recreation. Some would say that it is not so, because Isaiah
    58:13-14 prohibits our pursuing personal interests on the Sabbath. I do
    not interpret the Scripture that way; I believe it is warning us away from
    pursuing interests that are at odds with God''s interests and from doing usual
    things that would detract from making the Sabbath day special. So, for
    example, if immersing ourselves in outdoor nature adds to our Shabbat
    shalom , the fact that we find it interesting and pleasurable should not
    render it a prohibited activity. On the other hand, we should probably not
    use the Sabbath to continue our methodical study of birds that we began
    earlier in the week (restful though it may be) because then we would not be
    treating the day as special. Such decisions are personal and should be
    resolved through communion with the Holy Spirit. I would be remiss were I not to mention that the Rabbinical understanding of
    what constitutes work includes things that are creative, the reason being
    that when God rested on the seventh day, He rested from "creating". That is
    why the rabbis forbid Sabbath activities that include writing and composing.
    It is also why the Pharisees in the First Century objected to Yeshua healing
    on the Sabbath (see Luke supra); healing and performing miracles was
    considered creative, and therefore a violation of the Sabbath (healing to
    save a life has always been permitted as an exception). Messianic Judaism follows Yeshua''s example in desiring to see healings and
    other miracles occur on the Sabbath, and we therefore have no hesitation in
    "laying on of hands" and praying for healing. Nor do we hesitate to write
    down godly inspirations we may receive, or do other things to make the
    Sabbath a delight rather than a burden. When God looked over what He had
    made, declared it "good" and later rested and gave us a Sabbath of rest as
    well, He was not supposing that we were engaged in creating things the
    previous six days and therefore needed to stop. He was summoning us to a day
    of rest in Him by reflecting on His Creation and affirmatively seeking His
    power for our restoration. Our position on this is that we may be creative
    on the Sabbath so long as it is not our usual work, and is an appropriate
    reflection of Him, and a reminder that we were created in His image. There is a category of ordinary work that is clearly not forbidden on the
    Sabbath. It is work that is ministerial, because it is analogous to the work
    of the cohanim who were required to conduct Sabbath sacrifices in the
    Temple as part of their priestly duties. Modern Judaism is split on works of compassion - e.g. works that heal or
    maintain safety, but there is uniform agreement that working to save a life
    is permitted. Messianic Judaism, in contrast, follows the example of Yeshua,
    and considers that works of compassion are not only permitted on the Sabbath,
    but are encouraged. A rare category of work that is permitted on the Sabbath is work that must be
    undertaken so as not to violate another commandment of God. Thus a mohel is permitted to circumcise on the eighth day after the birth of
    a Jewish boy even if it falls on a Shabbat . These exceptions to the Mitzvah are generally accepted within Messianic Judaism and Judaism
    broadly; other possible exceptions need to be discerned through prayerfully
    seeking guidance from the Ruach HaKodesh . Abstaining from work on the Sabbath is not only an act of obedience - it is
    an act of faith for, by so doing, we are trusting God to provide for us. An
    example of this is found in Exodus 16:22-30 , where the Israelites had
    to trust God to provide them with food during the Shabbat when they
    were not allowed to gather manna. 1. See also, Isaiah 66:23-24 and Hebrews 10:24-25 . 2. The Orthodox Rabbinical community goes beyond this
    by adhering to a complex set of rules and a list of prohibited activities
    that are derived from the Babylonian Talmud ( Shab. 75a )'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Amazing as it seems, disciples of Yeshua have been given spiritual authority
    to permit or prohibit things to happen on earth that are reflected in heaven.
    This is sometimes referred to as "binding" and "loosing", and is conditioned
    upon our using the authority in a way that is consistent with God''s will. The
    authority is given to us as servants of Yeshua, and whereas it is our
    decision when to use it, it must be understood that we do so "in the name
    of Yeshua", and that it is Yeshua and not we that brings the result to
    pass. 1 "Loosing" from disease and "binding" of healing is a spiritual authority we
    have been given among others. According to the Scripture, we have authority
    (in the name of Yeshua) to declare healing, to cast out demons, and even to
    raise from the dead. In the western world we experience our authority to
    cast out demons fairly often, to heal not so often, and to raise from the
    dead almost never. We do, however, receive testimonies from believers of
    these happening in other parts of the world where all three appear to be
    substantially active. Why not also here in the western world is speculative. A special explanation is needed concerning our authority to forgive sins
    pursuant to John 20:23 , as we generally consider that in Yeshua''s
    exclusive domain. John 20:23 states: If you forgive someone''s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you hold
    them, they are held. Clearly, this is an extension and secondary application of our authority to
    "bind" and "loose", but it is limited to sins that are committed against us
    personally and is not authority to forgive sins generally. One way to
    understand this is to first consider Luke 17:3-4 , which commands us to
    forgive sins that are committed against us if the perpetrator of the sins
    repents ( Luke 17:3-4 ). God gives that authority to the victims of sin
    in order to put a burden on the perpetrator to approach the person he or she
    injured and try to make it right. The John 20:23 Scripture should be
    looked at in the same way. Finally, batei din have authority to "bind" and "loose". Reminiscent
    of Deuteronomy 17:8-13 , God gives authority to our batei din to
    hear and decide cases, and He honors those beit din judgments that are
    appropriately rendered: Matthew 18:17-18: If he refuses to hear them, tell the
    congregation [the beit din]; and if he refuses to listen even to the
    congregation [beit din], treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector
    [unbeliever]. Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth
    will be prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be
    permitted in heaven. So, therefore, if a beit din makes such a finding we are to treat the
    adjudged person as no longer a believer. 2 1. It is not we who do the miracles, but rather they are
    caused by our declarations on earth being reflected in Heaven. 2. In the New Covenant,
    the judicial authority of the Apostles (and today''s elders) replaced
    that of the Sanhedrin .'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Charity, in the Jewish world, is known as tz''dakah . The first thing
    to notice about the Scriptures that underlie this commandment is that they do
    not limit tz''dakah to giving for, as you can see in Deuteronomy
    15:8 and Leviticus 25:36 , lending to the poor without charging
    interest is considered a work of tz''dakah as well. Leviticus
    25:35 begins by referring to "a member of your people", and charges us
    with a duty to help our brother Israelite so that he (and presumably his
    family) can continue to live among us, meaning whatever style of living is
    par in our community. A charitable burden such as this cannot be complied
    with by the average person or family, so it is reasonable that the Scripture
    intends a considerable part of it to be fulfilled communally. Also,
    although the term "your people" meant fellow Israelites, for us the
    commandment should be broadened to mean fellow Jews (be we Jewish), and
    fellow brothers in Messiah, be we Jews or not. The heart of the commandment is that God wants us to take responsibility for
    our impoverished brother''s welfare and, in order to be able to do so, our
    communities must establish some level of financial safety net for its
    members. If we do not, brothers on whom hard times fall will have to move
    away from the community, and the inevitable result is fractured
    relationships, which is not God''s intent. The possibility of emergency and
    sometimes long-term needs developing within any congregational community
    suggests the wisdom of the community establishing a benevolence fund;
    administering such a fund, as well as coordinating other resources (both
    congregational and personal), is one of the important functions of a
    deaconate ( shamashim ). Besides the corporate measures I spoke of, the Scriptures I mentioned suggest
    that we have personal responsibility as well. For that reason, we ought to
    develop a plan for giving charity that includes setting aside funds, and
    opening our homes with which HaShem has blessed us, to provide
    emergency sheltering when needed. The degree to which we must funds
    and resources from our own families in order to give to others is not clear
    from the Scriptures, so we must pray for the Holy Spirit to give us guidance
    before (and certainly when) the need to give occurs. Another thing to notice in the Scriptures is that Leviticus 25:35 implies that we are also to give tz''dakah to those who we do not count
    as brothers, for it says " ... you are to assist him as you would a
    foreigner or a temporary resident. " The way this is put is interesting
    because it suggests that we would have no question or hesitation in helping
    the foreigner, whereas we need a commandment to motivate us to help those
    closer to us. Could it be that we sometimes have less compassion for our
    family and peers than we do for strangers? Our obligation to a give to others in need is carried over to the New
    Covenant Scriptures with such strength that it might as well have been
    presented as a commandment there as well. 1 John 3:17 equates
    withholding tz''dakah from our brother with our not loving God, and James 2:14-17 tells us that our charitable acts are an indication of
    the level of our faith. Luke 6:38 is interesting in its application
    of sowing and reaping, but I prefer to not think in those terms because I do
    not want to taint any charitable act on my part with even a fleeting thought
    of self-interest. In addition to it being required by Torah , giving tz''dakah is a
    time-honored practice in Jewish homes where a tz''dakah box for spare
    coins is often in plain view. It is further my opinion that giving tz''dakah should always be over and above other giving that is required
    of us, including our tithes and other offerings.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Leviticus Scripture referenced above commands that all citizens of
    Israel are to live in sukkot for the seven days of the Feast (of Sukkot ), and it gives the reason - so that each generation of Israel
    will remember God''s provision of shelter for us when He brought us out of

    mean only those Jews who live in the Land, the expression that follows it -
    "the people of Isra''el" - broadens its meaning to include all Jewish People,
    wherever in the world they may live. I believe it is also applicable to
    Gentiles who permanently live within the Jewish community ( K''rovei
    Yisrael ) because those whom God brought out of Egypt were a mixed
    multitude that consisted of both Jews and Gentiles ( Exodus 12:38 ).
    That may be part of the explanation for why worshiping God on Sukkot is required of all the Gentile nations ( Zechariah 14:16-19 ). Living
    in a sukkah during the Feast is not a requirement for Gentiles who are
    not K''rov Yisrael , but they may do so if they deem it meaningful. The matter of how often one must physically occupy a sukkah during the
    seven days of the Feast, and what functions one must perform there in order
    that it be counted as "dwelling" is a matter of interpretation, especially in
    the Diaspora where climate and other considerations have to be considered. A
    minimum standard that is common among Diaspora Jews is to eat at least one
    meal each day in a sukkah . John 7 references a Sukkot Feast that Yeshua attended, but
    there is no description of the sukkah in which He must have lived
    during the seven days. Nevertheless, the theme of Sukkot (which is
    living under God''s provision and protection) is very much a New Covenant
    theme, with Yeshua, Ru''ach HaKodesh and the B''rit Chadashah Scriptures being the main New Covenant provisions.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is a repeated teaching of Scripture that cleanliness of a man''s body is
    analogized to cleanliness of his spirit. Scripture teaches that both are
    important, but that cleanliness of spirit is weightier in that if a man''s
    spirit is not clean, no amount of washing with water can cleanse him. A man
    becomes spiritually clean by submitting himself in obedience to God,
    repenting of his sins, and receiving Messiah Yeshua as his personal savior. Some of you used to do these things [premarital sex, idol worship,
    adultery, homosexuality, theft, greed, drunkenness]. But you have cleansed
    yourselves, you have been set apart for God, you have come to be counted
    righteous through the power of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and the Spirit of
    our God. (1 Corinthians 6:11) If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he is trustworthy and just, he
    will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing. (1 John 1:9)'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Romans 1:19-20 says that godless and wicked people are without excuse
    for not knowing God because God''s qualities (His eternal power and divine
    nature) are clearly seen in "what He has made". What He has made is another
    way of saying His creation. I am assuming that no one reading this Mitzvah is in the category of being godless and wicked or he would not
    very likely be reading it, so I will address my following remarks to those
    who are not yet convinced about God''s existence, and to the rest of us who
    already know Him, want more of Him, and aspire to His virtues. Since what can be known about God (His existence and His nature) are there
    for all to see by observing His creation, then we are remiss if we do not
    seek to observe His creation at every opportunity. But how can Romans
    1:19-20 make such a sweeping statement - that everyone, everywhere, can
    know about God merely by observing His creation? If we were to point to some
    item of God''s creation and ask a typical unbeliever to explain how it could
    have come about without God, he would very likely respond with the Darwinism
    he had been taught - that it came about from organic compounds in the oceans
    that combined and, through natural selection, evolved to its present state.
    Now to me, the logic of that happening is so implausible as to defy
    imagination, but not to a person who has been taught that, and that has not
    yet had a personal encounter with God. I would fare no better were I to show the unbeliever what the Bible says
    about God because unbelievers do not believe the Bible either. Now the
    negative picture I have painted does not mean that I should not try, because
    (1) it is my obligation under the instruction of Matthew 28:16-20 , and
    (2) the Holy Spirit might anoint my words and make Himself known to the
    unbeliever at that moment or thereafter, and that, of course, will make all
    the difference. But whether I see it happen or not, I have an obligation to
    bring the truth of God (including the salvation brought by Yeshua) to the
    unbeliever at every opportunity. Although I cannot predict when God will
    come to him, I can nevertheless bring him face-to-face with God through
    speaking the words of Scripture, and through an effective presentation of
    God''s creation. But what is an effective presentation? I previously hypothesized an
    unbeliever who rejected the idea of God''s existence even after I showed him
    something of God''s creation and challenged him to explain by logic how it
    could have come about without God. So, that is not the approach I recommend.
    The approach I recommend is to show Him God''s creation in nature, and draw
    his attention to its goodness and beauty. Ask him: "Do you see beauty in
    this tree?" "Do you see beauty in this other tree?" "Do you see beauty in
    all of these trees?" How come? They are all shaped differently, yet they
    are all picture-beautiful, and there is nothing about their beauty that has
    anything to do with their survivability. The unbeliever will admit to seeing
    beauty in the trees I show him because we, being part of God''s creation and
    having been made in His image, have an instinctive understanding of goodness
    and beauty. There is no logic to it and there is no usefulness to it. Trees
    would be just as functional in adding oxygen to the environment, just as
    useful to nesting birds, and just as survivable in a forest crowded by other
    trees, if they were ugly instead of beautiful. Darwin''s theory of evolution
    through natural selection does not explain why the natural world is filled
    with beauty, and the truth of that will not be lost on the unbeliever. But we ought not to consider this Mitzvah to be only for the
    unbeliever, because the rest of us (who already know Him) want to (and have a
    need to) regularly encounter Him, and one of the ways is to observe and
    contemplate what He has made - His creation, that God Himself said was very
    good. You have no doubt noticed that, in speaking of God''s creation, I have
    associated goodness with beauty, and have shown you how relying on the beauty
    of God''s creation can impress an unbeliever and bring him to the place of
    considering the existence of God and Messiah. Genesis 1:1-31 says
    that God saw, on five of the six days of creation, that what He had made was
    "good," and the Hebrew words used for "good" in all five are " ki-tov ".
    Now although " tov " is very often translated as "good", it is not the
    only possibility and, in fact the word (and concept of) "good" is quite hard
    to define. What, for example comprises that which is good? The way
    something looks? The way it feels? The way it tastes? The way it works?
    When we consult the prestigious Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew
    Lexicon 1 for the definition of " tov ", we get all of these possibilities: (1)
    good; (2) pleasing; (3) delightful; (4) delicious; sweet or savory; (5) pure
    and clean; (6) cheerful; (7) happy; (8) glad; (9) joyful; (10) kind; (11)
    acceptable; (12) vigorous; (13) excellent; (14) fair; and (15) beautiful. It
    is this last definition - "beautiful" - that I suggest is a better
    translation of " tov " in Genesis 1:1-31 , because then the verses
    of Genesis read: On day 1 God created light, and " God saw that the light was
    beautiful. " On day 2 God separated sky from water, and on day 3 He created
    land, the seas, grass, plants, fruit trees and seed-bearing fruit, and
    " God saw that it was beautiful. " On day 4 God created day and night, seasons, days, years, the sun, the
    moon and the stars, and " God saw that it was beautiful. " On day 5 God created swimming creatures, birds, sea creatures and
    creeping creatures, all of which could reproduce, and " God saw that it was
    beautiful. " On day 6 God created other living creatures, livestock, crawling
    animals, wild beasts, and man, and " God saw that it was beautiful. " Finally, at the end of day 6 , just before He rested on the Shabbat , " God saw everything that he had made, and indeed it was
    very beautiful. " Now perhaps you are thinking that substituting "beautiful" for "good" as a
    translation of " tov " is forcing it to suit the purposes of this Mitzvah . Not So! Here are three occurrences in Genesis where a
    derivative of " tov " is translated as "beautiful" or "attractive" in
    the NKJ, NIV, NAS, and yes, even in the Jewish Publication Society''s
    TNK. 2 In the CJB: Genesis 6:2 : " ... the sons of God saw that the daughters of men
    were attractive " The Hebrew word used for "attractive" is
    " ki-tovat ". Genesis 24:16 : " The girl was very beautiful, " The Hebrew word
    used for "beautiful" is " tovat ". Genesis 26:7 : " After all, she is a beautiful woman. " The
    Hebrew word used for "beautiful" is " ki-tovat ". It is similar in many other Scriptures; for example, in Esther 1:11 ,
    the word for "beautiful" is " ki-tovat ". In Daniel 1:4 , it is
    " v''tovei ," in 1 Samuel 9:2 its first occurrence is
    " v''tov ," further in the verse it is " tov ," and in 2 Samuel
    11:2 the Hebrew word is " tovat ". All variations of " tov ",
    and all translated "beautiful". If we use it in Psalm 106:1 , we get: Give thanks to ADONAI; for he is beautiful, for his grace continues
    forever. Not bad - in fact, beautiful! 1. New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew &

  commentary_rudolph: 'The commandment in Exodus 16:29 that is reflected in this Mitzvah was given to the Israelites after they tried to gather manna
    on the Sabbath despite God having provided a double portion for them the day
    before. In today''s context, it calls for us to trust that God will provide
    sufficiently for us six days of the week, so that we should not even
    contemplate leaving our homes in order to work on the Sabbath. In my opinion,
    this is not a requirement that we stay in our house or limit the distance
    that we may travel, but rather it is a requirement that we examine why we are
    leaving our house, lest it be to go to work. In addition to other considerations, it is important to remember that God
    first established the seventh day as holy prior to the Mosaic Covenant, and
    at a time when there was, as of yet, no Israel ( Genesis 2:2-3 ). Later,
    speaking through the prophet Isaiah, God said that non-Jews who keep His
    Sabbaths will receive blessings for doing so ( Isaiah 56:1-7 ). Further
    confirmation for this is found in Hebrews 4:1-11 which compares
    Sabbath rest with spiritual rest that comes from faith in Messiah. This is
    not to say that keeping the seventh day Sabbath is required for Gentile
    believers in this age. We again note the clearly stated passages in Romans 14 , Galatians 5 , Colossians 2 , and others, that
    relieve Gentiles of Sabbath responsibility.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is formulated from Scriptures distributed throughout the
    Bible that describe, in detail, how God made Israel (i.e. the Jewish People)
    into a "Kingdom of Priests", and later created a New Covenant priesthood with
    followers of Yeshua joined to Israel in a "Commonwealth" that conists of
    both Jews and Gentiles. Israel''s calling to be a Kingdom of Priests was imparted to it by God
    (through Abraham and later through Moses), so all Jews (regardless of their
    belief in Messiah) are members of a priestly people. That notwithstanding,
    in the New Covenant, only those Jews who believe in Yeshua, i.e. who are
    "born of the Spirit" and consequently reside as branches on the Romans
    11:16ff olive tree (a tree that belongs to the Jews), can function in
    their full power as New Covenant priests; Jews who do not believe in Yeshua
    have priestly potential and a continued degree of priestly effectiveness, but
    they cannot serve as true New Covenant priests until they come to faith in
    Yeshua. When Gentiles come to faith, they become grafted into the aforesaid olive
    tree and join their Jewish brethren there as co-priests. Although they (the
    Gentiles) do not become Jews by virtue of their having been grafted in, the
    priesthood they become joined to (sometimes referred to as the "Priesthood of
    Believers") is fundamentally a Jewish priesthood. Yet, the Bible makes it
    clear that the Jews in this Priesthood retain their Jewish identities and
    Jewish covenantal responsibilities. The origin of all of this goes back to Genesis 12:1-3 , where God gave
    Avram a covenant whereby through him " all the families of the earth
    would be blessed. " Avram''s name was later changed to Avraham (Abraham)
    and, over several Genesis chapters, we read that God promised that he
    would become " the father of many nations ", that his wife Sarai (whose
    name was changed to Sarah) would bear him a son, and that, through Abraham''s
    descendants, " all the nations of the earth would be blessed. "
    ( Genesis 17:3-7, 15-21, 22:10-18, 26:1-5, & 28:10-14 ). The Priestly Covenant given to Abraham was transmitted through Isaac and
    later Jacob ( Genesis 17:3-7, 26:3-4, 27:29, 28:12-14, & 35:10-12 ), and
    was declared by God (at Mt. Sinai) to the entire Nation of Israel by His
    words: ... you will be a kingdom of cohanim [priests] for me, a nation set
    apart (Exodus 19:3-6) The Tribe of Levi was set apart from the rest of Israel to serve God in the
    Tabernacle (later the Temple), and Aaron and his sons were further set apart
    to serve as priests. This became known as the Levitical Priesthood in the
    "Order of Aaron" because Aaron was its first High Priest. It was the
    functioning priesthood for its time, and the shadow of a heavenly priesthood
    (later to be revealed) in which Yeshua the Messiah would be High Priest in
    the Order of Malki-Tzedek ( Hebrews 3:1-2, 4:14-15, 5:4-6, 6:19-20,
    7:17-8:13, 9:6-12, 24-26, & 10:19-23 ). Levites and Levitical cohanim (known descendants of Levi and Aaron) continue to have
    functions and responsibilities in the synagogues and Jewish Communities of
    today. These include performing special duties in the Torah service,
    pronouncing blessings over the synagogue assembly, officiating at Pidyon
    HaBenim , and several others. From the time of Abraham to the present time, all the covenants that God made
    were with the Jewish people, and the priesthoods related to them were
    Jewish-based priesthoods. The Law given at Mt. Sinai that created and
    defined the Levitical Priesthood did not allow Gentiles and non-Levitical
    Jews to perform priestly services in the Temple, but the New Covenant opened
    the way for both to become priests by joining themselves to the Romans
    11 "Jewish" olive tree through faith in the "Jewish" Messiah Yeshua. Just as the Levitical priests had duties related to the Temple''s animal
    sacrifices, New Covenant priests have duties related to the sacrificed "lamb
    of God" Yeshua. In Matthew 28:16-20 and parallel Scriptures, we read
    that Yeshua directed His disciples (all Jews) to go and make people from all nations into talmidim (disciples), immersing
    them into the reality of the Father, the Son and the Ruach HaKodesh, and
    teaching them to obey everything [they had been commanded]. This commandment to preach the "Good News" of Yeshua to the utmost ends of
    the earth (commonly referred to as the "Great Commission") is the main
    priestly duty of the "Yeshua Priesthood of Believers". It is the New
    Covenant counterpart of Temple service but, unlike Temple service, it is open
    to (in fact it is required of) all disciples of Yeshua, whether they be Jews
    or Gentiles. Finally, according to Romans 1:16, 2:9-11 , "Great Commission" ministry
    must be: ... to the Jew first and then to the Gentile. This is not because God prefers Jews over Gentiles, but because Jews were
    made by God to be His foundational kingdom of priests ( Exodus 19:3-6 )
    who must become spiritually capable to where they are able to support the
    "Priesthood of Believers" and bring God''s blessings to the Gentile nations of
    the world ( Genesis 22:16-18 ). This is the same principle of priestly
    preparation that we read about in Leviticus 16:3-6 , where Aaron the
    High Priest was required to perform a sacrifice for himself and his family
    before he could act as a priest for others on Yom Kippur .'

  commentary_rudolph: '"Grace", commonly defined as unmerited favor, is both an attribute and a gift
    that He imparts to us. But for what purpose and how are we to use it?
    Daniel Juster answers the question this way: Empowered by the Holy Spirit, we are to use our gifts and talents (from
    the Spirt) as instruments for the blessing and building up of fellow
    believers in order to reach others for the Good news. In a large sense then,
    grace is not only unmerited favor, but includes the idea of power to do
    things. Hence the grace gifts are gifts of power in that the grace of God
    changes us and gives us ability to live in a right manner and to bless
    others. One might ask what Scripture means when it says that Yeshua and Stephen were
    "full of grace and truth." The grace and truth that filled them was not
    intrinsically their own, but rather that which was placed in them by the
    Father to benefit others as the Holy Spirit directed. 1 We are to follow their example by being good Stewards of God''s grace and
    other spiritual gifts imparted to us as were they. 1. Although
    in Yeshua dwelt the fullness of God ( Colossians 1:19, 2:9) , Yeshua
    became a man like us ( Hebrews 2:14-17 ) and, like us, received his
    godly attributes (including grace and truth) from His Father in Heaven.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Generally, the statement of the Mitzvah speaks for itself, and the
    only controversy about it has to do with the administration of spankings. The
    well-known saying "spare the rod and spoil the child" is often mistakenly
    attributed to Scripture, but its origin is actually a
    17 th century poem by Samuel Butler titled
    "Hudibras", which has nothing to do with Scripture. Nevertheless, Proverbs 13:24 and Proverbs 22:15 speak similarly, and have
    been the subject of law suits and prosecutions promulgated by some in our
    society who believe that spanking a child for correction is cruel and
    abusive. In oppositional response to that, much has been written on how to
    administer a spanking with love that is truly corrective.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The term "Great Commission" does not appear in the text of the Bible. Its
    origin is unknown, but the term appears to have been popularized by Hudson
    Taylor (nineteenth century) to refer to Yeshua''s instruction to his original
    disciples (all Jews), to go to all nations and make the people from them into
    new disciples. They were instructed to immerse these new disciples into the
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teach them obedience to the commandments of
    God as taught by Yeshua. According to Matthew 28:16-20 and Mark 16:14-18 , Yeshua''s
    disciples were to preach to all the nations. Prior to that ( Matthew
    10:5-8 ), they were given similar instructions but to go only to the "lost
    sheep of the house of Israel." This and several other Scriptures indicate
    that, whereas the "Good News" brought by Yeshua was (and is) meant for all
    peoples, it was (and is) exceptionally important that it be preached first to
    the Jews because they have the primary covenantal responsibility of reaching
    the Gentile world for God. This covenantal responsibility was first
    proclaimed to Abraham ( Genesis 3:8-9 , 26:4 ), and was later
    re-proclaimed through Moses ( Exodus 19:5-6 ). The Great Commission cannot be accomplished without the power of the Holy
    Spirit. We read in John 14:15-26 of how, when Yeshua left the earth
    to be with his Father in heaven, the Father would send back the Holy Spirit.
    And in Acts 1:8 , we read that Yeshua''s disciples had to wait for power
    from the Holy Spirit before they could effectively be Yeshua''s witnesses.
    Finally (and consistent with that), we read in Matthew 10:5-8 and Mark 16:20 that the effectiveness of the disciples'' witness to the
    non-believing world was largely due to supernatural signs of power that were
    provided by the Holy Spirit. It is just as true for those of us who are
    Yeshua''s disciples today.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'There are some words in the Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah that
    are sufficiently similar as to warrant explanation. "Humility" and
    "humbleness" are the same, and refer to persons who do not elevate themselves
    in their own eyes. "Pride" is the opposite, in that a prideful person
    attributes self-value, abilities, qualities, and virtues to himself, whereas,
    even if they truly exist, they are not something he should be bragging about
    because they were given to him by God. "Haughtiness" and "arrogance" are
    similar, except that they refer to one''s outward manifestation of pride,
    whereas pride is largely internal. The reason that humility is lauded and pride is hated by God, is that pride
    is essentially a rejection of God, and is the sin that was behind Satan''s
    fall from grace. The sin of pride can manifest in several ways, the most
    obvious of which results in brash boasting. Motivating such a person is often
    the delusion that he is a "self-made man", forgetting or denying that God is
    the one who made him, and made him what he is. The opposite, humility, gives
    credit to God and also to others that have contributed to who we are, and
    what we have become. There is a more subtle way that pride can manifest. We sometimes come across
    it in a person that has a sour and complaining disposition, even bordering on
    self-deprecation. When we encounter it, we sometimes conclude that the
    person has a low opinion of his self-worth, whereas it is exactly the
    opposite. Instead of being boastful of his self-worth, such a person turns
    inward and resents that others do not adequately see it. "I deserved to get
    that job over my competitor" he might say to himself, or "they never give me
    credit for how valuable I really am." He may withdraw from social
    interactions by assuming in advance that he will be rejected, and may justify
    it by saying to himself something like: "I''m worth more than the way they
    treat me, so I won''t give them the benefit and pleasure of what I have to
    offer them." Perhaps I should not have to say this, but there is a way that we can
    experience pride that is not sinful. It is when pleasure is evoked in us by
    something of quality or by someone doing well, in which we have an interest.
    An example would be expressing pride in one''s son or daughter who is doing
    well in school, or in one''s hometown sports team that is winning most of its
    games. We need to be careful, however, because even such innocuous
    excursions into pride can cross the line of holy propriety if we begin
    thinking that our child''s or team''s successes are mainly due to us.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Because salt is essential for life, it is used in the Bible to symbolize
    life. Related to it, light is used in the Bible to symbolize godly knowledge
    and understanding that leads to life. Yeshua said of himself in John
    9:5 : While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. And yet, in Matthew 5:14 he told his disciples: You are light for the world. Could both be true? Yes, both were true, for he told his disciples in John 12:35 : The light will be with you only a little while longer. Walk while you have
    the light, or the dark will overtake you; he who walks in the dark doesn''t
    know where he''s going. Yeshua was letting his disciples know that he was going away, but that he was
    going to transfer his light to them so that when he left, his light would
    remain. The Bible uses "light" to symbolize revelation and understanding as
    far back as Genesis 1:3 and, in Isaiah 49:5-6 , Israel is said
    to be a "light to the Gentiles" (i.e. the rest of the world). Therefore, when
    Yeshua imparted his light to the original Jewish disciples (today all who
    believer in Yeshua are his disciples), he did so with the expectation that
    they/we would disseminate it throughout the world in his behalf. "Salt" is also used symbolically in the Bible. In addition to salt being an
    intrinsic part of our bodies and therefore necessary for life, it is used to
    preserve food and to make food flavorful. By Yeshua saying that we (his
    disciples) are to be salt for the earth, and by his warning to us not to lose
    our saltiness, he is sending us forth to minister the truth and life of God
    through both our words and through our "enlightened" examples that others who
    have need of knowing God would want to emulate.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 make it clear that Idolatry is
    broader than just worshiping physical idols and foreign gods. An idol is
    anything (or anyone) that we desire more strongly than we desire God, and
    idolatry is any giving-in to such a desire, and putting that thing or person
    ahead of God. Given that definition, what it means to practice idolatry or
    entice others to idolatry is clear but, what is not as clear is what it means
    to enable idolatry. That is more subtle and often goes unrecognized. We know
    that a family member is addicted to alcohol, yet we allow him to store liquor
    in the house. We have a listless son who will not work, yet we house him,
    feed him, and lend him our car. Consciously enabling another to commit sin
    (including idolatrous sin) makes us a participant, and as culpable as the one
    who actually commits it. The commandment in Deuteronomy 7:2 to kill the heathen and show no
    mercy was given in the context of Israel first entering the promised land and
    God delivering the heathen of the land into their hands for destruction. Even
    today, we should show limited mercy to the opponents of God if the mercy will
    further their idolatry. To give a trivial opinion example, if a person drops
    a stack of pamphlets that teach unbiblical practices, we should not assist
    him in gathering them up. We cannot apply the Scripture to justify destroying
    all heathens in these New Covenant times because that would be in violation
    of Leviticus 19:18 and Matthew 22:39 , which require that we
    love our neighbor, in violation of Matthew 5:44 , which commands us to
    love our enemies, and in violation of 1 Peter 2:13-14 , which commands
    us to submit to human authorities. To destroy all idolaters today would also
    be contrary to our New Covenant commission to carry God''s Word to the sinners
    of the world ( Mark 16:15 ; Luke 15:10 ; Romans 5:8 ; 1
    Timothy 1:15 ). Now a word about Exodus 23:33 that prohibits us from allowing
    idolaters to dwell in our land lest their sin be a snare for us. As
    individuals, we cannot control what is allowed in the Land of Israel, but we
    do have control over who we allow to live in our houses and congregations.
    This is not to say that we should not invite idolatrous sinners into our
    dwelling places as guests for a time, for how else can we minister the Word
    of God to them? Still, such persons should not be invited for an extended
    period of time, or allowed to share occupancy with us as co-owners or
    co-tenants.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Hebrew of Leviticus 23:23:24 says that the first day of the
    seventh month ( Tishrei on the lunar calendar) is a remembrance of
    blowing ( Zich''ron T''ruah ), and Numbers 29:1 says it is a day of
    blowing ( Yom T''ruah ); the CJB translation adds the word
    " shofar " (a trumpet made from an animal horn) because that was
    what was customarily blown in Moses'' time to draw the community''s attention,
    to summon to assembly, and to sound alarms. That is why the first day of Tishrei is sometimes referred to as the "Day of Trumpets" ( Yom
    HaShofar ), and it is a warning to prepare for the Day of Atonement
    ( Yom Kippur ) that is about to come. It is generally understood that
    not everyone in the community need blow a shofar ; it is sufficient
    that the community cause the shofar to be blown in public for all to
    hear. In the Jewish world, Yom T''ruah is most commonly known as Rosh HaShanah (Head of the Year), and considered the "Day of Judgment"
    ( Yom HaDin ) when the "Books of Life" are opened, and we are called to
    begin an examination of our lives, with the purpose of repenting of our sins
    before the "Books" are again closed and sealed, ten days later, on the "Day
    of Atonement" ( Yom Kippur ). The day is also said, in Talmud ,
    to be the anniversary of the creation of the world. Scripture does not indicate the reason for Yom T''ruah , but its
    placement 10 days prior to Yom Kippur strongly suggests that it is
    intended to begin a count-down of days for personal introspection leading to Yom Kippur . This theme is reflected in Mishna Yoma 1 and its related Talmudic Gemara , that explain how the High Priest
    ( Kohen HaGadol ) was sequestered for purification seven days prior to Yom Kippur ; that process would have begun three days from when the shofar sounded on Yom T''ruah . This time of introspection from Yom T''ruah to Yom Kippur (known
    as the "Days of Awe" or Yamim Nora''iym ) should be seen as meaningful
    to all Jews and all followers of Yeshua because, according to Exodus
    19:6 , Israel is a kingdom of priests (albeit not all of Israel are
    Levitical priests) and, according to 1 Peter 2:9 and Revelation
    5:10 , all New Covenant believers have been made priests as well.
    Priestly duties require time spent for personal cleansing, so what better use
    is there of the ten day period from when the trumpets sound to Yom
    Kippur ? That notwithstanding, literal compliance with this Mitzvah , i.e., to blow the shofar , is mandatory only for Jews
    and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. It is optional for Gentiles generally. It is an interesting side-note that the Babylonian Talmud ( b.
    Rosh HaShanah 29b ) prohibits the shofar from being blown when Rosh HaShanah falls on a weekly Shabbat. The reason given for this
    prohibition is to protect the Shabbat from being violated by someone
    who might inadvertently carry his shofar beyond the prescribed distance. My
    position is that the Talmudic prohibition is incorrect because it is
    in direct contradiction of several Scriptures that require that the shofar be
    blown on Yom T''ruah (which, by the way, is itself a Shabbat ). We have said much about blowing the shofar on Yom T''ruah , but
    Scripture commands that the shofar be blown at other times as well,
    such as on the other appointed days, on Rosh Chodesh , on days of
    rejoicing, and as an alarm to war. In this last-mentioned time of blowing we
    should not limit our understanding of war to just the physical, but also to
    times of spiritual warfare, especially when declared by our communities''
    leaders. We are also to blow the shofar on days of rejoicing, and the
    contrast of war and rejoicing is something to consider as we ponder complying
    with 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 : Always be joyful. Pray regularly. In everything give thanks, for this is
    what God wants from you who are united with the Messiah Yeshua.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures are plain in commanding that we are not to enter into
    covenants with idolaters and unbelievers in God, Yeshua, or the Bible. The
    kinds of covenants prohibited are not trivial agreements, but rather the kind
    that yoke individuals in causes for which the covenanting parties''
    understanding of God, morality, and ethics is material. Likewise, the kinds
    of idolaters contemplated are not those with minor personal bondages, but
    rather those whose idolatries render them unbelievers or persons whose
    judgments are likely to adversely affect the covenants into which they enter.
    The result of a believer entering into covenant with such a person can be
    isastrous because a believer''s basis for conduct is God''s Law, whereas an
    unbeliever recognizes no such authority. The prohibition of this Mitzvah does not usually apply to contracts
    such as those to buy or sell a described item at a defined price, because the
    terms of such agreements are not vague and are usually not dependent on the
    moral and ethical values of the parties. On the other hand, partnerships of
    most kinds (especially marriage) by believers and unbelievers are prohibited
    because, in the course of continuously dealing with one another, partners
    must be biblically in accord in handling situations as they arise. In cases
    of unequal yoking, the covenanting parties hold different values and respond
    to different authorities for their conduct; the result is that, sooner or
    later, they will either dissolve their covenant and part ways, or the
    believing party will be persuaded by the unbelieving party to compromise his
    or her biblical principles. Many a marriage and business partnership has
    been shattered through unequal yoking.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah historically applies to having reverence for the
    Tabernacle of God and later for the Temple, for these were, according to
    Scripture, most holy. Today, we may apply this Mitzvah to any
    biblically authorized sanctuary in which God dwells or in which we worship
    Him. This includes edifices such as synagogues, churches and chapels, and
    may be extended to their furnishings and accoutrements that are set aside as
    holy objects used in worship. We must treat even the space of these
    sanctuaries with respect and not conduct ourselves in ways that demean their
    purpose. Some synagogue and church sanctuaries are temporary or convertible spaces
    that are used for other things besides worship. In such cases, the space
    ought to be ceremonially commissioned when it is about to be used as a
    sanctuary, and decommissioned, and its holy objects put away, when its use as
    a sanctuary is concluded. The 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 Scripture is interesting in that it applies
    to our personal bodies and also to our corporate body, the body of believers.
    Having reverence for these bodies is not very different from how we are to
    treat sanctuaries of brick and mortar, in that we are to care for them and
    not subject them to, or use them for, unholy purposes.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Clinging to God means that we are to tenaciously grab hold of Him and not let
    go. We are to derive our strength from God, trust Him, and allow nothing to
    separate us from Him or entice us away from Him. This becomes most
    meaningful during times when we are tempted us to abandon God and follow the
    path of self or sin. James 4:7-8a teaches that, during such times, we
    must submit to God. Moreover, take a stand against the Adversary, and he will
    flee from you [us]. Come close to God, and he will come close to you
    [us]. We do this by remembering God''s Word in 2 Timothy 2:26 : that [we] may come to [our] senses and escape the snare of the devil,
    having been taken captive by him to do his will. Yeshua addresses this in Matthew 6:13a , in the prayer he recommends to
    His disciples: And do not lead us into hard testing, but keep us safe from the Evil
    One.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Although historically commanded to Israelites concerning lending money to
    (and taking security from) other Israelites, compassion suggests that this Mitzvah be applied to everyone. It in fact raises the question of
    whether it is proper, in the first place, to take possession of any pledged
    object which is likely to be needed in the future. In modern times, it is unlikely that a person who is not in the pawn business
    will take security of chattel for a loan, and it is even less likely that
    chattel security would involve clothing. Yet, there might be a moral analogy
    if one takes possession of an item such as a person''s tools if the tools are
    needed by him to earn a living.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah presents Scriptures supporting the statement: "We are to
    appoint elders in our communities to lead, pray, judge, teach, & make halachah ." The Scriptures on appointing, leading, praying, and
    teaching are self-explanatory, so this commentary is limited to discussing
    the role of elders making halachah . Halachot are rules that have the force of law in a Jewish community.
    Elders of a Messianic Jewish congregational (or network of congregations)
    community can declare halachah (law) for their congregation or network
    if their community acknowledges that they have been given the authority to do
    so by Scripture. Examples of common halachic rules for congregations
    are (a) membership in the congregation requires tithing; (b) membership in
    the congregation requires attendance at services; (c) pork products are not
    allowed to be served at congregational meals; and (d) men that assist in a Shabbat Torah service must wear a tallit gadol . During the Mosaic era, elders were appointed to sit at the gates of the
    Israelites'' cities and judge cases that were brought to them (e.g. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 ; Ruth 4:1-2 ). With one exception, the
    cases decided by elders that we read about in the Bible are those in which a
    person lodges a complaint against another person. The exception, the one in
    which halachah is made, is Acts 15:1-31 . In that Scripture,
    elders and apostles gathered in Jerusalem to consider and rule upon how much
    of Torah (Mosaic Law) is required of the Gentiles. It is an inescapable necessity that elders of a community interpret God''s Law
    (both Mosaic and New Covenant) for their respective communities, and make
    decisions as to the Law''s application. If they do not, the practices of
    individuals and families within each community will be out of step with one
    another, confusion will result, and the community will not be able to
    function. Here is a Scripture from the Mosaic era that will illustrate my
    point; it is the familiar commandment to keep the Shabbat: Exodus 20:8-10 : Remember the day, Shabbat, to set it apart for God. You have six days to
    labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Shabbat for ADONAI your
    God. On it, you are not to do any kind of work - not you, your son or your
    daughter, not your male or female slave, not your livestock, and not the
    foreigner staying with you inside the gates to your property. But, what constitutes work? Continuing in one''s income-producing occupation
    is obviously the kind of work that is prohibited by the Scripture, but what
    about an elderly or disabled person walking three miles to a synagogue? That
    is obviously hard work for them, so is it allowed? If the elders of the
    synagogue community determine that it is, or is not, and make their ruling a
    standard for that community, they are making halachah , and such
    decisions are absolutely necessary for a community of individuals to be able
    to function together. There are hundreds if not thousands of such examples, but I will present just
    one more for clarity; referring to the Feast of Unleavened bread, we read: Exodus 12:15 For seven days you are to eat matzah - on the first day remove the leaven
    from your houses. For whoever eats hametz [leavened bread] from the first to
    the seventh day is to be cut off from Isra''el. But what does it mean to eat matzah for seven days? Does it mean to
    eat it every day for seven days, or does it only mean to not eat leavened
    bread for seven days? And what constitutes chametz ? Clearly, bread
    risen with yeast is chametz , but is it also other foods that have
    yeast in them? And if we let a piece of matzah be exposed to the air
    long enough for yeast spores from the air to fall on it, does the matzah become chametz and therefore unacceptable to be eaten
    during Pesach and the week following? These are the kinds of decisions
    that are best made by the Jewish community in which we live, and when the
    elders of our community declare the answers to these and similar questions,
    they are making halachah for their community. The concept of halachah is not the same in the Messianic Jewish
    community as in the wider Jewish community. In the wider Jewish community, halachah is inextricably connected to certain ancient rabbis whose
    rulings on Mosaic Law (both written and oral) are recorded in the Talmud . Responsa are modern (and not-so-modern) era decisions
    and rulings made by respected Jewish scholars in response to questions of
    Jewish law put to them - also involving the written and (what they consider)
    oral Mosaic law. Messianic Jewish halachah , however, is fundamentally
    different in that it does not acknowledge an oral Torah , and looks to
    the Scriptures (Old and New Testaments) as the only divine authority. It
    does, from time to time, consider teachings in the Talmud - not for
    their authority, but for information about what is considered to be Jewish in
    the wider Jewish community, and occasionally for interpretive wisdom and
    cultural application. There is another way in which Messianic and "wider-Jewish-world" halachah are different, and that is that Messianic Judaism seeks God''s
    interpretation of His Law, whereas Orthodox Judaism believes that it has the
    authority to interpret it themselves and even change God''s Torah ; the
    origin of this belief can be found in TB Bava Metziah 59b , in
    which one translation
    states: 1 It has been taught: On that day R. Eliezer brought forward every imaginable
    argument, but they did not accept them. Said he to them: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let this carob-tree prove it!'' Thereupon the
    carob-tree was torn a hundred cubits out of its place - others affirm, four
    hundred cubits. ''No proof can be brought from a carob-tree,'' they retorted.
    Again he said to them: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let the stream
    of water prove it!'' Whereupon the stream of water flowed backwards - ''No
    proof can be brought from a stream of water,'' they rejoined. Again he urged:
    ''If the halachah agrees with me, let the walls of the schoolhouse
    prove it,'' whereupon the walls inclined to fall. But R. Joshua rebuked them,
    saying: ''When scholars are engaged in a halachic dispute, what have ye
    to interfere?'' Hence they did not fall, in honor of R. Joshua, nor did they
    resume the upright, in honor of R. Eliezer; and they are still standing thus
    inclined. Again he said to them: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let
    it be proved from Heaven!'' Whereupon a Heavenly Voice cried out: ''Why do ye
    dispute with R. Eliezer, seeing that in all matters the halachah agrees with him!'' But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: ''It is not in heaven.''
    What did he mean by this? - Said R. Jeremiah: That the Torah had
    already been given at Mount Sinai; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice,
    because Thou hast long since written in the Torah at Mount Sinai,
    After the majority must one incline. The Mitzvot presented in this book are my and Dr. Juster''s offered
    suggestions for Messianic Jewish (New Covenant) halachah , but can only
    become halachah if and when they are received as such by a Messianic
    Jewish community. 1. Online Soncino Babylonian Talmud Translation, Rabbi

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures quoted herein prohibit the ancient Israelites and later New
    Covenant believers from adopting the customs and practices of heathens.
    Typical of these practices are eating blood, fortune-telling, practicing
    divination, rounding one''s hair, cutting the edge of one''s beard, tattooing
    or cutting one''s flesh, wearing heathen-style of clothing, wearing garments
    of the opposite sex, worshiping idols, practicing debauchery, becoming drunk,
    and participating in wild parties and orgies. Of special interest are Deuteronomy 12:2-4 and Deuteronomy
    12:29-31 that enumerate ways in which heathens served their gods, and
    forbid Israelites from serving the one true God in similar ways. These two
    Scriptures have been the source of much debate as to whether customs and
    practices that were once used in idolatrous ways but are no longer used in
    those ways can be redeemed. Can a church not have a steeple because ancient
    heathen temples most probably had pointed roofs? Can we not light candles on Shabbat because the ancient heathen used candles and torches as part
    of their idolatrous worship? My opinion is that some such things can be used
    and some cannot, and we need to consult the Holy Spirit to know which are
    which. 1 Other Scriptures that are related to this Mitzvah are those that
    prohibit wearing clothing made of wool and linen, and clothing of the
    opposite sex. I see them as related. Deuteronomy 22:9-11 prohibits our
    sowing two different kinds of seeds, plowing with two kinds of animals, and
    wear clothing made of two kinds of thread (wool and Linen). Leviticus
    19:19 prohibits our mating two kinds of animals, sowing two kinds of
    grain, and wearing clothing made of two kinds of ( shatneiz ), which means "stuff". Deuteronomy 22:5 prohibits
    our wearing clothing of the opposite sex, which presumably means mixing two
    kinds of clothing - those of our own sex, and those of the opposite sex. The
    theme that is common to all of these is mixing things that do not naturally
    go together, and reminds one of 2 Corinthians 6:14 that states: Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers. For how can
    righteousness and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have
    with darkness? Mixing things that do not belong together was (and still is) a perverted
    heathen practice (for example, mixing temple worship with prostitution), and
    we are prohibited from adopting heathen practices as our own. 1. In view of this prohibition, one might consider the
    inappropriateness of Christians adopting heathen practices such as
    displaying images of deceased persons, erecting Christmas trees, and
    coloring Easter eggs.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The words "prostitutes" and "whore" are both found in the Bible, and are
    similar. A "whore" is a sexually loose woman, and a "prostitute" is a whore
    who sells her sexual favors for a price. Used in this way they are nouns,
    but both words can also be used as verbs. When they are used as verbs (e.g.
    to "whore" or to "prositute" one''s self) they are often not referring to
    sexual activity but rather to giving or selling oneself against
    society''s acceptable norms or God''s will (e.g. prostititing onself to
    the heathen gods). Whereas classically, the Mitzvah prohibiting prostitution alludes only
    to a man paying a woman to have sexual intercourse, this Mitzvah includes the wider prohibition mentioed above, which is most often
    exemplified by Israel selling herself through its sinful conduct. That is
    why the statement of this Mitzvah is "We are not to participate in
    prostitution of any kind or in any way ." Prostitution, by definition, has to have a price of sale, so what might men''s
    (or women''s) price or gain be for prostituting themselves? It varies from
    time to time, but it has typically been power, safety, economic advantage, or
    social acceptance. Here are some Scriptures that speak directly to the point without using the
    word "prostitute". It is subtle but, in each case, the prostituting offender
    gives something of himself in order to get something or achieve something in
    return. Proverbs 29:26 : Many seek the ruler''s favor, but it is from ADONAI that each gets
    justice . John 12:42-43 : Nevertheless, many of the leaders did trust in him; but because of the
    P''rushim they did not say so openly, out of fear of being banned from
    the synagogue; for they loved praise from other people more than praise from
    God . Galatians 1:10 : Now does that sound as if I were trying to win human approval? No! I want
    God''s approval! Or that I''m trying to cater to people? If I were
    still doing that, I would not be a servant of the Messiah . Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch wrote two mitzvot each that allude to
    prostitution. One of thtem relies on Leviticus 19:29 that prohibits
    making one''s daughter into a prostitute, but they express their mitzvot as not having sex outside of marriage. The other mitzvah that each wrote relies on Deuteronomy 23:19(18) and
    commands against bringing the financial fruits of prostitution into the
    Temple as an offering to the Lord. NCLA :

  commentary_rudolph: 'This ceremony (that we now call a seder ) was commanded for us
    (Israelites) to do after we emerged from Egypt and entered the Land that the
    Lord had promised our ancestors. Although Israel''s exodus from Egypt
    occurred many centuries ago, we retell its events in the first person as
    though "we" (not "they") left Egypt. I believe it is also applicable to
    Gentiles who permanently live within the Jewish community ( K''rovei
    Yisrael ) because those whom God brought out of Egypt were a mixed
    multitude that consisted, not of Jews only, but also of Gentiles ( Exodus
    12:38 ). At our modern Passover seder , it is customary for a child to ask four
    questions, and for us to answer the questions by telling him (or her) the
    story of when we left Egypt. Through this retelling, we are reminded of
    God''s miracles in our behalf, that He brought us out of Egypt "by the
    strength of His hand", and that we left in such haste that we brought no
    leaven with us so the bread we had to eat was un-risen. Although our living
    conditions in the desert were strenuous, God provided for us with manna 1 ,
    quail, water, and shoes that did not wear out. His greatest provision for
    us, however, was His divine presence, for He accompanied us and guided us
    through the desert in a column of cloud by day and a column of fire by night. While this Mitzvah to recount Israel''s exodus from Egypt is clearly
    directed to Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles, the remembrance of what
    God did for Israel should be a joy and encouragement for all believers. All
    Gentile parents who are believers may therefore want to tell the story of the
    Exodus, and explain about matzah , leaven, and chametz to their
    children as well. 1. A flaky sweet-tasting bread sent from heaven -

  commentary_rudolph: 'I believe the two reasons given in Numbers 9:10 for delaying Passover
    observance are not the only two intended, but are rather meant to suggest
    others as well that are equally valid. For example, if a Jewish man or woman
    cannot observe Passover on the 14 th of Nisan due to illness, he or she must earnestly seek to do so a month later on the
    14 th of Iyar . I consider this mitzvah mandatory for individual Jews and for K''rov
    Yisrael Gentiles who find themselves in the position of not being able to
    fulfill their Passover observance obligation on the
    14 th of Nisan . Other Gentiles, however,
    should they undertake this Mitzvah would, in my opinion be wrongly
    stating that meticulous Passover observance is an obligation as to them.
    For that reason, I consider literal compliance of this Mitzvah to be
    unauthorized and not recommended for Gentiles who are not K''rovei

  commentary_rudolph: 'Stealing is taking from someone, that to which the taker has no right. One
    who steals is called a thief. Robbery is similar in that there is an
    unlawful taking, but it is more severe in that the taking is by force. One
    who commits robbery is called a robber. The prohibition against stealing is
    one of the Ten Commandments; stealing and committing robbery are dealt with
    in separate Scriptures. One might ask why Psalm 62:11(10) calls extortion robbery, since there
    is no apparent force employed. The answer is that the kind of force which
    elevates stealing to robbery does not have to be physical force. Coercion
    and threats are a form of force, in that they achieve their end by evoking
    fear. It is similar with Leviticus 19:13 , which calls delaying the
    payment of wages not only theft, but robbery. That is because the employer,
    in delaying payment to his worker, improperly exercises coercive power he has
    over his worker - a form of force. Stealing and robbery are not only technical sins, but are also moral ones in
    that the perpetrator is willing to harm another individual. This intentional
    causing of harm to another automatically violates Leviticus 19:18 : ... love your neighbor as yourself ... as well as a plethora of other Scriptures commanding that we love (and
    therefore not harm) others. If one is caught stealing, he must pay restitution and, under certain
    circumstances, must pay several times the restitution. The higher goal,
    however, is for the thief or robber to experience a heart-change and be moved
    to repentance even if he is not caught. Zakkai the tax collector is an
    example of such a man when, touched by the Spirit in Luke 19:8 , blurts
    out to Yeshua: Here, Lord, I am giving half of all I own to the poor; and if I have
    cheated anyone, I will pay him back four times as much. Yeshua responds
    in verse 9 : Today salvation has come to this house, inasmuch as
    this man too is a son of Avraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and save
    what was lost. This same need for heartfelt repentance is expressed in Ephesians 4:28 which instructs the thief to stop stealing and, instead, to earn honest money
    that he can "share with those in need". A noted writer Jay E. Adams asks
    rhetorically: "When is a thief not a thief? When he stops
    stealing?" 1 Then he answers his own question: "No, if the only thing a thief has done is
    to stop stealing, he remains a thief who, at the moment, is not stealing."
    Adams goes on to explain that it takes a repentant change of heart for a
    thief to become an honest man; only then is he no longer a thief. 1. Jay E. Adams, "The Christian Counselor''s

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Ru''ach Hakodesh is so often identified with the New Covenant, that
    the Spirit''s ministry going back to the creation is often overlooked. It is
    absolutely essential that we not oppose the Ru''ach Hakodesh in any
    manner because He is our relational and communication link to the Father and
    to Yeshua. Theologians debate the meaning of blaspheming the Holy Spirit, the
    one and only act that Scripture tells us is unforgiveable. Whatever it is, it
    cannot be easy to do, and if we are the least concerned about it, that alone
    is strong evidence that the Holy Spirit has not left us. The benefit of the New Covenant over the Mosaic Covenant (other than Yeshua''s
    sacrifice for our sins) is largely the ministry of the Holy Spirit and His
    willingness to dwell within us. In 1 Corinthians 6:19 the Shaliach Paul asks: ... don''t you know that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who
    lives inside you, whom you received from God? It is therefore absolutely essential that we do nothing to grieve or oppose
    the Holy Spirit in any manner. The Holy Spirit not only speaks to us
    individually, but He is also able to speak to us for others - sometimes in a
    language that we understand, and sometimes in a language that we do not
    understand unless we or someone else is able to interpret. We call the latter
    kind of language "tongues", and the Shaliach Paul is emphatic that we
    must not forbid prophesying in tongues (albeit it must be done in a right
    order, and with interpretation). Can we sin to a degree that God withdraws His Holy Spirit from us? The two
    examples provided above ( 1 Samuel 16:14 and Psalms 51:11 )
    occurred prior to the New Covenant; David was worried about losing the Holy
    Spirit, and Saul actually did. In the New Covenant, we have Matthew
    12:30-32 and Mark 3:28-29 that tell us that blaspheming the Holy
    Spirit is unforgiveable and results in an eternal sin. Scripture does not say
    that that involves loss of the Holy Spirit, but it certainly seems as though
    it does.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Blasphemy is communicating disrespect for something that is sacred or someone
    who is holy. Among believers, we often hear doctrinal statements espoused
    as though they have nothing or little to do with each other. For example: Blaspheming God is a forgivable sin, whereas blaspheming the Holy
    Spirit is an unpardonable sin ( Leviticus 24:15-16 ; Matthew
    12:32 ). If we believe in our heart and confess with our mouth that Yeshua was
    raised from the dead we will be saved ( Romans 10:8-9 ). It is necessary that we receive the Holy Spirit in order to receive
    power and spiritual gifts from on high ( Acts 1:8 ; 1 Corinthians
    14:1 ). These sayings are correct, but have we sufficiently considered how they are
    related to each other, and why they are correct in view of their raising
    perplexing questions? For example, statement #1 raises the question: "Why is
    blaspheming the Holy Spirit unforgivable, whereas blaspheming Yeshua or the
    Father forgivable?" And as to statement #2: "What is special about believing
    in Yeshua as compared to God the Father and the Holy Spirit? Is it not
    sufficient to believe in God broadly? After all, there are those in the
    world that have never heard of Yeshua." And a question that may arise
    regarding statement #3 is: "Why does God single out the Holy Spirit as the
    conveyer of His power and gifts? Can we not receive God''s power and gifts
    directly from the Father and Yeshua without the Holy Spirit''s intervention?" The answers to these questions become clearer when we stop thinking of
    biblical doctrines such as these as standing on their own, and begin to
    appreciate them as interrelated. As a matter of fact, despite the prominence
    given in some quarter to sayings #1, #2, and #3, none of them are primary.
    What is primary and the umbrella for all of them is what is known as the
    " Sh''ma " - Deuteronomy 6:4-6 as explained by Yeshua in Matthew 22:34-40 : ... but when the P''rushim learned that he had silenced the Tz''dukim, they
    got together, and one of them who was a Torah expert asked a sh''eilah to trap
    him: "Rabbi, which of the mitzvot in the Torah is the most important?" He
    told him, "''You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all
    your soul and with all your strength.'' This is the greatest and most
    important mitzvah. And a second is similar to it, ''You are to love your
    neighbor as yourself.'' All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on
    these two mitzvot." We cannot love God with all of our heart, soul and strength unless we know
    Him intimately, and we cannot know Him intimately unless God reveals Yeshua
    to us through the Holy Spirit ( John 6:44 ). We cannot know Him by our
    own knowledge and virtue - even by the Words of Scripture if the Holy Spirit
    does not first soften our hearts and give us understanding ( Ephesians
    2:8-9 ). Then, once God and His nature are revealed to us, we have the
    choice of whether or not to receive Him. If we do, the Holy Spirit takes up
    residence in us, we are given a new spirit, our hearts become softened, and
    we become open to more of God. If we do not, we keep our old spirit, our
    hearts become hardened, and God becomes more distant to us over time. But you say: "How do sayings #1, #2, and #3 fit into this? What about #1 for
    example? What about trusting in Yeshua to be saved?" Consider the totality
    of what John 3:14-18 says: Just as Moshe lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man
    be lifted up; so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life. For
    God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone
    who trusts in him [some translations say "believes in Him"] may have
    eternal life, instead of being utterly destroyed. For God did not send the
    Son into the world to judge the world, but rather so that through him, the
    world might be saved. Those who trust in him are not judged; those who do
    not trust have been judged already, in that they have not trusted in the one
    who is God''s only and unique Son. For anyone to believe and trust in Yeshua we must be brought to that belief
    and trust by the Holy Spirit, i.e. by God Himself who draws us near through
    the Holy Spirit ( John 6:44 ). Man cannot perceive the invisible God by
    his natural senses so, without the Holy Spirit, there is no natural way to
    know Him, and therefore no reason to believe in Him since we (presumably) do
    not believe what the Bible says of Him either. So, the Holy Spirit is needed in order for statement #1 above to be true. And
    the Holy Spirit is likewise needed for statement #2 but, as valuable as
    receiving power and spiritual gifts are, they are not as primary as knowing
    God for Who He Is; that knowledge can only be brought to us by the Holy
    Spirit. As for statement #3, if we blaspheme and therefore reject the Holy
    Spirit, we cannot be brought to the place of knowing either God the son or
    God the Father, and we therefore cannot be saved. On the other hand, if we
    blaspheme the Father or Yeshua (sinful to be sure) but do not reject the Holy
    Spirit, the Holy Spirit can eventually lead us to repentance and salvation.
    That is why Scripture refers to blaspheming the Holy Spirit (and not the
    Father nor the Son) as an eternal
    sin. 1 Thus far, I have spoken of receiving Messiah and the Holy Spirit and of their
    respective ministries, but Scripture also speaks of an "immersion" or
    "baptism" ( Matthew 3:11 ), and a "filling" ( Ephesians 5:18 ) of
    the Holy Spirit as well. I believe that they are essentially the same, but
    perhaps the baptism is an initial filling. Apparently, the Holy Spirit is
    like a fluid, and we can have more of less of Him depending upon our
    willingness to receive Him, and our repentant condition. We can have a
    minimal amount of Him - just enough to bring us to the place of salvation,
    and we can also be filled with Him, the result being that He can give us
    spiritual power and spiritual gifts ( 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 ).
    Oppositely, we can lose a portion of the Holy Spirit (drip-by-drip) as a
    result of sin, and can be re-filled with the Holy Spirit if and when we
    repent ( Ephesians 5:18 ). This Mitzvah and its accompanying Scriptures clearly show that the
    triune persons of God work together, and that the Holy Spirit, along with
    Messiah, is key to our relationship with God and to our salvation. 1. I do not believe that Scripture teaches that a momentary
    blasphemous remark against the Holy Spirit leads to eternal unforgiveness.
    I believe that Stern translates Matthew 12:32 correctly in saying:
    " ... but whoever keeps on speaking against the Ruach HaKodesh will never
    be forgiven ... "'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Swearing, in the context of this mitzvah , is invoking the Name of God
    in order to add a weight of truth to that which is spoken. Swearing can be
    formal (such as in a court of law), in which case swearing falsely is known
    as "perjury", and one can be punished by the court for committing it.
    Swearing can also be informal such as when one makes a comment on the spur of
    the moment and adds an oath to the comment as a way of attempting to assure
    its truth. In either case, the Scriptures that underlay this Mitzvah make it clear that one must never swear to that which is untrue.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Adultery is sexual intimacy between a married person and a person who is not
    his or her spouse. The Scriptures on adultery in the Tanakh refer
    only to physical intimacy, but it is broader than that in the New Covenant,
    and even includes lusting after someone of the opposite sex, and divorcing
    without biblical grounds ( Matthew 5:27-28 ). Adultery is also mentioned in the New Covenant Scriptures as (arguably) the
    only reason that one may divorce a spouse (Some include abandonment and cite 1 Corinthians 7:15 ). The Scriptures usually quoted to support this
    are Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9 , which speak of fornication
    and sexual immorality; fornication during marriage is adultery. Adultery is one of the foundational prohibitions in the Bible because it
    negates the marital covenant of two becoming one ( Genesis 2:24 ; Matthew 19:4-5 ; Mark 10:7-8 ; and Ephesians 5:31 ). Not
    often discussed, however, is verse 32 that follows Ephesians
    5:31 : There is profound truth hidden here, which I say concerns the Messiah and
    the Messianic Community. Some translations call it a profound mystery, so what might the mystery be?
    I believe that it refers to a husband-wife relationship that exists between
    Messiah and the Messianic Community, 1 a relationship within which adultery can be committed in the same way as
    with married couples. 1. Variously called the
    "Commonwealth of Israel", the "Body of Believers", and the "Church". Let''s see how that can happen; Yeshua is described as a "bridegroom" several
    times in Scripture: Mark 2:18-20 : Also Yochanan''s talmidim and the P''rushim were fasting; and they came and
    asked Yeshua, "Why is it that Yochanan''s talmidim and the talmidim of the
    P''rushim fast, but your talmidim don''t fast?" Yeshua answered them, "Can
    wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they
    have the bridegroom with them, fasting is out of the question. But the time
    will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; and when that day
    comes, they will fast." John 3:28-29 : You yourselves can confirm that I did not say I was the Messiah, but that
    I have been sent ahead of him. The bridegroom is the one who has the bride;
    but the bridegroom''s friend, who stands and listens to him, is overjoyed at
    the sound of the bridegroom''s voice. So this joy of mine is now complete. Although the "bride" is only referenced in John 3:29 , her identity can
    be inferred from other Scriptures that speak of the "bridegroom" (a
    bridegroom has a bride) and also from Ephesians 5:22-24 : Wives should submit to their husbands as they do to the Lord; because the
    husband is head of the wife, just as the Messiah, as head of the Messianic
    Community, is himself the one who keeps the body safe. Just as the Messianic
    Community submits to the Messiah, so also wives should submit to their
    husbands in everything. This Scripture makes it clear that, by analogy, the Messiah is "husband" to
    the "Messianic Community" that is the "wife". Saying it another way, Yeshua
    is "bridegroom" to the "Commonwealth of Israel" who is the "bride" so, also
    by analogy, whenever a member of the bride (the Commonwealth of Israel) sins
    against Yeshua (the bridegroom) by pursuing the ways of other gods (sin), he
    or she commits adultery. Historically, states of the United States made adultery a crime by statute
    but, to the best of my knowledge, that is no longer the case. It is,
    however, prosecuted under the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice that
    prohibits conduct likely to bring discredit upon the armed forces, or conduct
    that is prejudicial to good order and discipline. Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch describe adultery as having sexual relations
    with another man''s wife, and do not consider that adultery occurs when a
    married man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman. Also, they define
    "adultery" in the usual way of limiting it to physical intercourse. NCLA :

  commentary_rudolph: 'Most of the mitzvot promulgated in the Mosaic era appear to command
    against worshiping foreign gods of the supernatural kind - sometimes
    attributed to animals and natural objects (e.g. the Nile river god and the
    frog god of the Egyptians), and sometimes man-made objects (e.g. heathen
    carved statues and the golden calf). While not spoken of directly in the
    Mosaic Law, Satan and satanic influence is at the core of all idolatry and of
    all gods other than the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It was the
    archangel Lucifer (later named Satan) who first rebelled against God, and who
    was cast out of heaven and allowed to become the god of the earth to the
    extent that man would allow him. Satan''s first attempt at seducing man away
    from God was successful (i.e. Adam and Eve), and the rest of the earth''s
    history has been his war against God for the heart of mankind. There were (and still are) pagans who were/are susceptible to worshiping
    foreign gods, such as the Canaanites and Egyptians of old, and the Hindus and
    Satanists of today. The religions of the Canaanites and Egyptians severely
    impacted the Israelites in years gone by but, today, Satan''s attack on God''s
    people is more subtle. We get a hint of the kinds of idols that impact us
    most today from the following Scriptures: 1 Samuel 15:23: For rebellion is like the sin of sorcery, stubbornness like the crime of
    idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of ADONAI, he too has rejected
    you as king. Ephesians 5:5: For of this you can be sure: every sexually immoral, impure or greedy
    person - that is, every idol-worshipper - has no share in the Kingdom of the
    Messiah and of God. Colossians 3:5: Therefore, put to death the earthly parts of your nature - sexual
    immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed (which is a form of
    idolatry) 1 Timothy 6:10: For the love of money is a root of all the evils; because of this craving,
    some people have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves to the
    heart with many pains. These Scriptures indicate that stubbornness, sexual immorality, impurity,
    lust, evil desires and greed for money and property are all idols. Other
    common idols are money, property, power, and security. An idol is therefore
    anything (or anyone) that we desire more strongly than we desire God, and
    idolatry is any giving-in to such a desire, such that we put that thing or
    person ahead of God. This Mitzvah commands us to put away all
    idolatry, both the worship of foreign gods, as well as those other idols that
    draw us away from the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Anyone who allows
    such things to dominate his or her life is guilty of idolatry.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is recited by Jews the world over several times a day in
    a portion of the Torah known as the " Sh''ma " ( Deuteronomy
    6:4-9 ). It is so foundational to Jewish faith, that when Yeshua was
    asked in Matthew 22:36 , " Rabbi, which of the mitzvot in the Torah
    is the most important? " he replied by quoting Deuteronomy 6:5 :
    " ''You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all your
    soul and with all your strength'' " (see also Mark 12:30 and Luke
    10:27 ). Loving God is a covenant commitment to Him that is proven though our
    obedience ( John 14:21-24 ) and our willingness and sincere desire to
    put His agenda before our own ( Matthew 6:33, 16:24-25 ; Luke
    9:23 ). That notwithstanding, love (including love of God) has an
    emotional component to it, a passion, that must be guided by that covenant
    commitment; the two go together. Also, perceiving God''s nature, character,
    majesty, and faithfulness, causes us to recognize His love of us, and
    stimulates our love of Him in return ( 1 John 4:19 ). Loving God is also connected to our loving one another in two prominent
    Scriptures. 1 John 4:20-21 makes it clear that, despite any claim we
    may make to the contrary, we cannot love God if we do not also love our
    brother. The other Scripture is a continuation of Yeshua''s statement that
    loving God is the most important commandment; in Matthew 22:39 he also
    said: " And a second is similar to it, ''You are to love your neighbor as
    yourself.'' " (See also, Mark 12:31 and Luke 10:27 ).'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The concept of ritual cleanness (clean vs. unclean) originates early in the
    Bible. Most of us have an intuitive sense of what it means to be clean
    physically, but when something is called "clean" or "unclean" in the Bible,
    there is usually a spiritual statement being made about it in that only what
    God declares to be clean is fit to be brought into His presence. So, for
    example, an unblemished lamb is still considered clean and was suitable for
    sacrificial worship (under Moses) even if it had recently rolled in mud. A
    pig, on the other hand, is unclean, and was unfit for sacrificial worship
    even had it been scrupulously washed down with soap and water. According to
    the Bible, things are intrinsically clean or unclean and, in addition, things
    (and persons) that are otherwise ritually clean, can become unclean for a
    time, according to where they have been, what they have done, or what they
    have touched. So, for example, a man is intrinsically clean, becomes
    temporarily unclean by touching a corpse, and returns to being clean at
    nightfall. A pig, on the other hand, is intrinsically unclean and can never
    be made clean. The concept of ritual cleanness is also connected to holiness (spiritual
    cleanness), and is exemplified by the fate of those who drank alcoholic
    beverages in the tent of meeting; for we read in Leviticus 10:9-10 : Don''t drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor, neither you nor your
    sons with you, when you enter the tent of meeting, so that you will not die.
    This is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations, so that
    you will distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean
    and the clean Yeshua considered the distinction between clean and unclean to be important,
    for he analogized it to holiness & wickedness in Luke 11:37-42 : As Yeshua spoke, a Parush asked him to eat dinner with him; so he went in
    and took his place at the table; and the Parush was surprised that he didn''t
    begin by doing n''tilat yadayim before the meal. However, the Lord said to
    him, "Now then, you P''rushim, you clean the outside of the cup and plate; but
    inside, you are full of robbery and wickedness. Fools! Didn''t the One who
    made the outside make the inside too? Rather, give as alms what is inside,
    and then everything will be clean for you! But woe to you P''rushim! You pay
    your tithes of mint and rue and every garden herb, but you ignore justice and
    the love of God. You have an obligation to do these things - but without
    disregarding the others! Animals, objects, food, and even people are either clean or unclean and,
    apart from their respective acceptability in temple worship, they sometimes
    have an obvious connection to health as well. For example, Leviticus
    13 reads like a medical text on how to diagnose and treat leprosy, and
    how to protect the population from its contagion. Some also try to make the
    case that eating non-kosher animals such as pig is unhealthy, but I do not
    attempt to make that case. It is clear how all of the ritual cleanness regulations had literal
    applicability in the time of Moses, but what about now? We have no Tabernacle
    or Temple today, leprosy (looked at by most scholars today as skin infections
    that include leprosy) is quickly and easily curable, and there is no
    functioning Levitical priesthood today to enforce the Mosaic regulations.
    Nevertheless, the laws of ritual cleanness serve to remind us that
    maintaining our physical health is a godly value that we must pursue
    rigorously. It is impossible to literally obey all of the ritual cleanness laws today.
    There remains, however, an area of analogy to these laws, and that is to
    conduct ourselves in such a way that we (both as Jews broadly and as Jewish
    or Gentile disciples of Yeshua) who are believers are distinguishable from
    those who are not. God also wants Jews to be distinguishable from non-Jews
    because He gave Israel a commission to be a "kingdom of priests" to the other
    nations of the world. God wants disciples of Yeshua to be distinguishable
    because all disciples of Yeshua (Jewish and non-Jewish disciples alike) have
    a responsibility to influence those who are not believers by what we say and
    how we are observed to live our lives. For those of us that are Jews, we have a plethora of traditional practices to
    draw from, many of which come directly from the biblical laws of ritual
    cleanness. One that tops the list is that we do not eat anything that comes
    from a pig. Two others are that we do not eat any land animal that does not
    have a split hoof and does not chew its cud, and we do not eat anything from
    the water that lacks fins and scales. There are, of course, other
    characteristics that distinguish us as well, such as our keeping of the
    Sabbath and the Appointed Times, wearing fringes with blue strands, and
    tacking m''zuzot to the doorposts of our houses. Ritual purification
    ceremonies survive today in the Orthodox Jewish practice of total immersion
    in mikvahs (specially constructed baths of water), and in the washing
    of the hands and fingers before and after meals (respectively), and at other
    times prescribed by Rabbinical tradition. Common reasons for total immersion
    are purification at the end of a woman''s menstrual cycle, by a woman prior to
    her wedding, and as part of conversion to Judaism. For those of us that are believers but are not Jews, some (but not all) of
    the Jewish identifying features are appropriate. For most of us, however, it
    is how we are observed to maintain godly values, in the things we say, and in
    how we live our lives. A list of items considered clean and unclean that are given in Leviticus
    11 to Leviticus 15 , Leviticus 22 , & Deuteronomy 23 appear in the appendix to this Mitzvah below.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Exodus 20:7 is best known for it being the third of the "Ten
    Commandments", rendered in the King James Version as: Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD
    will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. This translation and others like it, causes many to think that the
    Commandment is only about improperly invoking God''s name in the course of
    communicating verbally (e.g. cussing). That would mean not using the word
    "God", or one of his proper names, or "Yeshua", or " Ruach HaKodesh " in
    profane, disrespectful, or trivial expressions, either orally or in
    writing. 1 Doing so is indeed an obvious prohibition, but one less frequently talked
    about is profaning God''s Name by conducting our lives sinfully while, at the
    same time, professing to be a believer. Two common sayings (not in the
    Bible) apply here; "It is not so much what we say as what we do", and
    "Actions speak louder than words." It is the responsibility of all those who
    profess belief in God (and Yeshua) to represent God properly by conducting
    their lives in a holy manner. This responsibility falls especially on Jews
    (even Jews who do not profess belief in God) because the Jews are widely
    considered to be "God''s chosen people", and are therefore seen as
    representing God in all that they say and do. Sinful conduct by a Jew or a
    Gentile believer in God brings discredit, shame, and disgrace to His Name.
    Virtuous and holy conduct, on the other hand, brings Him honor and glory. Another and more obvious way of violating this Mitzvah is by
    prophesying in God''s Name falsely. The most common way of prophesying
    falsely is by declaring that God said something that He did not in fact say.
    A false prophecy can result from an innocent mistake or from an intentional
    deception, and it is not always preceded by a stylized announcement such as
    "Thus says the Lord." A prophecy is a serious declaration because anyone who
    hears it and believes that it originates with God is duty-bound to act on it
    or to conform his or her life to it. So, if an alleged prophecy is false
    (i.e. did not originate with God), it is capable of causing considerable
    damage, including to the reputation of prophetic words in general. That is
    why we must test all prophecies against Scripture, and exercise spiritual
    discernment through prayer. So serious was false prophecy considered under the Mosaic Covenant and Mosaic
    Law, that prophets who prophesied falsely were put to death ( Deuteronomy
    18:20 ). This "zero tolerance" standard was demanded because, in those
    days, only certain persons called "prophets" were given the Ruach
    HaKodesh , so all of Israel was dependent upon them for their
    communication with God. That is not the case today in the New Covenant,
    however, because today the Ruach HaKodesh is available to all
    believers in Yeshua, and therefore, to one extent or another, all believers
    are able to hear God and prophesy. 1. Orthodox Jewish tradition seeks to respect God''s
    Name by making substitutions when writing or speaking of Him. Examples are
    substituting "G-d" for "God" in writing, or using substitute words (e.g. Hashem ) or manufactured words (e.g. Adoshem and Elokeynu ) in the course of ordinary speech.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures quoted herein include those that are referred to by
    Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch to support their respective mitzvot about the waging of war. Nevertheless, because conditions today (whether in
    Israel or elsewhere in the world) are different than during the time of
    Moses, we cannot and should not seek to apply the commandments literally.
    That notwithstanding, even those commandments that we deem obsolete contain
    principles that are helpful and even applicable today, hence the title of
    this Mitzvah "Biblical Principles of War", and my brief attempt to
    highlight some of them: TAKING A CENSUS The census of men twenty years of age and over who were subject to military
    service referred to in Numbers 1:2-3 , has its counterpart in the U.S.
    Selective Service System and in military conscription programs in other
    countries as well. Its purpose is to assess military readiness in case a
    call to arms is needed. EXCLUSION OF LEVITES FROM MILITARY SERVICE The Levites had priestly duties that had to continue during military
    campaigns and they were therefore excluded from the fighting. Today, there
    are no priests and a portable Tabernacle for them to care for, but the United
    States does recognize the special calling of ordained ministers by excusing
    them from compulsory military service. What is more, ordained ministers that
    volunteer to serve as military chaplains are excluded from fighting alongside
    the troops to whom they minister. ORDINARY MEN EXEMPT FROM MILITARY SERVICE Israelite men were exempt from military service if they had recently planted
    a vineyard of fruit, if they were engaged to marry, if they were a new
    husband, and if they were afraid. At various times since World War II,
    American men were deferred from the Selective Service System''s draft if they
    were a full-time student, if they were married, if they had a young a child,
    and if they had certain medical conditions or disabilities. At earlier times
    in U.S. history, men could buy their way out of military service, or be
    excused by providing a substitute replacement. OCCUPYING CONQUERED LANDS The Israelites had to cross over the Jordan and possess the lands that they
    conquered. Overpowering their adversaries was not enough; actual possession
    was required. We in the U.S. sometimes forget that principle in wars of today
    where we strike a blow and then pull back for fear that we will be accused of
    being called conquerors. Not only do we refrain from possessing the land we
    take in battle, we pay to restore it and give it back to our former enemies. NOT BEING AFRAID There was a reason that the Israelites were not to be afraid, and that is
    that God was fighting on their side. We have no such guarantee in a secular
    nation that goes to war without first inquiring of God. APPOINTMENT OF MILITARY COMMANDERS In ancient Israel, commanders were appointed from the ranks just before
    battles, whereas in the modern world, commanders are usually appointed from a
    pool of professionally trained soldiers. Early in U.S. history men of means
    could purchase a military command, and there have also been occasions when
    appointment as an officer (including a commanding officer) was made based on
    political considerations. MARRYING WOMEN PRISONERS According to Scripture, a man could take a woman prisoner as his wife as
    though she were his chattel. In some parts of the world that may still be the
    case but, in the western countries, women must consent to marriage. TAKING THE POSSESSIONS OF A CONQUERED ENEMY AS BOOTY There were occasions when ancient Israelite soldiers were allowed (even
    commanded) to take for themselves the possessions of those whom they
    conquered. There were also times recorded in Scripture when they were
    commanded not to take possessions, and to destroy them instead. Taking booty
    in modern wars is discouraged but still happens - especially in third world
    countries. GUARDING AGAINST SICKNESS & MAINTAINING SANITATION Isolating those who are sick and maintaining sanitary conditions within
    military camps are as necessary today as they were in ancient Israel. MEN WHO WILL NOT FIGHT At all times in history there were those who, when called to serve in the
    military, have refused. Those who were fearful were sometimes excused on the
    premise that they posed a danger to their fighting comrades, and sometimes
    they were punished. In the U.S. in modern times, religious conscientious
    objectors were allowed to perform alternative civilian service, and others
    who refused were prosecuted. ESTABLISHING LASTING PEACE Establishing lasting peace has always been a goal of mankind even while
    seeking to achieve it through war. As Isaiah 2:3-5 states: Then they will hammer their swords into plow-blades and their spears into
    pruning-knives; nations will not raise swords at each other, and they will no
    longer learn war.'

  commentary_rudolph: '"Damages" is that aspect of law that has to do with loss. If damage is to a
    person, we call it "injury". Damages that are actionable (recoverable from
    another) originate in either "tort" or "contract". A tort is a wrongful act
    (intentional or unintentional) that infringes the rights of another and leads
    to damages. An example of an intentional tort is assault, and of an
    unintentional tort is negligence that causes damages. A contract is an
    agreement between parties, and damages can result from a party either
    intentionally or unintentionally failing to fulfill his or her part of the
    agreement. An intentional bailment is usually a contract to place one''s
    property in the custody and care of another. A bailment can, however, come
    about unintentionally, such as when one finds and takes temporary possession
    lost property. Depending on the circumstance of what causes damage or injury, appropriate
    remedies can be restitution, paying compensatory money damages, paying
    punitive damages (in the case of an intentional or reckless tort or gross
    negligence), specific performance of a contract (a court order to perform a
    contract as agreed), etc. What we are speaking of here are infractions of
    civil law as distinguished from criminal law, but they sometimes overlap. An
    example of overlap is theft. Theft is a civil offense to the victim who
    incurs financial damage, and it is simultaneously a criminal offense to
    society at large because of damage to the peace of the community. Bringing a
    thief to justice can, therefore, involve making restitution to the person
    from whom he stole, paying a fine to society, and also possibly a jail
    sentence. The Scriptures listed above each speak to circumstances and conduct that can
    and often do cause damages. The torts, contracts, and remedies illustrated by
    the Scriptures are mere examples of others that exist, but they serve to make
    the point. Some of them are geared more to the time of Moses than to today,
    but similarities to modern situations can easily be seen, which is why our
    contemporary laws have largely been derived from these ancient examples. In
    today''s urban society I do not have an ox to be gored by my neighbor''s ox,
    but I do have a car that could conceivably be gored by his car; it is the
    same principle. In order for a civil court to have the capacity to adjudicate a claim for
    damages, it must have three kinds of jurisdiction - personal, territorial,
    and subject matter. An ecclesiastical court (a Jewish court is called a bet din ) must have these as well, except that its territorial
    jurisdiction is considered the entire world. Civil courts get their subject
    matter jurisdiction from civil law (e.g. statutes, ordinances, case law,
    etc.) and ecclesiastical courts get their subject matter jurisdiction from
    the Bible. Personal jurisdiction is acquired in various ways. In the civil
    courts it is sometimes acquired by the defendant''s domicile, sometimes to
    where the damages sued for occurred, and sometimes it is defined by statute.
    Personal jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical court is a debated matter. It
    should be over all believers in Yeshua if it is a church court, and over Jews
    (Messianic or not Messianic) if it is a bet din . Sometimes, personal
    jurisdiction is acquired by the defendant being a member of a congregation,
    denomination, network of congregations, or organization. Plaintiffs are
    automatically subject to the jurisdiction of whatever court they apply to for
    relief.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures that teach against murder appear to be of two kinds - the
    majority of them speak only of killing the physical body, and a few of them
    hint at a non-physical kind of murder - hostility in one''s heart to one''s
    brother. Of all the Scriptures on murder, Exodus 20:13 is the most well-known
    because it is among the "Ten Commandments". Murder (the intentional
    unrighteous killing of a human being) is universally perceived to be wrong,
    even by those who do not believe in God; it is what secularists may sometimes
    call "natural law". God Himself does not kill with impunity either. He
    values those whom He has created in His image and, when men do otherwise to
    their fellow men with intention, God deems it evil as though they are seeking
    to destroy God Himself. We see this clearly in Genesis 9:6 , which
    associates murder with destroying God''s image; it reads: Whoever sheds human blood, by a human being will his own blood be shed;
    for God made human beings in his image. Perhaps the same rationale explains 1 John 3:15 that extends the sin
    of murder to hating one''s brother, for it says: Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no
    murderer has eternal life in him. Seeking to kill a man who is created in God''s image is akin to coming against
    God Himself, and is quite the opposite of receiving Him as Lord and Messiah
    by which we are saved. In a similar way, Matthew 5:22 states: But I tell you that anyone who nurses anger against his brother will be
    subject to judgment; that whoever calls his brother, ''You good-for-nothing!''
    will be brought before the Sanhedrin; that whoever says, ''Fool!'' incurs the
    penalty of burning in the fire of Gei-Hinnom! Murder, probably because of its permanently destructive nature, is presented
    as the quintessential opposite of loving our neighbor for, as Romans
    13:10 states: Love does not do harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fullness of
    Torah. In the Bible, the penalty for murder is always death. That notwithstanding,
    the biblical law (similar to modern secular law) recognizes a category of
    justifiable killing and also unjustifiable killing that is a lesser crime
    than murder (terms used today are "murder in the second degree",
    "manslaughter", "negligent homicide", etc.). Murder is ordinarily
    distinguished from these lesser offenses by whether there was intention,
    deliberation, premeditation, provocation, and malice. Examples of
    justifiable killing are self-defense and killing in battle. Culpability in
    the case of accidental killing has to do with whether or not negligence
    contributed to the death. Not precisely analogous but interestingly, whereas modern systems of justice
    typically employ imprisonment as a penalty for these lesser categories of
    homicide, the biblical law provides cities of refuge to which a man who has
    killed another (excluding intentional murder) might flee to avoid being
    seized upon and killed by the deceased''s vengeful relatives.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Tithing first appears in the Bible when Abraham gives one-tenth of the
    increase of his wealth to Melchizedek ( Genesis 14:18-20 ), and it
    appears again in Genesis 28:13-22 , when God promises Jacob blessing
    and land, and Jacob, in turn, promises to return ten percent of that which he
    is given by way of provision back to God. This was not, as some construe it,
    an attempt on Jacob''s part to bargain with God, but rather an expression of
    Jacob''s acceptance of the Covenant that had just been passed on to him, and
    his acknowledgement that all things with which he would be blessed in
    fulfillment of that Covenant belonged to God. The tithe appears again as part of the Mosaic Law, in which the Israelites
    were commanded to give one-tenth of their increase (usually crops and
    animals) to sustain the Levites who had no inheritance of land. Offerings
    over and above tithes, used for other purposes, are also prescribed in the
    Mosaic Law (certain offerings were required and certain ones were voluntary),
    but a percentage of income was not required of offerings as it was of tithes.
    Finally, there was tz''dakah ; giving to the poor and to good causes,
    though not required, was expected and was considered a matter of moral
    justice and not mere benevolence. What survives in the New Covenant of these three today is not a requirement
    of law, but rather the principle of giving to God''s work and to those in
    need. One sometimes hears that tithing to one''s church or synagogue is
    required , and that is not right. One also sometimes hears that tithing to
    one''s church or synagogue today is no longer appropriate , and that is
    not right either. The reason I can espouse these seemingly contradictory
    things is that, like many things of the Mosaic Law, certain of its principles
    find their way into the New Covenant, while the particulars and the
    enforcement mechanisms of the Mosaic Law do not. There is no true comparison of our congregational sanctuaries today to that
    of the Tabernacle and Temple, except that they are (as the Tabernacle and
    Temple were then) places where the believing community goes periodically to
    meet God in prayer and worship, mediated through priests and a High Priest.
    Years ago they were the Levitical priests and Aaron was the High Priest, but
    now we (the priesthood of believers) are the priests, and Yeshua our Messiah
    is the High Priest. There is another similarity of "then and now" in that
    both institutions - the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and the synagogue -
    have expenses of upkeep. In Mosaic times the expenses included maintaining
    the Levites, and today it includes mortgage payments on our buildings, and
    the salaries of clergy and other employees. Whereas tithes and offerings were prescribed by the Mosaic Law for
    maintaining the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and its priests, we have no
    such law today but each institution today (synagogues, apostolic networks,
    etc.) prescribes the way(s) that its members will maintain
    it. 1 In denominational synagogues, support of the
    institution is usually through membership fees and charging for High Holy Day
    seats, and in Christian churches and Messianic Synagogues it is usually
    through members paying ten percent tithes on their income - a logical
    adaptation of the Mosaic Law. As for special offerings and tz''dakah , they are as needed today as in the past because
    membership fees and tithes cannot take care of every need. Messianic
    communities take up "freewill" offerings to cover such needs, and members of
    the traditional Jewish community often consider that charitable giving
    ( tz''dakah ) of ten percent is their minimum moral obligation. 1. In church history, a justification for enforced tithing by
    state churches has analogized elders to priests, and shamashim (deacons) to Levites.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures are clear that we are not to listen to those who would lead us
    toward idolatry. Although they refer to physical idols and false gods, Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 consider anything to be a "god"
    or an idol that competes with the one true God by becoming man''s master, or
    that we put ahead of the one true God. Such idols can be money, sexual
    immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, property, power, security, greed,

  commentary_rudolph: 'In ancient times, widows, orphans, and the poor were the principal
    disadvantaged classes, so when we read commandments related to them, it is
    fair to interpret them to include persons with other disadvantages and
    weaknesses brought about by circumstance. Scripture is clear that God is
    against anyone who exploits such persons or causes them harm. Indeed, they
    are to be protected and ministered to so that they may overcome their
    respective weaknesses or even be delivered from them. This is a proactive
    responsibility related to loving the stranger, our neighbor and even our
    enemy, helping our neighbor who is in need, and giving charity. It is not
    sufficient to merely do them no harm; it is required that we seek to improve
    their condition to the extent possible. Deuteronomy 24:14 makes it clear that we are not to exploit a poor and
    needy worker whether he is a brother or a stranger, and the examples of
    Yeshua and His disciples are that they did not distinguish between brothers
    and strangers in who they attempted to proactively help. As in the giving of
    charity, the Holy Spirit must be consulted to determine the level of help
    that is reasonable and required of us in each circumstance that comes to our
    attention. It is important to keep in mind that exploitation is not just benefitting
    from a person; it is deriving benefit from another unfairly by preying on his
    weakness. Not only does Scripture demand that we not do this, but it requires
    the opposite - that we seek to help disadvantaged persons and, to the extent
    that we are able, give them relief from their disability.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah directs us to honor and respect persons of advanced age
    for two important reasons. First, those who have lived longer than we are
    assumed to have acquired wisdom through their greater life experiences, and
    presumably also through walking with the Lord for a longer period of time.
    Second, whatever knowledge and wisdom younger people may have, they have
    likely acquired (in large measure) through the life experiences and God-given
    wisdom of their
    elders 2 including from their parents ( Proverbs 22:6 ). Why is this Mitzvah needed? Regrettably, it is because, too
    frequently, persons of advanced age are not respected. I suggest that the
    reason for this is because older persons, over time, lose some of their
    physical attributes that are visible, while the ways in which they gain
    (knowledge, wisdom, and experience) are less visible and less tangible. When Moses needed help governing Israel, he chose seventy men of advanced age
    who were already respected leaders. It is also why 1 Timothy 3:2-12 instructs us that when we ordain elders to govern our New Covenant
    communities, each appointee must (among other things) be a man who is "above
    reproach", "faithful to his wife", "self-controlled", "able to teach", be a
    good manager "of his own household", have "children who obey him with all
    proper respect", and he must not be a new believer. All of these come to a
    man over time and with age, and it is why they are called "elders". Although the Scriptures that pertain to this subject refer mainly to men,
    women are included as well. Women are, of course, to be honored and obeyed as
    mothers regardless of their age ( Exodus 20:12 ; Ephesians 6:1-3 ), but older women, in particular, are exhorted to
    conduct their lives in holiness so that they are able to train younger women
    in the ways of the Lord ( Titus 2:3-5 ). Because men, regardless of
    their abilities, are not competent (nor is it appropriate for them) to train
    women in many areas, women who have wisdom and experience that comes with
    advanced age and who are also filled with the Holy Spirit, are exceedingly
    valuable and are needed in every community. 2. "Elders" here means persons who are older.'

    Messiah Yeshua who is said by Scripture to be God''s Word and the "bread of

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah "Keeping Our Promises" is a generalization of several
    more specific mitzvot promulgated by the Classical Commentators
    Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch having to do with keeping oral commitments,
    and delaying or revoking vows. In addition to the Torah Scriptures, our obligation to keep our
    promises appears to also be the message of Matthew 5:33-37 and James 5:12 , their general rule being: ... let your ''Yes'' be simply ''Yes'' and your ''No'' simply ''No''. James advises against swearing oaths to emphasize one''s truthfulness.
    The expectation is that whatever New Covenant believers say ought to be so
    trustworthy that, except for society''s requirement of submission to judicial
    authorities and its laws pertaining to certain legal documents, we should
    avoid swearing oaths. It is part of the intensification of Torah in
    the New Covenant. The literal application of Numbers 30:4-16(3-15) was operative under
    the Mosaic Covenant in ancient Israel when women had fewer legal rights than
    men, and their fathers or husbands could intercede to nullify their vows made
    to God and others. That may continue to be the secular law in various places
    of the world today, and it is the prevailing secular law today that parents
    can nullify contracts made by their minor children, and guardians can nullify
    commitments made by those who are adjudicated legally incompetent. It should
    not have to be said (but I will say it), that under the New Covenant (also
    under today''s Anglo-American law), adult women are no longer legally
    subordinate to their fathers and husbands as they were in the past.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'A vow is a promise uttered with deliberate solemnity. An oath is an
    utterance added to a vow that invokes an authority capable of enforcing the
    vow, and punishing the oath-maker if the vow is breached. When a person adds
    an oath to his vow, he is giving an assurance that is in addition to his
    personal honor. He is essentially saying that if he reneges on his promise,
    he invites the invoked authority to enforce his compliance and/or mete out
    punishment. It is clear from many Scriptures in the Tanakh (e.g. Deuteronomy
    10:20 ) that God endorses the swearing of oaths, but in His Name alone.
    That makes perfect sense since if a vow is serious enough to require the
    added assurance of an oath, no authority other than God can be counted upon
    to enforce it ( Deuteronomy 6:13-15 ). Also, when we swear an oath by
    God''s Name we invoke His Honor; therefore, if we swear falsely we profane His
    Name ( Leviticus 19:12 ). The Tanakh contains many examples of oaths sworn in ancient times,
    and even God has been known to swear an oath on occasion (e.g. Hebrews
    6:13-17 ). In more recent times, oaths are most commonly sworn ancillary
    to giving legal testimony in a court of law. When oaths are sworn outside of
    a court proceeding they are called "notarizations", and are generally for
    attesting to the accuracy of a legal document or for affirming the
    authenticity of a signature. There are some who refuse to swear oaths based on their interpretation of Matthew 5:34 and James 5:12 that contain the words " But I
    tell you not to swear at all ... " and " Above all, brothers, stop
    swearing oaths ... " respectively. Their explanation for how this can be
    in light of God''s teaching and the many examples in the Tanakh , is
    that Yeshua changed the rules for the New Covenant in order to raise the
    standard of truth-telling to a higher level. That is not correct for, if one
    looks at the Matthew and James "statements" that were taken out of context,
    when each one''s entire verse and adjacent verses are returned to them, one
    sees that there is no contradiction at all. In fact, Matthew 5:33-37 affirms the importance and legitimacy of oaths made in God''s Name by warning
    that we should not swear by "heaven", by "earth", by "Jerusalem", by one''s
    "head" or, by extension, by anything else that is not "God". Similarly, James 5:12 admonishes the reader to stop swearing oaths by "heaven",
    by "earth", or by "any other formula". These verses of Scripture are
    apparently intended to stop a common practice of invoking meaningless
    authorities for their effect in enhancing the oath-taker''s appearance that
    he is telling the truth (when he would never promise the same thing if he
    was swearing in God''s Name). Instead, a man should be able to put forth his
    reputation that his "yes" and his "no" (i.e. whatever he says) can be relied
    upon without reinforcement. The Scriptures prohibit using God''s Name lightly ( Exodus 20:7 ), but
    do not, in any way, prohibit swearing oaths in God''s Name in appropriate
    situations. Matthew 23:16-24 explains this especially well, and
    infers a warning to the oath-taker that he deludes himself if he thinks that
    his oath is not binding just because it does not invoke God''s Name directly.
    Yeshua scolds the teachers and Pharisees for using "oath formulas" that
    create the appearance of enforceability, while their secret intent is to not
    honor their vows. It is intentional casuistry, and they will be held to
    their word by God nevertheless.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is derived primarily from Genesis 2:24 : This is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his
    wife, and they are to be one
    flesh. 1 The resulting "one flesh" is what makes the leaving and cleaving covenantal,
    and the fact that the commandment appears so early in Genesis is why I
    call it a "creation" covenant (to distinguish it from other covenants that
    came later). We commonly call this covenant "marriage". You will notice that several of the Scriptures from the Tanakh cited
    above are labeled "obsolete". That is because circumstances and conditions
    today are so different than during the time of Moses. Back then, the
    Scriptures that are now obsolete made perfect sense and could be implemented,
    while today they cannot. Although this Mitzvah is expressed as a "man" leaving his parents to
    join with his wife, the covenant of becoming "one flesh" cannot be fulfilled
    unless the man''s intended wife similarly leaves her parents. The "leaving"
    of parents in the Scripture is not a reference to where the couple resides.
    The Scripture is speaking of the controlling influence that parents rightly
    have over their young unmarried children, but which is improper and
    interfering if it is allowed to continue once the child (man or woman)
    becomes married. I believe the reason Genesis 2:24 reads the way it does, is that a
    man''s responsibility to leave his parents is different from a woman''s. It is
    the man''s responsibility to take the initiative in leaving, but it is the
    woman''s parents'' responsibility to release her to her intended husband. The
    implication of her parents not doing so is, of course, obvious and, after
    marriage, problems result when either or both of the marrieds allow improper
    ties to their parents to continue. The concept of becoming "one flesh" is not only covenantal, but also mystical
    and difficult to comprehend. Mark 10:8b attempts to explain it by
    stating: Thus they are no longer two, but one. Ephesians 5:29-32 relates the phenomenon to Messiah and the Body of
    Believers by stating: Why, no one ever hated his own flesh! On the contrary, he feeds it well
    and takes care of it, just as the Messiah does the Messianic Community,
    because we are parts of his Body. "Therefore a man will leave his father and
    mother and remain with his wife, and the two will become one." There is
    profound truth hidden here, which I say concerns the Messiah and the
    Messianic Community. This "oneness" possibly reminds one of the plural unity of the Father, Son,
    and Holy Spirit. Genesis 2:24 has been interpreted, in some quarters, as requiring
    everyone to marry. I do not view it that way, especially in light of
    Paul''s remarks in 1 Corinthians 7:8, 32-35 . I believe that Scripture
    teaches that the norm of creation is to marry and procreate, but it allows
    for not doing so and, in some cases, singleness is God''s will for an
    individual (see Matthew 19:12 ). This Mitzvah includes Scriptures that prohibit marriage to certain
    persons. These include family members with whom we cannot have sexual
    relations, persons with whom we are unequally yoked, Jews marrying persons of
    certain nations, etc. It also includes persons that a cohen cannot
    marry. Secular law also puts restrictions on marrying family members in order
    to avoid weakening the human genetic pool and allowing unwanted recessive
    traits to emerge. 1. Some translations state "cleave" to his wife.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Coveting another''s property is desiring it or longing for it. Planning to
    acquire another''s property is the next step in coveting; it is sin, but falls
    short of theft or some other way to improperly take the thing coveted into
    one''s possession. Coveting is not merely saying: "It would be nice to have
    that thing." It is a desire to have something (that belongs to another) that
    is so strong that one''s mind dwells on it and how to acquire it through even
    improper means. The Scriptures are clear that such desire, whether or not
    accompanied by a plan to acquire it improperly, is sin. Wanting an item that
    belongs to another and offering to purchase it for a fair price is not
    prohibited and is not sin unless the longing for it exceeds reason.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'We are to count seven Sabbaths of years (forty-nine years) from each Year of
    Jubilee to the next. When the Year of Jubilee arrives, we are not to
    cultivate our land or harvest its crops in the usual way, and we are to
    return it to its prior owner, the one who sold it to us. When land is sold,
    it must not be sold in perpetuity, and a right of redemption by the seller
    must be an inherent part of the sale. In a very real sense, therefore, the
    sale of land is not of the land itself, but of the value of the crops that
    the land is likely to produce until the next Jubilee. The Year of Jubilee, similar to the Sh''mittah , can be viewed as a time
    of faith and benevolence because the crops that grow of their own accord
    (without cultivation) during the year is available for all to glean,
    including those who are poor. The Jubilee can also be viewed as a mitzvah of social and economic equalization, because Israelites that
    become wealthy through land that they have occupied, have to give the source
    of their wealth up in the Year of Jubilee. Like the Sh''mittah , I believe that the primary reason for God giving
    the Jubilee Year to the Israelites was to hone their faith and cause them to
    have to trust Him for their provision. A question that naturally comes to
    mind, of course, is how resting our land and returning it to its prior owner
    applies to us today. I am of the opinion that it can only apply literally as
    in the past, where today''s circumstances are similar to those under which the
    ancient Israelites lived. So far as I am aware it is never the case since
    the assumption of Scripture regarding the Jubilee is that (1) it is meant to
    apply only in the Land of Israel, and (2) it is meant to apply by the entire
    population so that the burden of returning land that one has bought does not
    unjustly fall on just a few individuals who are willing to comply. Still, all
    Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable ( 2 Timothy 3:16-17 ), so
    we ought to consider how to use the inspiration when the Year of Jubilee
    arrives. I propose that we consider it a time to reflect on our faith by
    considering what our willingness would be to rest our land (should we own
    land in geographic Israel) and give it up in the Jubilee year as a
    demonstration of our trust and reliance on God.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The biblical covenant of marriage consists of one man and one woman joined
    together to become "one flesh." On one level, "one flesh" is a mystical
    concept that is difficult to understand but, on a practical level, it defines
    marriage as being a covenant of exclusive intimacy between lifelong partners,
    most of whom will produce offspring. We do not profess to know why God
    allowed men to have multiple wives during the Mosaic and pre-Mosaic periods,
    but it seems not to have been God''s best for us from the beginning
    ( Genesis 2:24 and Ephesians 5:31 ), and it is clearly not his
    will for us today, as Scripture applies it to elders in 1 Timothy 3:2a &
    12 and Titus 1:6a . According to Malachi 2:13-16 , God hates divorce. He instructed the
    Israelites to not abandon their marriage covenants through "breaking faith"
    - a reference to sexual infidelity in marriage. Although sexual infidelity
    (e.g. adultery) is the only ground for a believer to divorce another
    believer, it is not the only way to violate one''s covenant of marriage;
    any abandonment or desertion is a violation but, except for the abandonment
    of adultery, the violation does not release the innocent spouse to seek a
    decree of divorce from his or her believing spouse. Abandonment most often
    means physically leaving, but there are other ways to abandon a spouse.
    Committing adultery is one such abandonment, but so is physical abuse,
    emotional abuse, child abuse, refusing to engage in sexual intimacy, refusing
    to provide financial support, exposing one''s family to unnecessary
    danger, etc. Wrongful as these are, they are not - except for adultery -
    grounds for a believer to seek a divorce from another believer. Before going further, let us define some terms that are used here.
    "Violating" one''s covenant of marriage means doing something that is contrary
    to the terms of the covenant, but no violation in itself automatically ends a
    covenant of marriage. A violation may be of the kind that allows the
    innocent party to take steps to end the covenant by pursuing a decree of
    "divorce" (adultery), but the innocent party may choose to overlook or
    forgive even the most serious transgression and continue in the marriage as
    before. No violation provides grounds for the guilty party to "create facts
    of the ground" in order to initiate ending the covenant. The biblical law of divorce may be (and usually is) different from the
    secular law of nation states. Indeed, the very meaning of the word
    "divorce" is subject to a number of interpretations and, rather than discuss
    each of them, we have set forth our view, and invite the reader to reach his
    or her own conclusions. There is no single Hebrew or Greek noun in the
    biblical texts for "divorce" as there is in English. The underlying Hebrew
    noun for "divorce" is " sefer k''riytut ", and the equivalent Greek
    noun is " biblion apostasion ", - both meaning "decree of divorce",
    "bill of divorcement", or " get ". The Hebrew and Greek nouns
    respectively translated "divorce" do not have the same meaning as does the
    English noun. In English, when one speaks of "a divorce", one is referring
    to a legal action that terminates a marriage. In the Bible, however, the
    above Hebrew and Greek words that are typically translated "divorce" do not
    terminate anything - rather, they formally document that which has occurred,
    which is that one or both of the spouses have abandoned their marriage
    covenant through un-covenantal conduct, and the innocent spouse has declared
    the marriage ended. So for example, a get (a Jewish decree of
    divorce) is legal confirmation that a marriage has ended, but it does not
    itself end the covenant. The covenant is dissolved the way it was made -
    through the words of the parties - in this case, by the innocent party. A
    consequence of this is, therefore, even if an innocent spouse obtains a get , if it has been obtained for a biblically unauthorized reason, the get is void ab initio , the marriage remains intact, and any
    party that marries or remarries in reliance on the invalid get commits
    adultery. Whenever a verse of Scripture says that a divorced (and remarried) party is
    an adulterer or has committed adultery by virtue of a remarriage, such a
    thing is logically possible only if he or she is still married to the
    original spose at the time that the remarriage occurred. Matthew
    5:31-32 , Matthew 19:9 and Luke 16:18 are examples of this;
    they state: It was said, ''Whoever divorces his wife must give her a get.''
    But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of
    fornication, makes her an adulteress; and that anyone who marries a divorcee
    commits adultery. 1 ( Matthew 5:31-32 ) Now what I say to you is that whoever divorces his wife, except on the
    ground of sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits
    adultery! ( Matthew 19:9 ) Every man who divorces his wife and marries [in order to marry] another woman commits adultery, and a man who marries a woman divorced by
    her husband commits adultery. ( Luke 16:18 ) Matthew 5:31-32 seems to be making an adulteress out of an innocent
    wife. Although she has not committed adultery, she somehow becomes an
    adulteress by virtue of her husband having divorced her on an invalid ground.
    How can that be so? The explanation for this can be deduced from what we
    have previously said about a decree of divorce - that it does not break a
    marriage covenant in and of itself. Also, whereas the above Scriptures
    appear to infer that only husbands can initiate divorce, later Scriptures
    such as Mark 10:11-12 infer that a wife may do so as well. Luke 16:18 and Mark 10:11-12 , as commonly translated, appear to
    be saying that anyone who divorces and re-marries commits adultery. This can
    only be true if the divorce is invalid so, in what circumstance might the
    divorce referred to be invalid? I am of the opinion that the Scriptures are
    speaking of divorces that are obtained for the explicit purpose of marrying
    another, and so they might rightly read: Every man who divorces his wife [in order to marry] another woman commits
    adultery, and a man who marries a woman divorced by her husband commits
    adultery (Luke 16:18). and He said to them, ''Whoever divorces his wife [in order to marry]
    another woman commits adultery against his wife; and if a wife divorces her
    husband [in order to marry] another man, she too commits adultery'' (Mark 10:11-12). As indicated previously, a get does not, in and of itself, break the
    marriage covenant. Therefore, if Spouse A procures a get against
    Spouse B on a ground that is not biblically authorized, their marriage
    covenant remains intact despite the invalid get . If either spouse
    (let''s say Spouse B) then marries another (and presumably has sexual
    relations with that other) in reliance on the invalid get , he or she
    and the new spouse (Spouse C) are momentarily in adultery, and their attempt
    at marriage is ineffective because the unauthorized get did not end
    the first marriage. The cohabitation of Spouse B and C therefore comprises
    adultery and/or fornication, and a new ground is thus created for A to seek a
    divorce against B - this time on a biblically valid ground. If and when that
    is done, the impediment to the marriage between B and C is removed, and their
    marriage becomes legitimized automatically. The lesson in all of this is (1)
    do not seek to divorce in the first place, and (2) if you find yourself with
    a court-ordered decree of divorce regardless of who procured it or what court
    it is from, do not remarry unless the decree was obtained on biblically
    allowed grounds. A heavy burden is placed on an innocent marriage partner who has an improper
    decree of divorce forced on him or her by a spouse that does not remarry or
    commit adultery in some other way. Under these circumstances, any get that is obtained does not end the marriage, and the innocent party, although
    abandoned and in possession of a get is not, at the moment, released
    to obtain his or her own get and remarry. There is, however, a biblical remedy for this; it is for the innocent spouse
    to lodge a complaint against the abandoning spouse pursuant to Matthew
    18:15-17 which states: Moreover, if your brother [in this case sister in Messiah] commits a sin
    against you, go and show him his fault - but privately, just between the two
    of you. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother. If he
    doesn''t listen, take one or two others with you so that every accusation
    can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses
    to hear them, tell the congregation; and if he refuses to listen even to the
    congregation, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector [i.e. an
    unbeliever]. If the complaining spouse follows the aforesaid sequence of steps and, in the
    midst of it (or after its completion) the abandoning spouse (who has not
    remarried) repents, remarries his spouse and returns to his spouse to fulfill
    the marriage covenant by mutual consent, then all is well. If, however, he or
    she does not repent and a bet din 2 rules that he or she should be treated as an unbeliever pursuant to Matthew 18:17 , then 1 Corinthians 7:15 can be invoked by the
    innocent spouse, which said Scripture states: But if the unbelieving spouse separates himself, let him be separated. In
    circumstances like these, the brother or sister is not enslaved - God has
    called you to a life of peace. This Scripture enables the innocent spouse to petition for a a writ of
    divorce in a public court and, if obtained, the marriage is declared to be
    over, and both parties are officially released to remarry. It might seem
    unfair that the party who is in the wrong is equally free to remarry but that
    is, nevertheless, the case. Although the Scriptures seem to make adultery the only ground for which a
    believer can sue his or her believing spouse for a get , the
    adjudication of other sins of abandonment using the Matthew 18 process
    can, nevertheless, result in a get being granted provided the
    offending spouse is found by a bet din to be unrepentant and is
    ordered to be treated as an unbeliever ( verse 17 ). In such a case, 1 Corinthians 7:15 may be invoked against the unbelieving spouse that
    has been adjudicated to be unrepentant: But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is
    not under bondage [the bond of matrimony has been broken] in such cases. But
    God has called us to peace. The unbelieving spouse''s continued lack of repentance justifies the
    conclusion that the unbeliever has departed. We would be remiss were we not to remind the reader that 2 Corinthians
    6:14 warns against a believer covenanting with an unbeliever: Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers. For how can
    righteousness and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have
    with darkness? What harmony can there be between the Messiah and
    B''liya''al? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What
    agreement can there be between the temple of God and idols? For we are the
    temple of the living God - as God said, "I will house myself in them ... and
    I will walk among you. I will be their God, and they will be my people. The reason is obvious in that believers and unbelievers (by definition) walk
    according to different beliefs and values. They will eventually pull in
    against each other causing conflict, or the believer will compromise his or
    her values in order to keep the peace. 1. " anyone who marries a divorcee commits
    adultery " refers to a divorcee whose marriage remains valid. 2. A bet din is a
    Jewish ecclesiastical court whose judges generally consist of elders, and
    where rules of due process apply. There are Christian counterparts of such
    a court in Roman Catholicism and certain other Christian denominations, and
    the important thing to keep in mind is that their rulings are often at odds
    with those of secular courts because, even when both courts have
    jurisdiction over the subject matter (e.g. divorce) and the litigating
    parties, they are bound by different laws. Some hold the position that, anyone that wishes to seek a decree of divorce
    against his or her spouse, must do so twice (once in each kind of court) in
    order to fulfill both biblical and secular requirements (see 1
    Corinthians 6:1-8 ). That is the Orthodox Jewish view. My view is
    that if one first obtains a get from a bet din , one must
    follow it up with a secular divorce in order to be free to remarry in our
    society. However, if one obtains a secular divorce on a biblical ground
    (e.g. adultery), because the ground produces the same result in both
    courts, it is my opinion that one does not need to repeat the process in a bet din ; the secular court''s decree of divorce will suffice.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'At first impression, Matthew 5:48 ( Therefore, be perfect, just as
    your Father in heaven is perfect ) and Leviticus 11:45 ( Therefore you are to be holy, because I am holy ) seem highly
    presumptuous and even blasphemous. As God''s creation, we are so far below
    His holiness and perfection - how can we even think of being holy and perfect
    as He is? Yet, we are commanded to be holy and perfect, so somehow it is
    possible even though it seems impossible in light of our spiritual
    imperfections. The answer is suggested in Leviticus 22:32 : " I am ADONAI, who makes
    you holy ... " In other words, we cannot aspire to holiness and
    perfection in our own power; we have to receive it from God Himself, and
    realize that for us it is a never-ending goal rather than one that we will
    achieve during our lifetime. In the Mosaic Covenant, the Israelites pursued
    holiness through repentance and the prescribed Tabernacle (later Temple)
    sacrifices. In the New Covenant, we are made holy by being one with Yeshua,
    "the Holy One of Israel". Only through his blood sacrifice can we be made
    holy and aspire toward perfection, for we read in 1 John 1:9 : If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he [Yeshua] is trustworthy and
    just, he will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The un-regenerated man seeks man''s approval over God''s. It is a hold-over
    from the fall of mankind in the Garden of Eden. But Ephesians 4:22-24 instructs us: ... so far as your former way of life is concerned, you must strip off
    your old nature, because your old nature is thoroughly rotted by its
    deceptive desires; and you must let your spirits and minds keep being
    renewed, and clothe yourselves with the new nature created to be godly, which
    expresses itself in the righteousness and holiness that flow from the
    truth. It is not wrong to seek men''s approval so long as we put God''s approval
    first: 1 Peter 2:13-14 For the sake of the Lord, submit
    yourselves to every human authority - whether to the emperor as being
    supreme, or to governors as being sent by him to punish wrongdoers and praise
    those who do what is good.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures cited herein are unambiguous that God commanded the Israelites
    to eat matzah on each of the seven days of the Feast of unleavened
    bread that begins on the 15 th day of Nisan .
    The rationale for it appears to be to remember the Israelites'' hasty
    departure from Egypt by eating bread similar to the kind they carried with
    them - bread that did not have time to rise during their travel. This
    translates to being a mandate today for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles, but not for other Gentiles, although they may do so (if they are so
    moved) in identification with the Jewish people.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures are clear that we are not to entice anyone into idolatry.
    Although they refer to physical idols and false gods, Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 consider anything to be a "god" or an idol that
    competes with the one true God by becoming man''s master or that we put ahead
    of the one true God in any other way. Such idols can be money, sexual
    immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, property, power, security, greed,
    and others. Consequently, anyone who entices others to pursue such things is
    guilty of violating the Scriptures that underlie this Mitzvah .'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is clear from the totality of the Scriptures (and especially from the New
    Covenant Scriptures), that the overarching commandment is for men to love
    their wives. The particulars of this Mitzvah in singling out food,
    clothing, and marital (conjugal sexual) rights is forced upon us because it
    is treated that way by the classical commentators, and we felt that we should
    respond accordingly. Many Scriptures address men but are clearly applicable
    to both men and women. We understand that wives are to love their husbands
    but the responsibility of this Mitzvah is directed specifically to
    husbands.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is a form of charity known in the Jewish world as tz''dakah . It speaks to the worker directly, but implies a clear duty
    on the part of the owner of crops to allow his workers to eat of them while
    they are at work. One may argue that this also applies to those who work
    among food items which are not crops. For example, a restaurant worker may
    eat his fill during his or her work shift, but may not take any of it home.
    Also, because the Mitzvah is clearly one of compassion for the poor,
    in modern times it extends to industries that provide human necessaries other
    than edibles such as medical care, medicine, clothing basics, and fuel. It
    seems to me that if one hires an unshod shoe salesman, it is inhumane and a
    violation of 1 John 3:17 to require that he sell shoes while not
    equipping him with a pair of his own.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Scripture commands us to know God, but we cannot know Him without knowing
    something about who He is. It is true of humans as well. We can know
    everything about a person and still not know him because knowing a person
    requires that there be a relationship; if there is none, then we do not
    really know him. Scripture exhorts us to know God by having an intimate and
    personal relationship with Him; for example: John 17:3 : And eternal life is this: to know you, the one
    true God, and him whom you sent, Yeshua the Messiah. 1 John 4:8 : Those who do not love do not know God; because
    God is love. Indeed, Scripture tells us that God is our heavenly father; but, do we relate
    to Him as a father? One test is whether we relate to Him as we do (or should
    do) our earthly father. We talk to our earthly father. Do we talk to God? We
    listen when our earthly father speaks. Do we hear God when He talks to us?
    Ideally, we love our earthly father (and mother) because they gave birth to
    us and first loved us. God gave birth to us through His creation and 1
    John 4:19 says: We ourselves love now because he loved us first. Loving God is foundational to our having a personal relationship with Him,
    and we cannot love God without knowing Him, and cannot know Him without
    knowing who He is. How do we know who God (in fact any person) is? We have
    to spend time with a person to know who he or she is, and it is no less true
    of God. If this Mitzvah causes us to evaluate whether we spend enough
    time with God to know who God is, then it has done its job. It is important that we know how to spend time with a God whom we cannot see.
    First, we can converse with God. If we are a believer, we know that God
    hears us when we speak to Him, but what is sometimes more challenging is
    hearing Him when He speaks to us. For those of us that confess that we rarely
    hear God or do not hear God at all, I would say that the first step in our
    hearing Him is our believing that we can. Our ability to know God through conversing with Him is a foundational
    attribute and empowerment of the New Covenant; we read in Jeremiah
    31:32-33(33-34) : "For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra''el after
    those days," says ADONAI: "I will put my Torah within them and write it on
    their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will
    any of them teach his fellow community member or his brother [to] ''Know
    ADONAI''; for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
    because I will forgive their wickednesses and remember their sins no
    more." God says that the New Covenant he will make with the Israelites will result
    in everyone who is party to it knowing Him as Lord and, to achieve it, He
    will put the Torah within each of us, and write it on each of our
    hearts. I have no doubt that the Israelites of old who heard Jeremiah speak
    his prophesy did not have a clear understanding of how God would bring it to
    pass, but we now know that He did it by sending the Holy Spirit to indwell
    those of us who receive him. For that reason, knowing God must involve the
    Holy Spirit for, without the Holy Spirit, we are out of communication with
    both Yeshua and the Father, and therefore out of communication with God. God has graciously provided us with help for our getting to know Him, and
    that help is the Bible that tell us about Him - ergo , the Scriptures
    quoted in this Mitzvah about knowing Him. We must keep in mind,
    however, that knowing God (which is the goal) is different from knowing about
    Him, but knowing about Him helps us to know Him. Here are two Scriptures
    that exhort us to have knowledge about Him: Ephesians 1:16-17 : I have not stopped giving thanks for you.
    In my prayers I keep asking the God of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, the
    glorious Father, to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you
    will have full knowledge of him. Colossians 1:9-10 :&nbosp Therefore, from the day we heard of it,
    we have not stopped praying for you, asking God to fill you with the
    knowledge of his will in all the wisdom and understanding which the Spirit
    gives; so that you may live lives worthy of the Lord and entirely pleasing to
    him, being fruitful in every good work and multiplying in the full knowledge
    of God. While these Scriptures exhort us to have knowledge of God, they do not
    themselves give us that knowledge. I therefore refer the reader of this Mitzvah to the above list of God''s many attributes. The list tells us
    who God is and, interestingly, most of the items on it tell us who we should
    be as well. We achieve those attributes by putting off our old selves, and
    modeling our new selves after Yeshua ( Ephesians 4:22-24 ).'
- id: J001
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah was written to explain God''s expectation of us in the New
    Covenant, and how to apply His commandments today that were given under the
    Mosaic Covenant. Although many Mosaic commandments are impossible or
    imprudent to comply with literally today, 2 Timothy 3:16 assures us
    that all of them are valuable in some way: All Scripture is God-breathed and is valuable for teaching the truth,
    convicting of sin, correcting faults and training in right living The reason that some of the commandments given under Moses cannot be complied
    with today is that they were constructed for a covenant that has been
    replaced (or has almost been replaced) by a New Covenant that is very
    different: Jeremiah 31:30-31(31-32) "'' Here, the days are coming,'' says ADONAI, ''when I will make a new covenant
    with the house of Isra''el and with the house of Y''hudah. It will not be like
    the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by their hand
    and brought them out of the land of Egypt; because they, for their part,
    violated my covenant, even though I, for my part, was a husband to them,''
    says ADONAI. " Hebrews 8:13 By using the term, "new", he has made the first covenant "old"; and
    something being made old, something in the process of aging, is on its way to
    vanishing altogether. Today''s conditions are changed. We no longer have the Tabernacle or Temple,
    there is no longer a functioning Levitical priesthood or Levitical High
    Priest and, even if we rebuilt the Temple and reinstalled Levitical priests,
    most of the sacrifices required by the Mosaic Law would be unauthorized
    because Yeshua is now our sacrifice for sin and our High Priest: Hebrews 10:10-13 It is in connection with this will that we have been separated for God and
    made holy, once and for all, through the offering of Yeshua the Messiah''s
    body. Now every cohen stands every day doing his service, offering over and
    over the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this one,
    after he had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at
    the right hand of God, from then on to wait until his enemies be made a
    footstool for his feet. Hebrews 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great cohen gadol who has passed through to
    the highest heaven, Yeshua, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we
    acknowledge as true. Hebrews 7:17-27 For it is stated, "You are a cohen FOREVER, to be compared with
    Malki-Tzedek." Thus, on the one hand, the earlier rule is set aside because
    of its weakness and inefficacy (for the Torah did not bring anything to the
    goal); and, on the other hand, a hope of something better is introduced,
    through which we are drawing near to God. What is more, God swore an oath.
    For no oath was sworn in connection with those who become cohanim now; but
    Yeshua became a cohen by the oath which God swore when he said to him,
    "ADONAI has sworn and will not change his mind, ''You are a cohen
    forever.''" Also this shows how much better is the covenant of which
    Yeshua has become guarantor. Moreover, the present cohanim are many in
    number, because they are prevented by death from continuing in office. But
    because he lives forever, his position as cohen does not pass on to someone
    else; and consequently, he is totally able to deliver those who approach God
    through him; since he is alive forever and thus forever able to intercede on
    their behalf. This is the kind of cohen gadol that meets our need - holy,
    without evil, without stain, set apart from sinners and raised higher than
    the heavens; one who does not have the daily necessity, like the other
    cohanim g''dolim, of offering up sacrifices first for their own sins and
    only then for those of the people; because he offered one sacrifice, once and
    for all, by offering up himself. Attempting to apply statutory laws in a literal way when the result is
    improper or does not make sense is what is called "legalism", and it is
    warned against in Scripture: Romans 6:14-15 For sin will not have authority over you; because you are not under
    legalism but under grace. Therefore, what conclusion should we reach? "Let''s
    go on sinning, because we''re not under legalism but under grace"? Heaven
    forbid! Galatians 3:10-12 For everyone who depends on legalistic observance of Torah commands lives
    under a curse, since it is written, ''Cursed is everyone who does not keep on
    doing everything written in the Scroll of the Torah.'' Now it is evident that
    no one comes to be declared righteous by God through legalism, since ''The
    person who is righteous will attain life by trusting and being faithful.''
    Furthermore, legalism is not based on trusting and being faithful, but on [a
    misuse of] the text that says, ''Anyone who does these things will attain life
    through them.'' So, the question remains: How do we apply the Scriptural commandments of the Torah that seem undoable today? The answer is different for every
    commandment and for every situation in which we find ourselves, and the New
    Covenant Scriptures tells us how; it is to consult and be led by the Holy
    Spirit: John 14:26 But the Counselor, the Ruach HaKodesh, whom the Father will send in my
    name, will teach you everything; that is, he will remind you of everything I
    have said to you. Romans 7:6 But now we have been released from this aspect of the Torah, because we
    have died to that which had us in its clutches, so that we are serving in the
    new way provided by the Spirit and not in the old way of outwardly following
    the letter of the law. Romans 8:1-2 Therefore, there is no longer any condemnation awaiting those who are in
    union with the Messiah Yeshua. Why? Because the Torah of the Spirit, which
    produces this life in union with Messiah Yeshua, has set me free from the
    "Torah" of sin and death. Romans 8:14 All who are led by God''s Spirit are God''s sons. Notwithstanding the importance of being led by the Spirit, it is sometimes
    helpful to group literally undoable commandments by subject category and
    consider their significance and application collectively. What follows is a
    list of such subject categories along with suggested applications, and one or
    two Scripture examples for each: Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Require the Holy Tabernacle, Temple, or
    Place that God Chooses Scriptures that Assume an Operative Levitical

    that God Chooses Exodus 25:8 They are to make me a sanctuary, so that I may live among them. Deuteronomy 12:21 If the place which ADONAI your God chooses to place his name is too far
    away from you; then you are to slaughter animals from your cattle or sheep,
    which ADONAI has given you; and eat on your own property, as much as you
    want. The Holy Tabernacle, the Temple, and other special places designated by God
    were not only places in which to conduct sacrifices, but also where the glory
    of God dwelt on earth, and where men (who were authorized) could encounter
    God intimately and powerfully. Chapters 40 to 48 of Ezekiel prophesy
    the detailed rebuilding of a Temple that is mysterious as to its identity,
    function, and when it is to happen (or has happened). Some scholars believe
    that the passage is a commandment for the Jewish people to rebuild God''s
    Temple. Most significant, however, is that the place where God chooses to
    place his name is a foreshadowing of the New Covenant''s visitation of the
    Holy Spirit who has come to live within all men that are willing to receive
    Him: 1 Corinthians 6:19a Or don''t you know that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who
    lives inside you, whom you received from God? Also, 1 Corinthians 3:16 shows that the corporate body of Messiah is
    also a Temple of the Spirit today: Don''t you know that you people are God''s temple and that God''s Spirit
    lives in you? This is anticipated by John 4:23-24 where worship in spirit and in
    truth transcends a particular temple location: But the time is coming - indeed, it''s here now - when the true
    worshippers will worship the Father spiritually and truly, for these are the
    kind of people the Father wants worshipping him. God is spirit; and
    worshippers must worship him spiritually and truly. Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Assume an Operative Levitical Priesthood Leviticus 8:1-4 ADONAI said to Moshe, ''Take Aharon and his sons with him, the garments,
    the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket
    of matzah; and assemble the entire community at the entrance to the tent of
    meeting.'' Moshe did as ADONAI ordered him, and the community was assembled
    at the entrance to the tent of meeting. The above Scripture speaks of the ordination of Aaron and his sons as
    Levitical priests, and Aaron as High Priest. A significant value of the
    Scriptures concerning Levitical priests, is that they teach us what the
    functions of a priest and priesthood should be and, although the Levitical
    priesthood is no longer operative, other priesthoods are. The people of
    Israel are said, in Scripture, to be a kingdom of priests
    ( Exodus 19:6 ). Also, 1 Peter 2:4-5 defines a priesthood of
    believers in Yeshua, and Hebrews 4:14-16 establishes Yeshua as the New
    Covenant''s High Priest. God has New Covenant priestly expectations of
    Israelites (today referred to as Jews) and of all believers in Yeshua - not
    to conduct sacrifices - but to prayerfully intercede for others, teach,
    counsel, and otherwise serve our fellow man. Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Call for Punishment Exodus 22:2b-3(3b-4) A thief must make restitution; so if he has nothing, he himself is to be
    sold to make good the loss from the theft. If what he stole is found alive
    in his possession, he is to pay double, no matter whether it is an ox, a
    donkey or a sheep. Exodus 31:13-15 Tell the people of Isra''el, ''You are to observe my Shabbats; for this is
    a sign between me and you through all your generations; so that you will know# that I am ADONAI, who sets you apart for me. Therefore you are to keep my
    Shabbat, because it is set apart for you. Everyone who treats it as ordinary
    must be put to death; for whoever does any work on it is to be cut off from
    his people. On six days work will get done; but the seventh day is Shabbat,
    for complete rest, set apart for ADONAI. Whoever does any work on the day of
    Shabbat must be put to death. Leviticus 24:19-20 If someone injures his neighbor, what he did is to be done to him - break
    for break, eye for eye, tooth for tooth - whatever injury he has caused the
    other person is to be rendered to him in return. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 If a man has a stubborn, rebellious son who will not obey what his father
    or mother says, and even after they discipline him he still refuses to pay
    attention to them; then his father and mother are to take hold of him and
    bring him out to the leaders of his town, at the gate of that place, and say
    to the leaders of his town, ''This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, he
    doesn''t pay attention to us, lives wildly, gets drunk.'' Then all the men of
    his town are to stone him to death; in this way you will put an end to such
    wickedness among you, and all Isra''el will hear about it and be afraid. Leviticus 24:19-20 declares that "eye for eye, tooth for tooth" is the
    Mosaic standard of punishment for causing personal injury to another.
    Expanding the principle to other kinds of infractions, one is reminded of a
    quote from W.S. Gilbert''s The Mikado : "Let the punishment fit the
    crime." Sensible as these standards for punishment may seem, they are rarely
    employed by today''s secular governments that tend to not allow creative
    discretion to judges. The Scriptures requiring execution and other extreme punishments of those who
    violate certain biblical commandments are often shocking because, by today''s
    standards, many of the offenses that called for death and other severe
    punishments during the time of Moses are not even considered crimes today. We
    no longer stone our rebellious and drunkard sons, nor do we put to death
    those who violate the Sabbath and, should we attempt to do so, we would be in
    violation of the laws of the secular governments under which we live. During the time of Moses, the Israelites lived under a theocracy that was
    governed directly by God and today, we do not. Torah for us today, is
    ancient law that we read about in the Bible in order to understand its
    principles. For the Israelites under Moses, however, it was contemporary law
    that was spoken by God directly to them from Mount Sinai. For the Israelites
    to disobey that which God commanded them in so personal a way would have been
    a direct "slap in the face" of God, and worthy of the severe punishments that
    we read about. There are also offenses in the Torah for which punishments are not
    severe by today''s standards, but which, nevertheless, cannot be applied
    without transgressing today''s secular laws. For example, Exodus
    22:2b-3(3b-4) directs that a thief must pay double restitution for what
    he has stolen, and he must be sold as a laborer (a slave) if he cannot afford
    to pay. On the surface, double restitution seems fair and doable, but it is
    not enforceable because the secular laws under which we live do not allow for
    it, and slave labor is, of course, a violation of the secular law. For us, the main value of the various punishments we read about in the
    Scriptures is that they give us an understanding of the seriousness with
    which God considers certain kinds of wrongful conduct. In today''s world,
    capital punishment of a rebellious son would not be allowed. Yet, God
    considers rebellion and stubbornness so serious a sin that we read in 1
    Samuel 15:23 : For rebellion is like the sin of sorcery, stubbornness like the crime of
    idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of ADONAI, he too has rejected
    you as king. It is also of interest to note that, except for captives in war, nothing in
    the Mosaic Law authorizes imprisonment as a punishment; yet, imprisonment is
    the principle form of punishment employed by secular governments today.
    Really, imprisonment as a punishment is a blunt instrument because it does
    not promote heart-felt repentance. For non-capital offenses, restoration
    through community service and paying back offended persons (and then some) is
    much more redemptive. What is more, being imprisoned with other offenders
    often brings greater criminality that is acted out upon the prisoner''s
    release - the opposite of that which is intended. Societies should take this
    into account in constructing their systems of law. Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Pertain to the Government of Ancient Israel Exodus 30:13-14 Everyone subject to the census is to pay as an offering to ADONAI half a
    shekel [one-fifth of an ounce of silver] - by the standard of the sanctuary
    shekel (a shekel equals twenty gerahs). Everyone over twenty years of age
    who is subject to the census is to give this offering to ADONAI Deuteronomy 1:17 You are not to show favoritism when judging, but give equal attention to
    the small and to the great. No matter how a person presents himself, don''t be
    afraid of him; because the decision is God''s. The case that is too hard for
    you, bring to me and I will hear it. The Scriptures quoted could be complied with if one were a citizen of Israel
    under Moses, but could not (and cannot) be complied with under other
    governments. Still, they have teaching value. For example, the Exodus Scripture teaches us that there is a government''s need to know how many
    residents occupy its country, and the Deuteronomy Scripture
    establishes standards for judging legal cases, except that today, cases that
    are removed from a lower court are sent to a higher court - not to Moses.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Psalm 4:4(3) says: " You can be angry, but do not sin! ", and
    similarly, Ephesians 4:26 says: " Be angry, but don''t sin. "
    Clearly, anger itself is not sinful, but what we do as a result of our anger
    often is, and that is why there are so many Scriptures that warn us against
    anger. Notice that both of the Scriptures above command us to not sin as a
    result of our anger - a comforting reminder that we can control our anger,
    and not sin on account of it. Anger can be directed toward a circumstance or even against our self, but
    this Mitzvah has to do with anger directed against a person (our
    neighbor), that we allow to persist. That, Matthew 5:22 says is sin,
    and Ephesians 4:26-27 says that we must not let the sun go down on our
    anger which means that in order to avoid sin, any anger we have toward our
    neighbor must be short-lived.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Chametz is any food that contains leaven, the quintessential one being
    bread leavened with yeast. This Mitzvah states that we must not eat chametz , from Passover through the seventh day of the Feast of
    Unleavened Bread. Each of the supporting Scriptures above states it a little
    differently. Exodus 13:3 instructs abstention from chametz , Exodus 12:19-20 prohibits eating food that contains chametz ,
    and Deuteronomy 16:2-3 prohibits eating chametz along with the
    sacrificed Passover lamb, all of which amount to the same thing which is to
    not eat chametz during the seven days of Unleavened Bread. The particulars of what should be considered leaven and chametz are
    controversial among Jewry. Sephardic and Ashkenazic communities follow
    different rules on the subject, and Messianic Jewish communities are equally
    diverse. Is leaven anything that can cause food to rise, or must there be
    fermentation in order for it to qualify? What grains must be removed from the
    house because they are subject to spontaneous fermentation during storage?
    Rice? Barley? Beans? Discussions of such particulars are found in the Talmudic literature, but not in any of the classical mitzvah codifications. I do not think it would be judicious for me to express my
    opinion of these particulars here. The general idea in the Scriptures is
    that the Israelites'' bread that would otherwise have fermented with yeast did
    not have time to rise. Therefore, a commonly held view that our not keeping
    casually-stored grains that would have had time to ferment and rise is what
    Scripture intends. An alternative view discounts the effect of airborne yeast
    and calls for discarding only those items that contain added leaven. The
    commercially prepared foods found in today''s homes pose a special problem of
    identification in that some contain leaven where you would not expect it.
    Soups, for example, often contain yeast. My personal practice is to read all
    of the labels on packaged and canned foods and discard those that contain the
    words "leaven" or "yeast". This Mitzvah is mandated for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles,
    but not for Gentiles generally. Exodus 12:19-20 makes this clear in
    that most Gentiles were not part of the community of Israel in the first
    place, so their being cut off from it for eating chametz is
    meaningless.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah prohibits excluding Gentiles from Jewish communities. A
    Jewish community that is the kind of which I am speaking has Jewish members,
    governing and pastoral leaders, organized prayer that is culturally Jewish,
    Bible and/or Torah studies, table fellowship, an adherence to biblical halachah as it applies to Jews, and a shared Jewish style of life.
    Even a casual perusal of the Scriptures presented in this Mitzvah will
    demonstrate that, throughout Jewish history, there have always been Gentiles
    that resided alongside, and participated with, their Jewish brothers within
    Jewish communities. So close was the communal relationship between Jews and gerim (committed Gentiles) during the Mosaic Covenant era, that God
    provided for there to be an inheritance of land given to Gentiles that was
    within the territory of a tribe with whom a Gentile was living ( Ezekiel
    47:21-23 ). The relationship gets even closer in the New Covenant where, according to Romans 11:16-18 , Gentile believers in Yeshua become connected to their
    Messianic Jewish brothers and to the Jewish people globally by figuratively
    being grafted into, and becoming branches on, a cultivated olive tree that is
    owned by Israel (the Jewish people): Now if the hallah offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole loaf.
    And if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches
    were broken off, and you - a wild olive - were grafted in among them and have
    become equal sharers in the rich root of the olive tree, then don''t boast as
    if you were better than the branches! However, if you do boast, remember that
    you are not supporting the root, the root is supporting you. We know that the olive tree into which Gentile believers are grafted belongs
    to Israel because we read in Romans 11:24 : For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree and
    grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will
    these natural branches be grafted back into their [Israel''s] own olive
    tree! What is more, we read in Ephesians 2:11-14 : Therefore, remember your former state: you Gentiles by birth - called the
    Uncircumcised by those who, merely because of an operation on their flesh,
    are called the Circumcised - at that time had no Messiah. You were estranged
    from the national life of Isra''el. [Commonwealth of Israel in the New King
    James translation] You were foreigners to the covenants embodying God''s
    promise. You were in this world without hope and without God. But now, you
    who were once far off have been brought near through the shedding of the
    Messiah''s blood. For he himself is our shalom - he has made us both one and
    has broken down the m''chitzah [middle wall of separation] which divided us
    ... Another reason that Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish communities
    is the matter of table fellowship and hospitality of Jews to Gentiles that is
    exemplified in the following Scriptures: John 4:7-10 A woman from Shomron [ a Gentile ] came to draw some water; and
    Yeshua said to her, "Give me a drink of water." (His talmidim had gone into
    town to buy food.) The woman from Shomron said to him, "How is it that you,
    a Jew, ask for water from me, a woman of Shomron?" (For Jews don''t associate
    with people from Shomron.) Yeshua answered her, "If you knew God''s gift,
    that is, who it is saying to you, ''Give me a drink of water,'' then you would
    have asked him; and he would have given you living water." Acts 10:25-28 As Kefa entered the house, Cornelius [ a Gentile ] met him and fell
    prostrate at his feet. But Kefa pulled him to his feet and said, "Stand up!
    I myself am just a man." As he talked with him, Kefa went inside and found
    many people gathered. He said to them, "You are well aware that for a man
    who is a Jew to have close association with someone who belongs to another
    people, or to come and visit him, is something that just isn''t done. But God
    has shown me not to call any person common or unclean" Hebrews 13:2 (NAS) Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers [ presumably includes
    Gentiles ], for by this some have entertained angels without knowing
    it. Still another reason that Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish
    communities is the application of Matthew 7:12 (see also, Luke
    6:31 ): Always treat others as you would like them to treat you; that sums up the
    teaching of the Torah and the Prophets. And even another (and perhaps the best) reason for Jews to not exclude
    Gentiles from their communities is that it is God''s plan for Jews and
    Gentiles to worship side-by-side at the end of times. We see this in Revelation 7:9-10 : After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for
    anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language [ Jews &
    Gentiles ]. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the
    Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands; and
    they shouted, "Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the
    Lamb!" Would we think it proper for a Gentile community to exclude Jews? There were
    many such communities in the United States in the past, but thankfully there
    no longer are - at least officially. While Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish congregations and other
    Jewish community entities, there are some situations where Jews caucusing
    with Jews may be appropriate - a Jewish discussion group on Jewish topics for
    example. I do believe it is important for Jewish disciples of Yeshua to
    fellowship in communities where their Jewish identities, life patterns, and
    covenant responsibilities are encouraged. For that reason, Gentiles that
    join and commit themselves to a Messianic Jewish congregation should adopt
    the congregation''s Jewish ways of being, and not try to influence it to
    become Christian in culture. That notwithstanding, some aspects of Torah apply differently to Jews and Gentiles. Perhaps this Mitzvah can best be summarized by Psalms 133:1 : Oh, how good, how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in
    harmony. In the New Covenant, Jewish and Gentile believers in Yeshua are brothers and
    sisters in the Lord and should therefore live together in harmony wherever
    they choose to worship. 1 1. Daniel C. Juster, Jewish Roots: A

  commentary_rudolph: 'The first thing to notice is that one should not consider himself a creditor
    when one lends money to a poor brother ( Exodus 24(25) ). Scripture
    establishes a different standard when the loan is to a brother Jew and
    especially if it is for compassionate reasons. This is clear in the
    Scriptures that deny interest to the lender and limit his collection options.
    Notice also that the lender is to treat the borrower so as to preserve both
    his safety and dignity, as we see in Deuteronomy 24:10-13 which
    prohibits the lender from entering the borrower''s house to remove collateral,
    and requires that the lender return needed collateral to him at night. Notice
    also that importance is given to maintaining the borrower''s good relationship
    with the lender and his having gratitude for the lender''s compassion in
    having concern for his welfare. The lender has no recourse of collection against a brother for a debt which
    the brother is unable to pay, but such is not the case with a loan made to a
    foreigner. In making a loan to a foreigner, interest may be charged and
    collection means employed if the loan is defaulted upon. Nevertheless,
    compassionate justice is due everyone, including the foreigner, so the
    overall torah of this Mitzvah is that we are not to deal
    harshly or unreasonably when lending money, or collecting debts from anyone. As with other mitzvot , that date back to the Mosaic period, the
    foreigner or stranger was the Gentile who was not part of the camp of Israel,
    and was most likely an idol-worshipper. With the New Covenant, Gentile
    believers in Yeshua become brothers and members of the commonwealth (national
    life) of Israel through grafting into the olive tree ( Romans 11:17 ; Ephesians 2:12 ), so this mitzvah and others like it should
    apply to them as though they are Jews. It is fairly easy to apply this Mitzvah when a loan is made by and
    individual to an individual. However, in this day and age, many loans are
    not personal but rather corporate, and in such case the Mitzvah is
    difficult to apply. Consider, for example, the plight of a Jewish bank
    officer who facilitates his bank''s loan to another Jew and, when the loan is
    defaulted upon, called to foreclose on the borrower''s house in order to
    collect the loan. Since the bank officer does not own the loan and is duty
    bound to represent his employer''s interest, it is my opinion that he can
    participate in the foreclosure after making every effort to help the borrower
    solve his financial difficulty.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The undeniable weight of Scripture is that we are to always acknowledge our
    belief in God and in Yeshua the Messiah, and never deny it. Denial can be
    by lying or through silence that is misleading. The most common reasons
    that men deny their faith in God or Messiah are fear or to gain some
    advantage. Temptations to deny our faith predate the Torah itself. Consider how
    Job was consistently urged to curse God, but he did not. That book was
    preserved for us in Scripture, that we might follow Job''s example when hard
    times, danger, or even benefit befall us where logic and common expectation
    tells us that we will fare better and safer if we lie or mislead someone
    about our Messianic faith. The story of Job is one of success. Centuries
    later, the story of Peter is one of failure, as he denied that he knew
    Yeshua and that he was one of Yeshua''s disciples - not once, but three
    times. The temptation to deny the Lord can be subtle, and can come in many forms.
    Usually it comes from someone we want to please or someone we do not want to
    anger. It can occur when a co-worker blasphemes the name of the Lord and we
    do not (at the very least) walk away. It can occur when our employer makes
    a rude remark about the Lord''s chosen people and we do not correct him or
    admit that we are one of them. It can occur when we go along with a joke
    that mocks marriage, sex, or other things that the Lord gave us and cares
    about deeply. It can occur when we hold back from witnessing to our
    parents, or when, as Jews, we acquiesce to eating treyf in order to
    be social. It can occur when we mislead another about our belief in Yeshua
    in our attempt to pursue Jewish conversion or apply for aliyah to
    Israel. The Scriptures cannot be clearer, from the earliest in the Tanakh to
    the most recent in the B''rit Chadasha . The mitzvot to wear
    fringes (and by traditional understanding phylacteries) for all to see, to
    display m''zuzot on one''s doorposts (again for all to see), and to
    cleave to God and love Him with all of our heart, being, and resources, are
    the antithesis of denying Him. Regarding Yeshua, the New Covenant Scriptures make it very clear that our
    responsibility is to preach the Good News of His Messiahship, and that there
    are dire consequences if we hide it or deny it.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is not possible for a man to bear no fruit at all. By merely being alive,
    man will bear either good fruit or bad fruit, and Scripture makes it plain
    that the choice is ours. Only good fruit results from our abiding in (being
    united with) Yeshua, and he is quoted to have said: " apart from me you
    can''t do a thing. " That is not to say that isolated instances of good fruit can never come from
    a person who is not united with Yeshua or that God cannot work His will
    through an unbeliever. However, Scripture is exhorting us that if we want to
    bear good fruit for God we must be (and remain) united with Yeshua, and then
    (and only then) will good fruit from us be assured.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'There is a children''s rhyme: "Sticks and stones may break my bones but words
    can never harm me." It is taught to children as a lesson that they should
    not retaliate against name-calling, but the weight of Scripture teaches that
    the rhyme is not true. Indeed, without interfering with its intended lesson,
    the rhyme should rather state: "Sticks and stones may break my bones but
    words can hurt me deeply." The greater lesson of the substitute rhyme and of
    Scripture is that we must guard our tongue to ensure its use for good and
    holiness, and not for harm. There is a rabbinical halachah against lashon hara , (negative
    speech) - literally "evil or bad tongue" - that is inspired by Leviticus
    19:16 (see also, Ephesians 4:29 and James 4:11 ). The halachah prohibits speaking negatively about a person, regardless of
    the truth of what is said, and it also prohibits listening to or believing
    such negative statements. It is regrettable that a number of English
    translations of Leviticus 19:16 render the Hebrew noun
    " rachiyl " as "slander" because the English word "slander" connotes
    both negativity and untruthfulness. " Rachiyl ", on the other hand,
    connotes negativity, but not necessarily untruthfulness, so a better
    translation of " rachiyl " is "negative report". Speaking negatively about a person invariably harms him in some way, and
    bringing harm to a person (except when sanctioned legally) is always wrong.
    It is egregious to God, and especially so if the lashon hara is
    against a leader that God Himself has set in office. That which happened to
    Miryam when she murmured against Moses is the quintessential example of how
    serious a sin it is; we read about it in Numbers 12:1-2 and 6-10 : Miryam and Aharon began criticizing Moshe on account of the Ethiopian
    woman he had married, for he had in fact married an Ethiopian woman. They
    said, "Is it true that ADONAI has spoken only with Moshe? Hasn''t he spoken
    with us too?" ADONAI heard them. He said, "Listen to what I say: when there is a prophet among you, I, ADONAI,
    make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. But it
    isn''t that way with my servant Moshe. He is the only one who is faithful in
    my entire household. With him I speak face to face and clearly, not in
    riddles; he sees the image of ADONAI. So why weren''t you afraid to criticize
    my servant Moshe?" The anger of ADONAI flared up against them, and he left.
    But when the cloud was removed from above the tent, Miryam had tzara''at,
    [leprosy] as white as snow. Aharon looked at Miryam, and she was as white as
    snow. Miryam and Aaron speaking against Moses and the grumbling referred to in James 5:9 are similar. Matthew 5 and Matthew 18 are relevant to the subject of
    wrongful speech because speech so often causes (or is the result of) human
    conflicts. Matthew 5 speaks to the offender, and Matthew 18 to
    the offended and, in both cases, the required initial action is to hold our
    tongue, not speak negatively about our brother to others, and go to the
    person with whom we have the conflict. It is only after there has been no
    success at reconciliation that others may become involved, and then, only in
    a controlled manner. The second and final attempts at reconciliation Matthew 18:16 & 17 are parts of an authorized judicial process that
    begins with mediation, and culminates in adjudication. Whatever is spoken
    before witnesses at these two "judicial" sessions is considered testimony,
    and is therefore exempt from the restrictions of lashon hara . Uttering a curse against a person or against God is speech that intends harm,
    is wrongful, and is prohibited.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Exodus 12:3-8 gives details of the first Passover that occurred on the

    calendar), the evening before the Israelites were led out of Egypt. God
    subsequently commanded the Israelites to keep the Passover as an annual

    between sundown and complete darkness. On the original Passover in Egypt, the Israelites were instructed to eat a
    sacrificed lamb with matzah and bitter herbs ( maror ). Numbers 9:10-11 is significant here because, by commanding Passover
    observance a month late under certain circumstances, the point is made that
    Passover is to be kept each year as a lasting ordinance; it was not just a
    one-time event. Lambs were sacrificed on Passover until the destruction of the Second Temple,
    after which, animal sacrifice could no longer be done. Even had the Temple
    not been destroyed, it is doubtful that the Passover sacrifice would have
    continued among the Jewish followers of Yeshua because they understood Him to
    be their "once and for all" sacrificed lamb. On the other hand, they might
    have partaken of it as part of a memorial to Yeshua, since we see Paul and
    other disciples engaged in Temple sacrifices long after the time of Yeshua''s
    death ( Acts 21 ). What remains of Passover observance for Jews today,
    is that we partake of a seder meal on the evening of Nisan 14,
    during which we eat lamb if we are Sephardic (we do not if we are Ashkenaz),
    unleavened bread and maror (bitter herbs), and we abstain from eating
    (or even possessing) leaven. The Sephardim look at the eating of lamb
    differently from the Ashkenazim. The Sephardim eat it in remembrance of the
    sacrificed Passover lamb, and the Ashkenazim abstain so that no one can
    interpret it as constituting a present day sacrifice. There was one Passover meal (described in Matthew 26:26 , Mark
    14:22 , and Luke 22:19 ), at which Yeshua picked up a piece of matzah from the table, broke it, and gave it to the twelve disciples
    who were with Him, to eat and make a memory they would later use as a
    memorial of His body that was be broken during the sacrifice He was about
    to endure. This, along with the wine He also spoke of, I consider to be a
    new commandment to His disciples (present and future - Jew and Gentile). Observing the Passover (without sacrificing a lamb) is mandatory for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. It is optional for other Gentiles who may
    also want to observe it (albeit in some adaptive manner) as a way of
    identifying with the Jewish People, and also as an acknowledgement of
    Passover''s prophetic significance that points to Yeshua. Over the centuries,
    various Jewish halachic practices have developed that define how
    Passover is observed in Jewish communities. Gentiles who choose to observe
    Passover may borrow from these, but are free to depart as well, and to
    develop their own customs and expressions. It should be noted that the
    historic churches sometimes call the period from Good Friday to Resurrection
    Sunday "Passover" ( Pascha ) and do keep it to a degree, but usually
    without adequate reference to its Exodus roots. Finally, a word needs to be said about the prohibition to Gentiles recorded
    in Exodus 12:43-49 : ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon, "This is the regulation for the Pesach
    lamb: no foreigner is to eat it. But if anyone has a slave he bought for
    money, when you have circumcised him, he may eat it. Neither a traveler nor
    a hired servant may eat it. It is to be eaten in one house. You are not to
    take any of the meat outside the house, and you are not to break any of its
    bones. The whole community of Isra''el is to keep it. If a foreigner staying
    with you wants to observe ADONAI''s Pesach, all his males must be circumcised.
    Then he may take part and observe it; he will be like a citizen of the land.
    But no uncircumcised person is to eat it. The same teaching is to apply
    equally to the citizen and to the foreigner living among you." This prohibition only applies to eating the sacrificed Passover lamb (which
    we no longer do). It does not apply to the other aspects of Passover
    observance, so Gentiles are completely free to attend and even conduct
    Passover sedarim .'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It should be apparent from the many Scriptures quoted above, that both the Tanakh and the Kitvey B''rit Chadasha enjoin us to be thankful
    to God, giving thanks to Him who created all and who continues to provide for
    our every need. There exists, however, only one place in the Torah that specifically commands thankfulness - Deuteronomy 8:6-18 , verse
    10 , which is the basis for the traditional Grace after Meals, the Birkat Hamazon . Notwithstanding that single occurrence, being
    thankful and giving thanks to God are deeply ingrained in Judaism and in
    Jewish practice. They are addressed in various places in the Talmud (e.g. in B''rakhot and Avot ), and appear in the Siddur as the first blessing that is said upon awakening ( Modeh
    Ani ), as the next-to-last benediction of the Sh''moneh Esreh (" Modim anachnu lach ... "), and as the central theme of the Aleinu prayer (" Va''anachnu korim umishtachavim umodim "). They
    are also implicit in the multitude of blessings that begin " Baruch atah
    adonai, eloheynu melech ha-olam ... " ("Blessed are you Lord, our God,
    King of the universe, who ..."). There are essentially two ways in which we can bless God. The first is by
    expressing thankful praise to Him for the blessings He bestows on us. It may
    be emoted spontaneously or recited ritually in what is termed a
    " b''rakhah ". The second way is by loving Him as our Heavenly Father,
    Messiah savior, and Holy Spirit, and by fulfilling His highest expectation of
    us, which is to be unswervingly obedient to His Word and to walk in His ways. The totality of Scripture makes it plain that our being thankful to God and
    our blessing Him should not be only for His provision of food, but for all of
    His provisions and blessings that He bestows upon us, not the least of which
    is His unconditional love. There is therefore a deeper way to understand and
    employ the Birkat Hamazon than as merely "grace after meals". It is
    that, in the fullness of our having eaten, we should allow its words to
    permeate our soul while contemplating our blessings, and thankfully
    remembering that God is our provider and sustainer, and not we ourselves.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Despite the numerous Scriptures in both the Tanakh and the Kitvey
    B''rit Chadasha that exemplify and exhort to worship, praise, and prayer,
    there is no explicit commandment in the Torah that requires any of
    them. The overall message of Scripture embracing them is unmistakable,
    however, so the early Rabbis and codifiers of the Law decided to list (in
    their mitzvah compilations) Scriptures that command giving service to
    God, and to treat "service" as encompassing prayer. I chose to do something
    similar in this Mitzvah by joining worship, praise, prayer, and
    service, and letting "worship" be the umbrella that encompasses the other
    three. Scripture (in particular Zechariah 4:6 , Romans 8:26-27 and Philippians 3:3 ) is clear that true worship and its components can
    only be entered into with the power and assistance of the Holy Spirit. If one understands worship as being a complete giving over of oneself to
    another, it is easy to see how praise, prayer, and service can be components
    of worship. It is not always the case, however; whether they are part of,
    and contribute to worship, depends upon the degree of "giving over", and
    their intensity. For example, merely complementing someone (praising him)
    does not constitute worship, and neither does asking an ordinary favor of
    someone (old English usage of praying), or serving someone as an employee.
    That notwithstanding, requesting something of a person while continuously
    praising him, showering him with unsolicited service, and pursuing him with
    an attitude of submission and adulation, may very constitute worship. In common modern usage, the word "prayer" is generally understood to mean
    petitioning God but, as I have indicated, in "old English" usage, it was a
    request made to anyone. For example, in Job 33:1 (rendered in the
    King James Version of the Bible) we read of God saying:: Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my
    words. God was certainly not "praying" to Job as we understand Job to have prayed to
    God. Serving another is similar, in that whether or not it constitutes worship
    depends upon the degree to which the service is rendered and the attitude
    that accomanies it. We read in 1 Peter 4:10 : As each one has received some spiritual gift, he should use it to serve
    others, like good managers of God''s many-sided grace. This exhortation to serve others is clearly not an invitation to worship
    them, whereas Yeshua''s answer to Satan in Luke 4:8 : The Tanakh says, ''Worship ADONAI your God and serve him only.'' illustrates how giving service to God does (and should) rise to the level of
    worship. Serving another with abandon (as a willing slave) is what
    constitutes worship, and it is only appropriate in our rendering service to
    God. An additional word concerning prayer: It has been taught, in certain
    circles, that Mark 11:24 (and similar Scriptures) can be used as a way
    of getting God to give us what we want, the theory being that, if we believe
    for something enough, God will give it to us. It is called "faith" by those
    who advance this view, but it is a mistake because true faith requires first
    hearing from God, and then believing and praying for what God wants - not for
    what we want - unless the two coincide. A Scripture that must be applied
    when interpreting Mark 11:24 is Jude 1:20 : But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith, and
    pray in union with the Ruach HaKodesh. Praying in union with the Holy Spirit is the key (see also, Hebrews
    11:1 ).'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures supporting this mitzvah appear to have three dissimilar
    themes: agriculture, marriage, and idolatry. What they all have in common,
    however, are sets of things that work in opposition to each other, causing a
    nullification of positive value that one of them alone might otherwise have
    had. First, the agricultural examples: (1) that we not yoke an ox and a donkey
    together to a plow, (2) that we not wear garments with wool and linen woven
    together, and (3) that we not sow two kinds of seeds in fields and in
    vineyards. The traditional explanation for not working two kinds of animals
    together is that it is cruel to the animals since the stronger of the two
    will drag the weaker one, and the weaker of the two will impede the stronger
    one. An additional observation offered here is that the work that either of
    the animals could do alone is impeded by their having to pull against each
    other. Maimonides'' explanation (echoed by HaChinuch) for not wearing wool and linen
    woven together is that such a fabric was worn by the heathen priests in
    Egypt. From a different point of view and the one I offer here is that wool
    and linen shrink different amounts after they are wet, so if they are woven
    together, they pull against each other when they dry and weaken the fabric. HaChinuch''s explanation for not sowing two kinds of seed is that it is an
    extension of the prohibition against mating mixed species. From a different
    point of view and the one I offer here is that different species of plants
    absorb nutrients from the soil in different proportions, so when they are
    planted close together they compete for the nutrients to the detriment of
    both. Consider the marriage examples next: 2 Corinthians 6:14-17 explains it
    best (although marriage is not mentioned in that Scripture) when it
    states: What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement
    can there be between the temple of God and idols? Without agreement on spiritual things between husband and wife, the husband
    cannot lead the wife, they pull in different directions, and destruction
    follows, sometimes with the believer compromising his or her faith. Finally, consider the idolatry examples: Israel was prohibited from making
    covenants with heathen nations and intermarrying with their sons and
    daughters for the same reason as was stated between believers and
    unbelievers. God predicted that if that happened, Israelites would be lured
    away from God and into idol worship, as He said in Deuteronomy 7:4 : For he will turn your children away from following me in order to serve
    other gods. Whereas, the classical commentators tend to interpret the Scriptures of this mitzvah according to the plain meaning of their words and separate
    from each other, I see them as connected by their common thread of forces
    pulling against each other. Clearly, the weight of this Mitzvah ''s
    application is that, if we belong to God, we must not yoke ourselves with
    anything or anyone who is not of God. Marriage is the most obvious example,
    followed perhaps by other partnerships like business partnerships. People
    who do not believe similarly about God hold different values, and take
    different ethical and moral positions on things. This either causes the
    believer to compromise, or it breaks up the partnership. As Matthew
    6:24 states: No one can be slave to two masters. If 2 Corinthians 6:14-17 were the only subject of this Mitzvah I could have given it the more narrow title "Being Unequally Yoked with
    Unbelievers". I did not, because but even in a partnership between two
    believers, the partnership is unwise if the partners see things very
    differently and respond accordingly. In this, the Scriptures have very
    far-reaching wisdom.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah brings together two Scriptures that, at first glance,
    have little in common. Deuteronomy 12:2-4 commands the Israelites to
    destroy all the places and objects used for idol-worship that they find among
    the heathen nations they are dispossessing; however, if in the process of
    doing so they come across places of worship and things belonging to HaShem - those they must not destroy. Eight chapters later, Deuteronomy 20:19-20 forbids the Israelites from destroying fruit
    trees while laying siege to a city. The connection between these seemingly unrelated Scriptures is the attribute
    of "holiness" as applied to the trees. God indeed wants places where
    idolatry is practiced and implements used there to be destroyed, but He does
    not want His holy places and things - things that belong to Him or that He
    provides as a blessing for men (like the fruit trees) to be destroyed in the
    process. Even when they have fallen into the hands of an enemy - holy things
    of God retain their holiness and must not be destroyed. Ephesians 4:29 illustrates this Mitzvah in a less tangible
    form: Let no harmful language come from your mouth, only good words that are
    helpful in meeting the need, words that will benefit those who hear them. Here the holy possession of God that we must not harm or destroy is our
    neighbor. The Scripture warns us that our words can be harmful to those who
    hear them, so we must speak only good and helpful words in order to not bring
    destruction to our neighbor who is God''s holy creation. Jewish halachah and tradition have long recognized the principle of
    preserving, and not destroying, things that belong to God and that are holy.
    An example is that we do not "trash" or tear up old Bibles, Torah scrolls or siddurim . Instead, there is a procedure whereby we
    ceremonially bury them in a way that is analogous to the way we bury a
    deceased
    person. 1 .
    I am also reminded of the way in which Leviticus 19:23-24 commands our
    holy respect for fruit-bearing trees. We do not eat their fruit during the
    first three years of their planting; the fourth year fruit is considered
    holy, and all of it must be used for praising God. It is only from the fifth
    year on that we may eat the fruit with an expectation of receiving its
    blessing year after year. Consider also, our "practical" respect for trees
    in Israel where we seek to plant them and not destroy them (e.g. Tu
    B''shvat ). By contrast, the Israel Defense Forces came under severe
    criticism for destroying olive trees in the process of clearing land for
    Israeli settlements. This Mitzvah is mandated for both Jews and K''rovei Yisrael , and
    is highly recommended for believing Gentiles as well. The particulars of how
    to accomplish it need prayer - especially in these modern times when text
    that includes God''s Name can be deleted from a computer or from cyberspace at
    the touch of a button. 1. In Orthodox Jewish practice the list is

  commentary_rudolph: 'For Yeshua to say that to follow him we must leave our homes and members of
    our family seems unreasonably extreme until we understand what he means. It
    is disclosed in Luke 18:22 in which Yeshua tells the young leader: There is one thing you still lack. Sell whatever you have, distribute the
    proceeds to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come, follow
    me! Verse 23 that follows tells the story: But when the man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very
    rich. For him giving up wealth was a requirement because he was enamored of his
    holdings to the extent that he gave it precedence over following Yeshua. For
    many of us, money may not be the hindrance; what each of us must give up or
    walk away from will be according to our own idolatries and excessive
    affections. What Yeshua is calling us to do, is to divest ourselves of everything and
    everyone that we care about more than we care about him. Were Yeshua a mere
    mortal, his insistence on this would be akin to human slavery and sinful. But
    Yeshua is not a mere mortal; " in him, bodily, lives the fullness of all
    that God is " ( Colossians 2:9 ), and he is God''s son. Although pursuing eternal life (salvation) is not commanded, it is the clear
    benefit and result of following Yeshua.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures quoted above clearly show that the Land of Israel was given to
    the Children of Israel (the Jewish people) as a main component of God''s
    covenant with Abraham. Those that say otherwise (principally Islamic Arabs
    and their supporters) are contradicting both the Holy Scriptures and the
    writings of their revered "prophet" Mohammed. Because God gave the Land of Israel to the Jews, it is sinful to deny it to
    them and a mitzvah to support them in the Land. There are many ways
    to give that support. Some Jews are called to make Aliyah (emigrate)
    to Israel and become part of Israeli Jewish society, while others remain
    among the nations (the diaspora) and contribute by donating and raising money
    for Israel, by visiting Israel to work on kibbutzim , by participating
    in humanitarian causes that benefit Israel and its citizens, and by praying
    in accordance with Psalm 122:6-9 : Pray for shalom in Yerushalayim; may those who love you prosper. May shalom be within your ramparts, prosperity in your palaces. For the sake of my family and friends, I say, "Shalom be within you!" For the sake of the house of ADONAI our God, I will seek your
    well-being. There is a caveat associated with this Mitzvah , and that is that we
    must distinguish between supporting Israel''s right to exist and thrive on the
    one hand, and supporting the politics of its secular government on the other.
    Because God''s hand is on Israel it is often right in its political decisions,
    but not always because it is not yet fully submitted to God and Messiah. In
    faith, that will come soon, but meanwhile we must seek divine discernment for
    how to pray and how to support.'

    believing in God is connected to trusting God, since one cannot trust in

  commentary_rudolph: 'There is no explicit biblical commandment to determine the occurrence of the

    of months and to the New Year makes it a logical imperative to do so. Colossians 2:16 is the only mention of the New Moon in the Apostolic
    Writings, but there are several references in the New Testament to months and
    years. The difficulty of determining the appearance of a New Moon is that there is
    no appearance of the moon at all. On the night of a New Moon, one sees no
    moon - similar to nights that are clouded over. During the time of Yeshua,
    the New Moon was declared by the San Hedrin upon its receiving the
    testimony of two individuals that they observed it. How can one see a moon
    that one cannot see? The testimony received was that the witnesses saw the
    last sliver of moon showing from the night previous. Using modern astronomical methods of determining the New Moon is more precise
    and is acceptable in most of Judaism today. Explaining these methods is,
    however, beyond the scope of this Mitzvah .'

  commentary_rudolph: "Scripture tells us that God is our Heavenly Father, that we are His created\nchildren, and that He wants us to have a loving relationship with Him. At the\nsame time, we are not to approach Him with the same kind of comfortable\nfamiliarity as we would a peer, but with awesome respect, having full\nknowledge of His power. This is easier to understand for those of us who have (or had) godly and\nloving parents here on earth, because we have experienced, in the natural,\nwhat good fathers and mothers are like, and we are able to transfer our\nunderstanding to our relationship with God. It is more difficult (and even\ncounter-intuitive) for those of us who have not had good parental\nexperiences, so we must glean our understanding from the words of Scripture,\nand from what others tell us and teach us. The attributes of God disclosed in Scripture are many, and often seem\ncontradictory. God is compassionate, yet He executes judgment. God loves,\nyet He punishes. So when we read in Deuteronomy 6:5 \" ... you are\nto love ADONAI your God with all your heart ... \", and then read in\nScriptures like Deuteronomy 6:13 \" ... You are to fear ADONAI your\nGod ... \", we may not know what to think. The problem is partially that our English language Bibles tend to use the\nword \"fear\" to translate different underlying Hebrew and Greek words used in\ndifferent kinds of situations. So, for example, the derivative of ( yarei ) that is\napplied to God in Deuteronomy 6:13 means \"reverend fear\" - the kind\nthat holds God in awe, deference, and honor. Yes, the word can also mean to\nbe afraid of God but, when it is used that way, it is meant as a warning to\nsinners who ought to be afraid. It is a different kind of fear that is referred to in 2 Timothy 1:7 ,\nwhich the NKJ version translates: For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and\nof a sound mind. Here, the Greek word for \"fear\" Î´ÎµÎ¹Î»á½·Î± ( deiliah ), which has a different connotation than ( yarei ) in that it\nmeans a lack of courage, cowardice, or timidity. Other Greek words such as Ï\x86á½¹Î²oÏ\x82 ( phabas ) and Ï\x86oÎ²á½³Ï\x89 ( phabei-oh ) in 2 Corinthians 5:11 and 1 Peter 2:17 respectively, have connotations similar to ( yarei ). In addition to the lexical evidence that fearing God (for an obedient\nbeliever) should not mean being afraid of Him, we also have textual evidence\nfor the same premise. A Scripture that strongly implies this is Proverbs\n22:4 ; it informs us that \"fear of God\" (\"fear\" being derived from ) is a reward that results\nfrom our being humble. In other words, it is a good thing - not something\nto be dreaded. Another Scripture that implies something similar is Ephesians 5:21 that tells us to \" submit to one another in fear of\nthe Messiah \" (\"fear\" here is Ï\x86á½¹Î²oÏ\x82). There\nis no other place in the New\nCovenant Scriptures that suggests that we should be afraid of Messiah Yeshua\nand, in fact, everything we\
    \ read about Him suggests the opposite. Therefore\n\"fear of the Messiah\" (and therefore Ï\x86á½¹Î²oÏ\x82 in this context) could not mean being\nafraid and must, instead, be referring to a character virtue."

  commentary_rudolph: 'Mercy and compassion are often referred to in the same Scripture, and the
    various translations of the Bible sometimes do not agree on which of the
    words should be used in a given verse. Although they are related to loving
    our neighbor, mercy and compassion are not the same. Compassion is an
    empathetic identification with a person''s trial or difficulty, whereas mercy
    is an action (or intentional inaction) of withholding harm from a person that
    one is empowered to impart. It is ideal when mercy is driven by compassion,
    but it is sometimes driven by other motivators as well, such as duty and
    considerations of practicality. Sympathy is also referred to in Scripture,
    but it is different in that it is more of a cognitive recognition of a
    person''s difficulty, that is not necessarily accompanied by an emotional
    response. Mercy and compassion are attributes of God, that God wants to be our
    attributes as well. The reason that God can require them of us is that they
    are part of creation - part of His having created us in His image. Whereas,
    compassion comes upon us automatically, whether or not we extend mercy
    requires that we decide based upon circumstances, and there are times (e.g.
    when justice requires punishment) when it is right to withhold mercy even
    while feeling compassion. The Scriptures presented herein are clear that it is God''s will that we have
    an attitude of mercy toward our neighbor, the reason being that God is
    merciful toward us. Indeed, mercy is an attribute of God, for we read in Exodus 34:6-7: ADONAI passed before him and proclaimed: "YUD-HEH-VAV-HEH!!!
    Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [[ADONAI]] is God, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger,
    rich in grace and truth; showing grace to the thousandth generation,
    forgiving offenses, crimes and sins; yet not exonerating the guilty, but
    causing the negative effects of the parents'' offenses to be experienced by
    their children and grandchildren, and even by the third and fourth
    generations. This is known within Judaism as the "Thirteen Attributes of Mercy" or

  commentary_rudolph: 'The common understanding of scholars is that Yeshua''s exhortation to
    Nicodemus in John 3:7 that he "must be born again from above" was a
    reference to his first birth being from the waters of natural childbirth.
    There is, however, another way to understand this, and that is that man''s
    first birth was also from above - from the waters of creation ( Genesis
    1:1-2 ) - and that man''s original death due to Adam''s disobedience
    required that he be "born again from above" in order for him to have eternal
    life, which was God''s original intention. One might argue that being "born again" (while it is God''s desire for us all)
    is not a true mitzvah because the power to accomplish it is God''s and
    not ours. True, the supernatural power to cause a man to be born from above
    is God''s alone, but God gave us the key to unleash His power by receiving His
    son Yeshua - our Messiah - as we read in John 3:14-16 : Just as Moshe lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man
    be lifted up; so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life. For
    God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that
    everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life, instead of being utterly
    destroyed. Trusting [NKJ: Believing in] Yeshua as our Messiah (savior) means repenting
    of our former unbelief and accepting his sacrificial death as ours, and our
    means of receiving God''s forgiveness. Now every cohen stands every day doing his service, offering over and over
    the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this one, after he
    had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right
    hand of God, from then on to wait until his enemies be made a footstool for
    his feet. For by a single offering he has brought to the goal for all time
    those who are being set apart for God and made holy. ( Hebrews
    10:11-14 ) As a Messianic Jewish believer in Yeshua I am sometimes confronted with the
    following question or a variation of it: "I consider myself a good person. All the things the Bible teaches I try to
    do, and all the virtues the Bible teaches I try to have. Are you telling me
    that just because I do not believe that Yeshua is the Messiah I am destined
    for Hell?" My answer to the question is always the same: "Your standing with God and your salvation are not for me to judge, nor is it
    for me to tell God whom he can save and whom He cannot. I can only tell you
    that Acts 4:12 of the New Covenant Scriptures teaches that " There
    is salvation in no one else " [meaning no one other than Yeshua], and that

    you want to take your chances and negotiate with God for some other way to

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah commands against seeking, engaging in, or utilizing
    occult supernatural powers. The term "occult" covers a wide range of
    prohibited activities that include (but are not limited to) divining,
    fortune-telling, sorcery, astrology, magic, wizardry, witchcraft, enchanting,
    soothsaying, spell-casting, or consulting the dead or communicating with
    spirits other than the Spirit of God. This Mitzvah is relevant today
    because many (if not all) of the occult practices mentioned in Scriptures are
    still practiced in certain quarters. Some more recent occult activities that
    are not mentioned in Scripture are hexing, water witching, numerology, Kabbalah , voodoo, new age spiritism, mindreading, channeling, energy
    healing (and there are others). It is not necessary to know the definitions
    of each of these or how each is different from the others. All that one
    needs to know is that it is a serious sin to attempt to communicate with any
    spirit other than the Holy Spirit, or to seek power from any source other
    than from God.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is formulated by joining together two commandments
    (directed to the Israelites) that were priesthood-related - the second
    reversing the first. Subsequent to God having saved the firstborn sons of
    the Israelites when He slew the firstborn males (both sons and cattle) of the
    Egyptians ( Exodus 11:4-6 ), He declared also, that all firstborn of the
    womb belonged to Him ( Exodus 13:1-2 , 34:19 ; Numbers
    3:13 ). We understand that to mean that each Israelite family was to
    sanctify its firstborn son (i.e., dedicate him to service in the Tabernacle
    and later the Temple). After Moses rebuked the Israelites for worshiping the
    Golden Calf and only the Levites stepped forward to repent ( Exodus
    32:25-29 ), God took the priesthood away from the Israelites as a whole,
    and gave it to the Levites ( Numbers 1:49-53 , 3:12 ), appointing
    the sons of Aaron to serve as cohanimi in place of the firstborn sons
    of the Israelites ( Numbers 3:10 ). He did this, not by revoking His
    previous commandment to sanctify each Israelite firstborn son, but by
    commanding that each Israelite family redeem their firstborn son from
    priestly service by paying a Levitical cohen five shekalim of money
    ( Numbers 3:40-51 , 18:15-16 ). Because underlying this Mitzvah are commandments with which Levites
    can no longer comply, I could have easily omitted it as being obsolete. I
    chose not to do so, however, because (1) the ceremony of Pidyon HaBen (redemption of the firstborn son) is performed among many Jewish people
    today, and (2) Yeshua''s consecration (and possibly His simultaneous Pidyon
    HaBen ) is recorded in Luke 2:22-32 . There is no biblically specified ceremony for sanctifying the firstborn son
    today, although circumcision may be thought of as a sanctification ceremony
    for all male Jewish children, with the firstborn of them assumed to be
    specially sanctified. Today, when the firstborn son of a Jewish family (not
    a cohen or a Levite) is 30 days old, he is taken to a Levitical cohen who receives the monetary equivalent of five shekalim from the father, and then proceeds to bless the child with the Birkat
    Cohanim (the Aaronic Benediction). Since Temple shekalim are no
    longer in use, their equivalent value in silver is substituted - either
    special coins made for the purpose or, in the U.S., five pre-1936 silver
    dollars (26.73 grams of 90% silver). It is obvious that this Mitzvah is based upon the assumption of a
    functioning Temple priesthood that does not exist today. Nevertheless, I
    believe it is important for Messianic Jews to comply ceremonially in the
    universal Jewish way for three reasons: (1) without it, there is no closure
    regarding the priestly status of firstborn male Israelites beyond their
    general priestly identity as Jews; (2) without it, there is ambiguity
    regarding the continuing priestly status of today''s descendants of Aaron
    (i.e. Levitical cohanim ); and (3) there is value in our being in
    solidarity with the rest of the Jewish world on this. I do not, however,
    believe that failing to comply with this Mitzvah in this New Covenant
    age is sinful. The ceremony of Pidyon HaBen only has meaning when performed within
    non-Levitical Jewish families since historically, the Levites were not
    redeemed and did, therefore, serve in the Temple. Although the ceremony is
    traditionally the responsibility of a firstborn son''s Jewish father, in
    Messianic Judaism it may also be performed by his Jewish mother or by himself
    when he comes of age. The Pidyon HaBen ceremony has no historic or
    spiritual meaning at all for Gentiles.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'In ancient Israel, the life-sustaining commodities were foods grown in the
    soil, typically grains and grapes. God''s commandments to leave the gleanings
    and reserve a part of the fields and vineyards for the poor and the foreigner
    were part of His larger plan to provide for those who could not otherwise
    live (e.g. Ruth 2:2 ). It is instructive that no such commandments
    were given regarding herds, flocks, manufactured goods, and artisans''
    services other than the left-over of certain animal offerings to be given to
    the Levites. My conclusion, therefore, is that these commandments were not
    intended to impute broad moral responsibility to the owners of all industries
    and commodities; their purpose was solely tz''dakah . Although the Scriptures heretofore presented have diminished applicability in
    today''s industrial and technical world, they must be complied with literally
    in agricultural environments where they can be applied. There are also wider
    applications of the Scriptures that should be considered by those of us who
    produce or provide life-sustaining (or even life-enhancing) products and
    services of a non-agricultural nature, and are moved to comply with the
    spirit of what God sought to achieve in ancient Israel. In such cases, part
    of our production (be they goods or services) can be identified and set apart
    as tz''dakah (over and above our other requirements to give tz''dakah ), and the items themselves or profits therefrom can be given
    to the poor and
    disadvantaged. 1 Setting aside food and clothing in food banks and humanitarian aid centers is
    very much in keeping with this concept, and a goodly number of synagogues and
    churches participate in this kind of charitable giving. Another opportunity for applying this Mitzvah occurs when we
    inadvertently produce defective but usable products. When that happens,
    instead of discarding them or selling them at a discount for our own gain, we
    could donate the irregular items or the proceeds of their sale to the poor
    and disadvantaged. Examples of such items are blemished fruits, irregularly
    sewn garments, unevenly cut building materials, discolored fabrics, and
    dented appliances. The original agricultural commandments stand unchanged and are mandatory,
    whereas this broader mitzvah is optional but recommended for prayerful
    resolution. 1. In ancient Israel, foreigners were protected by
    God''s Commandments because they were disadvantaged, as were widows and
    orphans.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah to not eat the blood of birds or animals is so important
    that it applies, not only to Israel (the Jewish people) under the Mosaic
    Covenant, but to Gentiles as well. Scripture states that the life is in the
    blood, and it is true in more ways than just biologically. This prohibition
    of eating blood dates all the way back to Genesis and, although we do not
    have many details of the animal sacrifices that far back, we can assume that
    the blood of the animals was poured out in the process of conducting the
    sacrifice, just as was commanded during the time of Moses. So, the "life in
    the blood" spoken of in Scripture was not only that of the sacrificed animal,
    but was also a reference to the life of the person that brought the sacrifice
    - his mortal life as well as his eternal life. The prohibition of our eating animal blood in the New Covenant is most
    interesting. Yeshua is our ultimate sacrifice and, according to Matthew
    26:28 , His blood was shed on behalf of many, so that they may have their sins forgiven. Therefore, now that Yeshua has given his life''s blood, it would be wrong for
    believers in Yeshua to continue to seek forgiveness for our sins and life
    with God through the blood of animals. That is why Yeshua directed his
    disciples in Mark 14:23-24 to drink His blood instead. 1 But "why," one may ask, "was the prohibition against eating animal blood
    begun as early as Genesis?" I believe that it was prophetic. In essence, it
    was saying that all blood must be respected and not treated as mere food
    because life is in blood, and one day the Messiah will come and His blood
    will be poured out for us (figuratively) to eat. In an attempt to extract blood from meat before it is cooked, Orthodox
    Judaism prescribes a procedure called " kashering " (also called
    " koshering ") that consists of first soaking the meat in cold water,
    and then salting the meat with medium-coarse crystals of salt. The procedure
    is not considered necessary if the meat is roasted on an open flame. Clearly, no procedure can remove all blood from meat, so what is God''s
    expectation of us in complying with this Mitzvah ? My opinion is that
    God wants us to be conscious of blood when we decide what meat to eat, and
    that he expects us to refrain from eating or drinking whole blood and foods
    that are intentionally made with blood, or where blood is added (e.g. blood
    sausage). It is my personal belief that He also expects us to refrain from
    eating meat from an animal whose blood was not intentionally drained from it
    at the time of (or soon after) slaughtering it, or killing it in a hunt.
    Kashering is a noble effort to remove blood from meat, but I do not consider
    it necessary unless it is to comply with the standards of Jewish Orthodoxy.
    If that is the reason, there are other considerations as well, such as there
    being rabbinical supervision of the slaughtering and processing of the
    resulting meat product. 1. We do not drink Yeshua''s blood literally, but figuratively through
    the Shulchan Adonai , as a way of participating in His blood
    sacrifice.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is related to the Mitzvah on "Obeying Torah ". The emphasis here is somewhat different however, in that this Mitzvah has to do with listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit and
    allowing Him to guide us on how God''s Commandments should be applied in our
    particular circumstances. What it means to obey God''s commandments (those written down by Moses) is
    clear, but what is not so clear is what listening to God''s voice means.
    Rabbinical Judaism would say that it is referring to an "Oral Torah "
    - words allegedly spoken to Moses that were not written down, but rather
    conveyed verbally (as an oral tradition) from generation-to-generation. I do
    not believe that, nor do I believe that listening to God''s voice is a mere
    metaphor for understanding what the written words of Torah say, nor
    does it mean hearing the words of Torah read aloud. Scripture is clear
    that, in the New Covenant, we are able to hear God speak to us (usually in a
    still small voice within us) by means of the Holy Spirit. At the time of
    Elijah, the New Covenant had not yet come in His fullness, yet Elijah was
    able to hear that still small voice of God because he was gifted with the
    Holy Spirit; consider 1 Kings 19:11-12 : He [the angel] said, ''Go outside, and stand on the mountain before
    ADONAI''; and right then and there, ADONAI went past. A mighty blast of wind
    tore the mountains apart and broke the rocks in pieces before ADONAI, but
    ADONAI was not in the wind. After the wind came an earthquake, but ADONAI was
    not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, fire broke out; but ADONAI was
    not in the fire. And after the fire came a quiet, subdued voice. The Israelites of old heard and were guided by God''s voice in primarily three
    ways - audibly from Mount Sinai (rarely) (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:32-33 ),
    from angels (e.g. Exodus 23:20-22 ) or from prophets (e.g. Numbers
    12:6 ; Deuteronomy 18:17-18 ) who were specially gifted to hear the
    voice of the Holy Spirit, and repeat it to the inquirer. God''s Voice can be
    heard today at least as clearly as it was in the past, because today we have
    the great gift of the New Covenant that was prophesied in Jeremiah
    31:30-33(31-34) , whereby the Torah is written on our hearts by the
    Holy Spirit who dwells within each and every one of us who will receive Him.
    Today, each of us we can hear God''s voice in the same way as (in fact, more
    clearly than) the prophets of old heard Him; as Jeremiah prophesied,
    we no longer have to inquire of our neighbor or brother, for we all can know
    and hear Him ourselves. It is clear to me that God''s voice is and always has
    been the voice of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, God speaks through His written
    commandments, but it is the Holy Spirit that gives the commandments voice for
    application in our individual lives and
    circumstances. 1 Expecting to hear God''s Voice with a mind to obey it is very important if we
    are to have an intimate and loving relationship with God ( John 14:15,
    21 ) - so much so that Romans 8:14 says of it: All who are led by God''s Spirit are God''s sons. Because men''s hearing of God''s voice can be faulty, we are admonished to by 1 Thessalonians 5:21 test everything [and] hold onto what is good It is the approach used by the men of Berea who " welcomed Paul''s
    message ", but engaged in checking the Tanakh every day to see if the things Sha''ul was saying were
    true ( Acts
    17:11 ). 2 1. English translations of Deuteronomy 28:1-2
    and 18 generally use the word "obey" when referring to (God''s
    commandments), and "listen to" when referring to (the sound of
    God''s voice). That notwithstanding, the Hebrew word used for both
    "obey" and "listen to" in these Scriptures is the same - a derivation of
    the word ( sh''ma ), and so the two functions of listening and obeying
    cannot be separated. On the other hand, derivations of Hebrew words (commandments)
    and (sound of voice)
    are both used in the Deuteronomy Scriptures and, since these are not
    the same, God''s written Word and God''s voice must be thought of
    and dealt with differently. 2. See also 1 Corinthians 14:29'

    Scriptures single out three festivals ( Shavuot , Sukkot , and Sh''mini Atzeret - the eighth day assembly) for rejoicing - possibly
    because they are festivals of harvest. Most of the appointed times listed in Leviticus 23 , while required to
    be kept by Jews, are only optional for Gentiles who are not K''rovei
    Yisrael . Sukkot is an exception however, because of Zechariah
    14:16 ''s reference to "all the nations". That notwithstanding, its
    description is of the "Age to Come", so its requirement for Gentile
    participation in this age cannot be established. However, Gentiles

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah consolidates a number of God''s mitzvot into the
    single principle that we are to deal fairly and honestly when transacting
    business with our neighbors; it applies equally to the buyer and to the
    seller of both goods and services. The buyer must not defraud a seller by
    purchasing an item which he knows (or suspects) is under-priced in error.
    Likewise, a seller must not sell an item whose condition and value do not
    justify its price. Error in price is only one of several kinds of errors which can be made. It
    is possible that either the buyer or the seller could err in the identity,
    condition, or usability of an item. If an error is made and discovered within
    a reasonable time by either party, it should be called to the other party''s
    attention, and an adjustment should be negotiated to meet Scripture''s
    requirement of fairness. In an ethical sale, nothing is concealed, there is full disclosure, and both
    parties act willingly and without coercion. This is in partial contrast with
    the British and American Common-law which does not countenance fraud, but
    embraces the principle of Caveat Emptor - "Let the buyer beware!" Intentionally using inaccurate weights and measures in a transaction of
    buying or selling is, of course, dishonest and sinful. However, it can also
    be accidental, so Scripture prohibits even possessing weights and measures
    that are inaccurate. To make the point graphic, Maimonides states that one
    cannot possess an inaccurate measuring vessel, even if it is only used to
    collect urine.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah re-formulates two of the traditional taryag
    mitzvot into a mitzvah having three components. The traditional mitzvot direct us to (1) sanctify God''s Name, and (2) not profane
    God''s Name. The components of this re-formulated mitzvah direct us to
    (1) treat God as holy, (2) proclaim God''s holiness, and (3) not profane God''s
    Name. There is logic to linking them in this way. God proclaims His own
    holiness, and requires that we acknowledge it by being obedient to these
    three directives. God''s holiness encompasses His entire nature that includes
    His integrity, purity, trustworthiness, goodness, righteousness, justice,
    compassion, love, and all His other attributes. There are other ways (in addition to these three) of acknowledging God''s
    holiness, but the key to them all is holding God holy in our hearts and
    thoughts and reminding ourselves of it regularly. That is the purpose of the
    third benediction of the Amidah and of the Kedushah - prayers
    that are a part of most synagogue services. The third benediction of the Amidah states: 1 You are holy and Your Name is holy, and holy ones praise You every day,
    forever. Blessed are You, Hashem, the Holy God. And the Kedushah (quoting Isaiah 6:3 ) states: 2 We shall sanctify Your Name in this world, just as they sanctify It in heaven
    above, as it is written by Your prophet, "And one [angel] will call to
    another and say: ''Holy, holy, holy is Hashem, Master of Legions, the whole
    world is filled with His glory.'' And it ends with 3 From generation to generation we shall relate Your greatness and for infinite

  commentary_rudolph: 'The designation of Israel to be a "kingdom of priests" and a "nation set
    apart" originated with the covenant that God made with Abraham. It was
    renewed through Isaac and again through Jacob, and came into fullness with
    the covenant that God made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai. We call the
    covenant with Abraham "the Abrahamic Covenant," and the one at Mount Sinai,
    "the Mosaic Covenant". Although the Mosaic Covenant was given to Israel, its ultimate purpose was
    not only to benefit Israel, but rather that, through Israel functioning as a
    kingdom of priests, the rest of the world (i.e. the Gentile nations) would be
    blessed. God''s plan was (and still is) to bring His Word to the Jew first,
    and the Jew to bring it to the Gentile. It doesn''t always work out that way,
    but that is the overall plan. Edom, Assyria, and ancient Egypt have a special role in that plan as being
    examples of the nations of the world that do not know God. The Israelites of
    old had reason to despise these three in particular. Esau (the patriarch of
    the Edomites) showed disdain for his birthright by selling it to his brother
    Jacob, and he later hated his brother for it ( Genesis 27:41 ). At one
    point in history, Assyria (Iran today) subjugated Edom (which became an
    Assyrian vassal state), and captured and subjugated the Israelites of ancient
    Samaria. Both Edom and Assyria were, therefore, enemies of Israel at one
    time, and Egypt became an enemy of ancient Israel as well. Although Egypt
    first sheltered and provided sustenance for the Israelites, it later
    oppressed and enslaved them. What is remarkable considering what has transpired, is that the Mosaic
    Scriptures name all three as blessed nations, and though they (the three
    nations) and their descendants may hate us and hate God''s ways even today, we
    are, nevertheless, to bring the "Good News" of Yeshua to them with love and
    with the hope and expectation that some will receive it. In that way and
    through our prayers and our example of being a servant people devoted to
    loving God and neighbor, the Jewish people are uniquely commissioned by God
    to be a light to their own ("the lost sheep of the house of Israel") first,
    and then to the Gentile nations of the world.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Merriam-Webster defines sexual "lust" as "an unusually intense or unbridled
    sexual desire." Since the Bible unambiguously says that "lust" is sin,
    Merriam-Webster''s first alternative ("an unusually intense sexual
    desire") cannot be the one meant because mere feelings, no matter how strong,
    are never sin. The second definition ("an unbridled sexual desire") is
    closer to what is meant, the inclusion of "unbridled" making the difference.
    Restated, the sexual sin of lust comprises the prurient desire for a person
    that is not our spouse, coupled with one or more wrongful actions designed to
    gratify the desire; ergo, the title of this Mitzvah: "Giving Ourselves to
    Unlawful Sexual Desires." The reason that Yeshua (in Matthew 5:28 )
    was able to say that "a man who even looks at a woman with the purpose of
    lusting after her has already committed adultery in his heart," is that the
    man he is speaking of is not only feeling sexual desire for the woman, but
    has already begun to pursue her either in his mind or by his actions. With
    this understanding, David''s adultery with Bat-Sheva did not begin when
    they had sexual intercourse; it began when David sent his messengers to fetch
    her ( 2 Samuel 11:1-4 ).'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah prohibits us from deriving any benefit from idolatry.
    This includes deriving benefit from objects of idolatry, from idolatry as a
    practice, and from those who engage in it. We are prohibited from selling or
    even possessing objects of idolatrous worship, and thereby benefitting from
    their value and the intrinsic value of their material components. We are also
    prohibited from benefitting in less obvious ways such as (I would argue)
    employing idolaters to do for us on the Shabbat , that which we are
    commanded to not do ourselves. It also prohibits us from benefitting from
    idols that are not of the physical kind, but rather idols of the heart and
    flesh such as pride, lust, self before God (and others), etc. There are
    numerous ways that we might be able to (but must not) derive benefit from
    such idols; an example would be compromising a moral biblical precept in
    order to not lose a business opportunity (see Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 ). Idols of all kinds (including things of the occult) are associated with
    demons and curses (see Deuteronomy 7:26 ), and we must therefore not
    possess them, take them into our homes, or even touch them. It is a matter of
    discernment, however, as to how direct the receiving of benefit from an idol
    or idolatry must be, in order for it to be considered a violation of
    Scripture. For example, is it permissible to eat food prepared by one you
    suspect of being an idol worshiper? Suppose the restaurant one enters
    exhibits a statue of Buddha or displays food sacrificed to the proprietor''s
    ancestors? Interestingly, Scripture allows Israelites to receive commercial
    benefit from foreigners (most likely idolaters during the time of Moses) that
    they cannot receive from fellow Jews. One such example is that all debts are
    cancelled during the sh''mittah (sabbatical year) as to fellow Jews but
    not as to foreigners ( Deuteronomy 15:1-3 ). Therefore, if you loan to
    a foreigner and the sh''mittah arrives, you can continue to collect
    what you have loaned, whereas, if you loan to a Jew you cannot. Another
    example is that, according to Deuteronomy 23:21(20) , a Jew can lend at
    interest to an outsider (presumably even an idolater), whereas a loan to a
    fellow Jew has to be interest-free. Finally, note the similarity of Acts 15:28-29 and Deuteronomy
    32:38 in their instruction to not eat or drink foods connected to idol
    worship. They both prohibit the physical eating of such foods, but one might
    perceive a broader and higher meaning from them, which is to abstain from
    nourishing ourselves with anything related to idolatry.'

  commentary_rudolph: '"Following" God, "imitating" Him, and "walking" in His ways are different
    ways of saying the same thing - learning God''s ways and adopting them as our
    own. We see from the above Scriptures that this principle traverses both the
    Mosaic Covenant and the New Covenant, and that adopting the ways of Yeshua
    (who is more visible to us than the Father) assures us of adopting the ways
    of our Father in heaven as well. Yeshua Himself modeled this for us as we
    read His words in John 5:19 : Therefore, Yeshua said this to them: "Yes, indeed! I tell you that the Son
    cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing;
    whatever the Father does, the Son does too." There is a common misunderstanding that the Scriptures quoted in this Mitzvah should help dispel; the misunderstanding is that only through
    the indwelling of the Ru''ach HaKodesh brought by the New Covenant, can
    men succeed in obeying God. It is wrong because God never holds us
    accountable for that which we cannot do, and Scripture teaches that, at Mt.
    Sinai, God gave us instructions for conduct that He expected of us. On the
    other hand, to think that man on his own can accomplish God''s will is wrong
    also, so what of the Spirit was available to man before the coming of the New
    Covenant? Since man in his own strength cannot fully accomplish God''s will,
    it must be that the Holy Spirit was available at Sinai and before, but that
    the level of the Spirit''s availability was limited and was greatly increased
    with the coming of the New Covenant. Jeremiah 31:32-33(33-34) partially explains this: "For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra''el after
    those days," says ADONAI: I will put my Torah within them and write it on
    their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer
    will any of them teach his fellow community member or his brother, ''Know
    ADONAI''; for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
    because I will forgive their wickednesses and remember their sins no
    more." Jeremiah prophesies both the Messiah and the Ru''ach HaKodesh - the
    Messiah to provide a just means for God to forgive our sins, and the Ru''ach to implant God''s very own nature within us in order to bring
    Him closer and assist us to walk in His ways. Ezekiel 36:24-27 also
    prophesies a New Covenant in which God would enhance our obedience through
    the Holy Spirit placed within us, yet God assured us in Deuteronomy
    30:11-14 , that we were able to obey Him in pre-Yeshua times as well: For this mitzvah which I am giving you today is not too hard for you, it
    is not beyond your reach. It isn''t in the sky, so that you need to ask,
    ''Who will go up into the sky for us, bring it to us and make us hear it,
    so that we can obey it?'' Likewise, it isn''t beyond the sea, so
    that you need to ask, ''Who will cross the sea for us, bring it to us and
    make us hear it, so that we can obey it?'' On the contrary, the word is
    very close to you - in your mouth, even in your heart; therefore, you can do
    it!'

  commentary_rudolph: '"Love of money" is a short way of saying "love of what money can buy". One
    naturally thinks of money buying goods and services and these alone are
    enough to ensnare those who are susceptible. However, there is a far greater
    evil in natural man''s quest for money; it is that money can buy the power of
    men''s obedience, and preoccupation with power is the opposite of trusting God
    and submitting to His power. Wanting to be powerful as God was what brought
    down Lucifer, and the idolatry of it can bring us down as well. The draw of
    money and what it can buy is so strong, so seductive, that we are commanded
    to flee from it. Pursuing godly virtues is the opposite of (and the antidote
    for) pursuing love of money, and is the reason that these two are linked in 1 Timothy 6:10-11 .'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This "positive" Mitzvah on "directing our speech, thoughts and actions
    to that which is good and holy" is a companion to a "negative" Mitzvah that "we are not to wrong one another through our speech." While the
    compilations of rabbinical commentators list many of the positive and
    negative elements of this Mitzvah , the weight of Scripture (that we
    should use every aspect of our being for good) suggests that this Mitzvah be written to combine them. This Mitzvah quotes a goodly number of Scriptures that reference how
    we are to use (and not use) speech and actions, but I want to also address
    what might seem (at first) to be opposite, which is holding back on speech,
    or remaining silent. Proverbs 18:21 says that speech has power, but
    silence also has power, as we read in Isaiah 53:7 , a prophecy of
    Yeshua''s use of silence in the final hours of his life: He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened not His mouth; He
    was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is
    silent, So He opened not His mouth. Here are some other Scriptures that suggest times when there is wisdom and
    virtue in being slow to speak or in remaining silent: Exodus 14:14 (NIV): The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still. Psalm 37:7a : Be still before ADONAI; wait patiently till he comes. Proverbs 11:12 : He who belittles another lacks good sense, whereas a person of
    discernment stays silent. Proverbs 13:13 : He who guards his mouth preserves his life, but one who talks too much
    comes to ruin. Proverbs 17:28 : Even a fool, if he stays silent, is thought wise; he who keeps his mouth
    shut can pass for smart. James 1:19 : Therefore, my dear brothers, let every person be quick to listen but slow
    to speak, slow to get angry'

  commentary_rudolph: '" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you " is the well-known
    "golden rule", but it does not appear in the Bible in that form. What is in
    the Bible is Mark 12:30-31 , which states: ''... and you are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart, with all your
    soul, with all your understanding and with all your strength.'' The second is
    this: ''You are to love your neighbor as yourself.'' There is no other mitzvah
    greater than these. Applying that principle, Scripture teaches that we have a duty to help
    others, even to try to save the life of a person who is attacked. What is
    unclear is whether the duty applies even if it puts the protector in danger
    and, because Scripture is silent on the matter, I will not speculate. The parable of the "good Samaritan" is the classic Scripture that lauds
    assisting a person who has been attacked, but it is noteworthy that at no
    time was the "good Samaritan" in danger since he gave his help after the
    attack on the injured man had occurred. Nevertheless, he helped the stranger
    in need by spending his own time and money. Interestingly, some U.S. States have adopted what they call the "Good
    Samaritan Law" which does not require that a bystander help a person who is
    in distress, but states that if he does and causes injury in the process, he
    cannot be sued for his attempt.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah touches a number of principles, as can be seen from the
    large number of Scriptures and mitzvot of Meir, Maimonides, and
    Chinuch that are involved. It affirmatively requires that we lend money to
    our brother if he is in need, and to not charge him interest on the loan.
    Although historically commanded only to Israelites concerning their lending
    money to other Israelites, strangers, and sojourners who are in need, this Mitzvah to lend without interest applies in the New Covenant to all
    who are our brothers in Yeshua regardless of whether they are Jews or
    Gentiles. While we have no obligation under this Mitzvah to lend
    money to persons other than brothers, if we do lend money to other poor or
    needy persons, this Mitzvah strongly suggests that, out of compassion
    for their poverty, we not charge them interest either. Also, this Mitzvah ''s reference to the Sabbatical Year warns us that we must not
    decline to lend money to needy brothers prior to the Sabbatical Year, even
    though the debt will be legally discharged and may never be repaid. It
    should also be noted that Deuteronomy 15:7 (referenced above) implies
    an obligation to give charity ( tz''dakah ) as well as to loan, and Exodus 22:24(25) not only prohibits being a usurer of the needy, but
    also participating in it as a borrower (even as a needy borrower), a surety,
    a witness, or in any other way. Luke 6:34-36 tells us that if we loan money to someone (presumably
    someone in need), we ought not to expect anything in return; rather, our loan
    should be motivated by compassion and not by the hope of profiting from the
    transaction either directly or indirectly. In my opinion, several English
    translations of the Scripture (including the CJB) render verse 34 incorrectly by suggesting that the lender should not expect the loan itself
    to be repaid. Not only is such a notion inconsistent with other Scriptures,
    it contradicts the very nature and definition of a loan as distinguished from
    a gift. Deuteronomy 23:21(20) does not apply to loans made to needy persons;
    we know this because it allows an Israelite to charge interest to a stranger,
    whereas Leviticus 25:35 prohibits it if the stranger is poor.
    Nevertheless, it is included here because it indicates that an Israelite
    brother may not charge interest to another Israelite, even in the case of a
    general loan, e.g. a business loan. This is in direct conflict with the
    modern-day practice of charging interest for commercial loans, mortgages, and
    credit cards. It is possible that, in this anonymous, mixed, and
    credit-dependant society, this prohibition is no longer applicable because it
    would prohibit Jews from becoming bankers of any kind, and would prevent Jews
    from borrowing for business and from acquiring mortgages from banks whose
    officers were Jewish.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Sabbatical Year is known as the "Year of Release" ( Sh''mittah )
    because loans made to Israelites, by Israelites, are cancelled every seventh
    year. Also, Israelites are prohibited from denying loans to needy brothers
    when the Sabbatical Year approaches, despite the possibility that the loan
    will be discharged and not repaid voluntarily. The release of such loans
    does not (according to Deuteronomy 15:3 ) apply to - foreigners. I
    believe that one of the reasons God gave Israel the Sabbatical Year was to
    test well-to-do Israelites'' faith and reliance on Him. A question that naturally comes to mind is how releasing loans in the
    Sabbatical Year applies today in the New Covenant. I am of the opinion that
    it continues to apply where the circumstances are similar to those of ancient
    Israel, and that it applies not only to Jews but also to K''rov Yisrael Gentiles; how similar the circumstances need to be will be revealed by
    the Ruach HaKodesh as we pray for guidance. As for other non-Jewish
    followers of Yeshua, I am inclined to the position that as New Covenant
    brothers, literal compliance is a blessing for them but not a requirement; I
    partially draw this conclusion from Isaiah 56:1-7 , which promises
    blessing to the foreigner who keeps Gods Sabbaths, but does not require it of
    them (although admittedly most Sabbaths do not involve the release of debts).
    One thing that is certain, however, is that God continues to expect all of us
    to look to Him for provision rather than to think that we can cause provision
    to come to us by our own efforts. This Mitzvah has some interesting ramifications in modern times. One
    of these is that the enforced collection of debts today is generally
    accomplished through civil courts - not by batei din . Therefore, as a
    practical matter, there is no way to enforce the Mitzvah against
    suing a brother in a secular court if a creditor decides to violate it and
    sue on the debt. Also, because this Mitzvah is so closely connected
    to Jewish life in Eretz Yisrael , it is arguable as to whether it
    applies among brothers (brother Jews and brothers in Yeshua) in the Diaspora.
    The weight of rabbinical opinion is that it is valid for Jews everywhere, and
    it is my opinion that it also applies to Jewish and K''rov Yisrael members of Messianic Jewish communities in the Diaspora if the loans are
    given with the understanding that observing the Sh''mittah is part of
    the community''s halachah . It should not be surprising that this Mitzvah is unpopular among
    creditors and that it has encountered much resistance. During the latter
    years of the Second Temple, the sage Hillel became concerned by the growing
    number of Jews whose weak faith was such that they were declining to loan
    money to poor Jewish brothers when the Sabbatical Year was near. To urge
    them to do so, he invented a legal procedure that, in effect, circumvented
    God''s intent in giving the Mitzvah . The procedure, still used today,
    is known as a Pruzbul , and works this way: Some time before Sh''mittah , a lender gives ownership of his uncollected debt to a bet din which, in turn, appoints the lender to collect the debt for
    the bet din . The debt is not discharged by Sh''mittah because
    the bet din is a corporate entity, not a Jewish brother, so Deuteronomy 15:2 does not apply. When the lender collects the debt
    and attempts to give the proceeds to the bet din , he is told that the bet din does not want the money and he is instructed to keep it. I do not agree with using such casuistic ploys to collect debts or, for that
    matter, to avoid complying with God''s commandments in any other circumstance;
    I believe it is this kind of thinking that Yeshua was referring to when He
    said to the Pharisees: Thus, with your tradition which you had handed down to you, you nullify
    the Word of God! And you do other things like this. ( Mark 7:13 ) Nevertheless, I do not believe there is anything wrong with a lender
    accepting return of his money after Sh''mittah if it is offered
    voluntarily. The application of this commandment in modern credit societies requires some
    adjustment that is legitimate. First of all, commercial loans which are used
    to increase a person''s wealth, purchase mortgages, make investments, etc.,
    are not the intended application of this Mitzvah , although some of
    these loans are discharged as well. This Mitzvah is meant to apply to
    loans given by individuals, to individuals, because the borrower (who is a
    Jewish brother to the lender) is in some kind of personal need. Need-based
    loans must be given with generosity, and with willingness that the loan will
    be cancelled on the Sabbatical Year. Modern societies often have something
    like this in built into their civil laws that is called bankruptcy, where a
    person who becomes financially insolvent can receive a judicial discharge of
    his debts; in the United States, this is possible every six years.
    Bankruptcy laws are the modern alternative to indentured servanthood and
    Debtor''s Prison, and they reflect something of the same spirit as this mitzvah and the Year of Jubilee.'

    the lost - those who do not know God, and are in need of Messiah. We are
    nevertheless warned of a danger to us, which is that if we are not on our
    guard, we can allow ourselves to be ensnared by the things of the world that
    appeal to our flesh, and backslide into sin. The things of which we must
    beware are numerous - money, power, possessions, and illicit sex are but

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah commands us to have faith in God and trust Him for all
    things. Faith and trust are at the very heart of our relationship with God,
    so it is no wonder that there are so many Scriptures in the Bible that speak
    to it. Many Scriptures address it directly, and it is also built into the
    Jewish life experience through the Sh''mitah , the Year of Jubilee, and
    the various Sabbaths that require that we rest ourselves and/or our land,
    cancel debts, and return our land to its original owners every fifty years.
    All of these require that we put ourselves in God''s hands and trust Him to
    provide for us and protect us. Scripturally, there is no difference between faith and trust as we may see
    from the following two translations of Hebrews 11:1 : CJB: Trusting is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about
    things we do not see. NKJ: Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
    things not seen. This connection of trust and faith to our not seeing is vitally important.
    When we exercise faith, it is not only that we do not see God; that is always
    the case. It is that we do not see or understand the circumstance or the
    issue for which we trust Him, and we must therefore make ourselves vulnerable
    to Him and rely solely on Him. The extent to which we do that betrays how
    discipled we are. If we are new in the Lord, we likely give ourselves over
    to Him periodically and on a case by case basis. The ideal, however, is that
    our walk with God is one of continuous reliance and continuous trust as it
    appears was the case with Enoch in Genesis 5:24 : Hanokh [Enoch] walked with God, and then he wasn''t there, because God took
    him.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The following is Merriam-Webster''s definition of "Justice": 1a. The Maintenance of administration of what is just especially by the
    impartial adjustment of conflicting claims or the assignment of merited
    rewards or punishments. 1b. The administration of law; especially the establishment or determination
    of rights according to the rules of law or equity. 2a. The quality of being just, impartial, or fair. (1) The principle or ideal of just dealing or right action (2) Conformity to righteousness and law. 3. Conformity to truth, fact, or reason - correctness It is a helpful definition but not dispositive because it self-defines by
    using the word "just". "Justice" is hard to define. I think of it as fairness
    that is somehow connected to authority. It has the connotation of a person
    receiving that which is due him or that which he deserves. In reviewing the Scriptures with the purpose of listing those having to do
    with justice, it becomes apparent that one would have to list just about the
    entire Bible. The Scriptures listed in support of this Mitzvah are
    therefore only a representative sample of those that can be listed, and the
    Bible;s emphasis on justice is evidence of how important justice is to God. Justice (or the lack of it) exists in all of society, and can broadly be put
    into one of two categories. First, there is justice that is connected to a
    court of law or other governmental authority, where what is considered "just"
    is defined by a rule or statute. The other category is justice that is
    informal, and has to do with how individuals or groups of individuals treat
    each other in their daily encounters. There is also a term known as "social justice", that can involve either or
    both of the aforementioned categories. Exactly what "social justice"
    comprises is controversial, but it refers to the equality (or lack thereof)
    of individuals within society, regarding their opportunities, privileges, and
    the distribution of wealth. It is too great a subject to be dealt with in
    this Mitzvah . As with all of the Mosaic era commandments, many of those having to do with
    justice are no longer directly applicable in today''s world in which we live.
    Examples are the commandment establishing sanctuary cities and commandments
    prescribing punishments for infractions of law - capital punishment in
    particular. Whereas, capital punishment was the ultimate penalty under the
    Mosaic Law and still is today under many systems of secular law, it no longer
    exists under the New Covenant, for which the ultimate penalty is expulsion
    from the body of believers (see Matthew 18:17 ). We understand that
    today''s legal matters pertaining to persons and things outside of the body of
    believers are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the secular governments to
    which we are subject, but we consider the Mosaic Law still relevant in
    guiding us as to the principles of punishment, restitution, restoration, and
    God''s will in general. In order for a court to have the capacity to adjudicate a case, it must have
    three kinds of jurisdiction - personal, territorial, and subject-matter. This
    applies to ecclesiastical courts as well as to secular courts, except that
    the territorial jurisdictions of ecclesiastical courts are considered to be
    the entire world. Secular courts get their subject-matter jurisdiction from
    civil laws (e.g. statutes, ordinances, case law, etc.), whereas
    ecclesiastical courts usually get their subject-matter jurisdiction from the
    Bible. 1 Personal jurisdiction is acquired in various ways in each of the court
    systems. In the secular courts it is sometimes connected to the defendant''s
    domicile, sometimes to where damages sued for have occurred, and sometimes it
    is defined by statute. Personal jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical court is a
    debated matter. It should be over all believers - Jews (Messianic &
    non-Messianic) if it is a rabbinical court ( beit din ) and over all
    Messianic Jews and Gentile believers in Yeshua if it is a court convened by a
    Christian church or Messianic synagogue. Sometimes, personal jurisdiction is
    acquired by the defendant being a member of a congregation, denomination,
    network of congregations, or organization; plaintiffs are automatically
    subject to the jurisdiction of the court to which they apply for relief. 1. Sometimes also from extra-biblical writings such as the
    Talmud.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Castration is removing or doing irreparable damage to a male''s testicles.
    There is no specific commandment in Scripture prohibiting the castration of
    human beings or animals, but we surmise it with regard to men from the
    Scriptures cited that impute holiness-connected disabilities to castrated
    men and beasts. Castrated men were prohibited from entering the assembly of
    the Lord and could not serve as priests, and castrated animals could not be
    used for sacrifice in the Temple. So far as I am aware, men-slaves are no longer castrated to produce eunuchs
    for guarding harams or young boys castrated to preserve their soprano,
    mezzo-soprano or contralto voices. Nevertheless, our society does neuter
    male animals to change their behavior, their size, or their tenderness when
    used for food. For example, steer meat comes from a castrated bull, a capon
    "chicken" is a castrated rooster, and an ox is a steer that has been bred for
    work. Castrating animals or fowls does not appear to prohibit their being
    considered kosher for food. Castration of men is occasionally done for medical reasons (e.g. cancer), and
    our various societies have, on occasion, castrated especially sex offenders

  commentary_rudolph: 'There are three kinds of inheritance referred to in Scripture; they are (1)
    financial inheritance (money, personal property and land), (2) royal
    inheritance (e.g. kingship passing from father to son), and (3) moral
    inheritance (i.e. non-tangible assets such as character traits and ethical
    values. In addition, there are two mechanisms that govern inheritance - (1)
    last wills and testaments, and (2) statutes of intestacy (i.e. rules that
    govern inheritance in the absence of a last will and testament). All of
    these date back to the time of Moses and before but, because today we live
    under secular governments (not the theocracy of ancient Israel), today''s laws
    of inheritance are what govern. Financial inheritance under Moses and today are the same in that they were
    and are controlled by statute, albeit statutes that are different. The system
    of financial inheritance under and prior to Moses was what we call
    "primogeniture". It is where all the financial assets of a deceased person
    are inherited by the person''s firstborn or eldest son (sometimes firstborn
    daughters inherited as well), who then become the family''s patriarch and is
    expected to use his inheritance to care for his siblings and their families.
    Primogeniture still exists in places, but has been largely eliminated in the
    western world where it has been replaced by laws of intestacy and "last wills
    and testaments." Wills that are duly made and executed govern (within
    limits) and, in the absence of a will, a person''s financial assets usually go
    to his spouse and children according to a statutorily defined plan. Royal inheritance, where it exists in kingdoms today, is similar to how it
    was at times in the past, in that it normally goes to the firstborn child
    (sometimes the firstborn son) by law. In that way it is similar to
    primogeniture in that the firstborn has responsibility to provide for his
    siblings as kings have responsibility to provide for their subjects. King
    David was succeeded by his son Solomon in what is sometimes referred to as
    the Davidic Dynasty, and the kingship passed from father to son) until the
    Babylonian exile in 586 BCE. Moral inheritance is different from the other two in that through it, moral,
    ethical, and religious values are conveyed through God''s influence rather
    than through law, but the result of conveyance is just as real. Within the
    Jewish community (and some other communities) there exists what is sometimes
    referred to as a zava''ah or "ethical will", which is a document
    designed to pass wisdom and ethical and moral values from one generation to
    the next. The idea of the ethical will is inspired by Genesis 49:1-33 ,
    where Jacob prophesies over, and seeks to convey blessings to, his gathered
    sons.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'There are three kinds of fear that are recognized in the Scriptures. The
    first kind (exemplified by "fear of God and parents") has to do with having
    profound respect (reverence), and is appropriate - even commanded in those
    and similar applications. The second kind (also appropriate) is the kind
    that is built into us by God, in order to protect us from imminent danger.
    Examples of this kind of fear are our ducking for cover upon being startled
    by a loud discharge, and our holding back from touching a hot object after
    having been previously burned by it. The third kind, the one that the
    Scriptures command against, is the kind where we seek to protect ourselves in
    circumstances where we ought instead to be relying on God. This kind is
    exemplified by fear of man and of unwanted circumstances (e.g. death). We sometimes think of fear as a feeling, and indeed there is a physiological
    component to it. However, God does not command us regarding feelings, but
    rather regarding the choices that we make (in faith) in spite of our
    feelings. That is the teaching of 2 Corinthians 5:7 : ... for we live by trust, not by what we see. (rendered in the New
    King James: For we walk by faith, not by sight. ) The Greek word for "sight" in this Scripture is (pronounced
    " aye-dos "), and refers not only to eyesight, but to all of
    our senses, including those that imbue us with feelings. Fear, worry, and anxiety are similar in that they are the opposite of
    trusting God for our welfare and protection. All three are debilitating and
    open us to spiritual attack, and that is why there are so many Scriptures (in
    both the Tanakh and the Kitvey B''rit Chadasha ) that warn us
    against giving in to fear, and exhort us to have faith instead.'

    houses were flat living areas, and it was intended to keep our families, our
    neighbors, and ourselves safe from falling off. The general principle of this Mitzvah that is derived from Scripture is that we should take
    responsibility for the safety of ourselves and others by removing dangerous
    conditions from areas that are under our control. While most roofs today are
    not flat living spaces, some still are, and there are other conditions of
    danger that we must not allow to exist such as unfenced or uncovered swimming

    offered Himself up as a sacrifice for our sin, was resurrected from the dead,
    and later returned to the Father, sending back to us the Ruach
    Hakodesh to reside within all who are willing to receive Him. The
    prophecy of Jeremiah was thus fulfilled, and we who are living today and
    believe, are its beneficiaries. The Scriptures cited do not use the word "study", but do say "on His Torah they meditate day and night", and "meditate on it all day".
    Also, the Bereans are said to have engaged in "checking the Tanakh every day", all of which are tantamount to studying God''s Word, but even
    exceed mere study because they connote repetition. According to Jeremiah 31:32(33) and Hebrews 8:10 , God puts His
    words within us but, just as with other blessings of God, He doesn''t force
    Himself on us; we have to invite Him. Therefore, we have a responsibility to
    receive and internalize God''s Word or we will derive no benefit from it.
    Internalizing God''s Word is the same as allowing the Ruach HaKodesh to
    live within us, to counsel, comfort, and yes, even convict us of sin should
    we stumble. Although Jeremiah spoke his prophecy to the Jewish people, God''s
    words for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest did not mean just Jews, but Gentiles also ( Romans 2:14-15a ) who, by
    confessing Yeshua, are grafted into an olive tree among Jewish branches
    ( Romans 11:17 ), thereby becoming members in the " national life of
    Isra''el " 1 or " commonwealth of
    Israel ", 2 ( Ephesians 2:12 ) and, consequently, in the wider body of believers. Deuteronomy 6:7 commands us to talk about God''s words (meaning His
    words in Scripture), and it mentions four occasions in particular, which I
    interpret to mean on all occasions. Speaking God''s words has the benefit of
    learning them, remembering them, and teaching them even to those who hear
    them spoken in passing.

    Teaching Torah and Torah -obedience is commanded ( Matthew
    5:19 ), and is expected of all of us. The Mitzvah as it applies to
    our children is especially important, however, because teaching children is
    the way our heritage of belief, obedience, and relationship with God is
    passed from generation to generation. As Proverbs 22:6 tells us: even when old, he will not swerve from it. 1. Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) translation 2. New King James Version (NKJ) translation'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The various Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah speak of trusting him,
    and others speak of believing in him; both infer having faith in him and in
    his Father in heaven who sent him. It is important to understand that the
    kind of faith to which we are called is not mere intellectual belief for we
    read in James 2:19 : You believe that "God is one"? Good for you! The demons believe it too -
    the thought makes them shudder with fear! Our belief must be more than cognitive - it must be a full embracing of
    Yeshua as our Lord and Messiah - no less than what is stated in Romans
    1:8-9 : What, then, does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your
    heart." - that is, the word about trust which we proclaim, namely, that if
    you acknowledge publicly with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and trust in
    your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be delivered. Although pursuing eternal life (salvation) is not commanded, it is a clear
    benefit and result of trusting and believing in Yeshua.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is clear from the foregoing Scriptures (and others not cited) that
    truth-telling is a commanded virtue, and that the opposite of truth-telling
    (lying) is a sin. We know that truth-telling is a godly attribute because in Numbers 23:19 , when under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Balaam
    said to Balak: God is not a human who lies or a mortal who changes his mind. When he says
    something, he will do it; when he makes a promise, he will fulfill it. In complete contrast to God who does not lie, John 8:44 quotes Yeshua
    (scolding a group of Judeans out to kill Him) as saying that Satan is the
    original liar; we read: You belong to your father, Satan, and you want to carry out your father''s
    desires. From the start he was a murderer, and he has never stood by the
    truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he is speaking
    in character; because he is a liar - indeed, the inventor of the lie! This appears to be a reference to Genesis 3:2-4 where Satan (in the
    form of a serpent) lies to Eve about eating from the tree " in the middle
    of the garden " and says to her: It is not true that you will surely die ... In my stating categorically that lying is a sin, I believe I should address
    the often-debated Scripture passages in which Abraham and Isaac were less
    than candid in admitting that Sarah and Rebecca respectively were their
    wives; they are: Genesis 20:2 Avraham was saying of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister"; so Avimelekh
    king of G''rar sent and took Sarah. and Genesis 26:7 The men of the place asked him about his wife, and out of fear he said,
    "She is my sister." He thought, "If I tell them she''s my wife, they might
    kill me in order to take Rivkah. After all, she is a beautiful woman." Apologists for Abraham sometimes use Abraham''s convoluted explanation in Genesis 20:12 to try to show that Abraham didn''t lie because Sarah was
    not only Abraham''s wife, but also his half-sister. The same explanation
    cannot, however, be made for Isaac and, the truth be told, both men lapsed in
    their faith, fearing for themselves and for their wives. Then there is the
    occasion where Rebecca and Jacob conspired to deceive Isaac into blessing
    Jacob instead of Esau. It is one of the unique aspects of the Scriptures,
    that God allows us to see the foibles of even the greatest of the patriarchs.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Waiting on God and having patience are obviously connected. As a matter of
    fact, according to Galatians 5:22 , patience is a fruit of the Spirit.
    So why is exercising patience to wait on God sufficiently problematic so as
    to warrant a mitzvah devoted to it? It is because natural man''s way
    is to be impatient and to seek immediate gratification, so that when natural
    man petitions God for something in prayer, he judges whether or not God has
    answered or will answer his prayer by whether or not he sees immediate
    results. This Mitzvah calls us to exercise faith for God''s timeframe which is
    not the same as ours; consider the following Scriptures: 2 Peter 3:8-9 : Moreover, dear friends, do not ignore
    this: with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years
    like one day. The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some people
    think of slowness; on the contrary, he is patient with you; for it is not his
    purpose that anyone should be destroyed, but that everyone should turn from
    his sins. Ecclesiastes 3:1 : For everything there is a season, a
    right time for every intention under heaven . Acts 1:6-7 : When they [Yeshua and his disciples] were
    together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore
    self-rule to Isra''el?" He answered, "You don''t need to know the dates or the
    times; the Father has kept these under his own authority." Waiting on God builds our faith and our dependence on Him, which are good
    things. Proverbs 3:5-6 expresses it well: Trust in ADONAI with all your heart; do not rely on your own
    understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him; then he will level your
    paths.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'God spoke to Israel through Jeremiah and promised them: I will put my Torah within them and write it on their hearts; I will be
    their God, and they will be my people. ( Jeremiah 31:32b ; Hebrews 8:10 ) Later, God spoke through Ezekiel and said: Ezekiel 36:26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit inside you; I will take
    the stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. This new heart with the Torah embedded in it was to be a clean heart
    with a new Spirit, and it came to fruition as part of the New Covenant and
    man''s "new birth" in Yeshua: John 3:3 "Yes, indeed," Yeshua answered him, "I tell you that unless a person is
    born again from above, he cannot see the Kingdom of God." John 3:6 What is born from the flesh is flesh, and what is born from the Spirit is
    spirit. 2 Corinthians 5:1 Therefore, if anyone is united with the Messiah, he is a new creation -

    orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the

  commentary_rudolph: 'In the foregoing Scriptures, we encounter categories of creatures (and also
    specifically named creatures), some of which are clean and may be eaten, and
    others of which are unclean and may not. Eatability and cleanness generally
    coincide, but they are separate attributes as Leviticus 11:46-47 explains: Such, then, is the law concerning animals, flying creatures, all living
    creatures that move about in the water, and all creatures that swarm on the
    ground. Its purpose is to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and
    between the creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten. The Mosaic commandments specifying which creatures may and may not be eaten
    are generally complied with as an unchallenged part of Messianic Jewish life
    and practice. Nevertheless, the question sometimes arises as to God''s
    rationale for these restrictions and whether today, in the absence of the
    Holy Temple (ceremonial cleanness had to be maintained in the Temple), the
    food restrictions still apply. Those who believe they still apply may offer
    their personal opinions as to why, but Leviticus 20:24b-26 gives us
    God''s reason: I am ADONAI your God, who has set you apart from other peoples. Therefore
    you are to distinguish between clean and unclean animals and between clean
    and unclean birds; do not make yourselves detestable with an animal, bird or
    reptile that I have set apart for you to regard as unclean. Rather, you
    people are to be holy for me; because I, ADONAI, am holy; and I have set you
    apart from the other peoples, so that you can belong to me. Scripture''s reason for the food laws is clearly that Israelites (today called
    Jews) are a holy people set apart, and are therefore commanded to a unique
    lifestyle (including restrictions as to what we are allowed to eat) so that
    we will be seen as set apart. This reason is not Temple-dependent, and is
    therefore as valid today as it was at the time the food commandments were
    given to Moses. Perhaps it is even more important today, because so many of
    the world''s Jews are integrated into the general society and have lost
    visibility. It is my opinion, therefore, that it is God''s will that today''s
    Jews (and the K''rovei Yisrael who dwell in community alongside us)
    continue to obey the biblically commanded restrictions on what may and may
    not be eaten, and that it is sin for us not to do so. There are those who would say that my position is not correct - that Jewish
    believers in Yeshua who aspire to keep the food laws (in fact any laws) are
    rejecting Messiah''s sacrifice and God''s grace, and are putting themselves in
    an unholy bondage. This false theology is discussed in general terms in my
    essay " Elephants in the Room: What Paul Really Meant by His Comments on
    the Law " that is found in the preliminary section of this book. It is beyond the scope of this Mitzvah to discuss the various New
    Covenant Scriptures that are typically used to come against obeying
    God''s food laws in the Torah, but I will mention the main ones for the
    reader''s convenience; they are Mark 7:18-19 ; Acts 10:9-15 and 11:1-9 ; 1 Corinthians 8:8 and 10:25-27 ; Colossians 2:16 ; and 1 Timothy 4:1-5 . How then should today''s Gentile believers respond to the dietary
    commandments? Some say that they should not seek to keep them because doing
    so will diminish Israel''s visible uniqueness as a people set apart
    ( Leviticus 20:24b-26 ). Others say: "If God gave these dietary
    restrictions to his ''chosen people'' they must be good, so I will adopt them
    as well." My opinion is that if Gentile believers voluntarily adhere to the
    biblical food laws as a witness to their grafted-in connection to the Jewish
    people, they are acting appropriately. On the other hand, if they profess
    that the commandments are directed to all believers in Yeshua in order to
    mark them as a holy people analogous to the Jews ( Ephesians 2:11-22 )
    and that they are in sin if they do not keep them, then they would be wrong
    (in my opinion), and would indeed be obscuring Israel''s intended uniqueness.
    It is therefore my opinion that, in general, obedience to the food laws
    (other than those mentioned in Acts 15:19-20 and Acts 21:25 ) by
    Gentiles is optional. In closing, I should like to say a few words about the term " kosher "
    as it applies to the dietary laws - a term that I have thus far intentionally
    not used in this discourse. The word means "allowed", and it is correctly
    used in describing whether the Bible permits a creature to be eaten by an
    Israelite (e.g., "A goat is a kosher animal, whereas a pig is not.").
    The reason I have avoided its use in this Mitzvah , is that the word
    " kosher " has another connotation as well, and that is in stating
    whether the flesh of a particular creature (or a particular substance) is
    allowed to be eaten according to rabbinical standards. So, for example, the
    meat of a goat (which is a kosher animal) is not kosher ,
    according to rabbinical standards, if the goat was not slaughtered
    appropriately, or that the slaughter was not conducted under rabbinical
    supervision. One ought to therefore be alert to how the word " kosher "
    is used in context, so as to elicit its intended meaning.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'In Matthew 10:5-8 we read of how Yeshua''s disciples were sent out to
    minister to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" with Holy Spirit power
    that included power to cast out demons. Earlier in the Scriptures, we see
    numerous examples of Yeshua casting out demons and expecting his disciples to
    do the same. For example, in Matthew 17:20 ( verse 21 in NKJ)
    we read of how, after seeing Yeshua cast out a demon, his disciples were
    perplexed by not being able to cast it out themselves: And he said to them: "Because you have such little trust! Yes! I tell you
    that if you have trust as tiny as a mustard seed, you will be able to say to
    this mountain, ''Move from here to there!'' and it will move; indeed, nothing
    will be impossible for you!" In another Scripture ( Mark 9:28-29 ), we read: After Yeshua had gone indoors, his talmidim asked him privately, "Why
    couldn''t we drive it out?" He said to them "This is the kind of spirit that
    can be driven out only by prayer." Because the Holy Spirit is with us today as he was during and after the time
    of Yeshua, we too have the power to cast out demons in Yeshua''s name. That
    notwithstanding, we are cautioned by the Scriptures that underlay this Mitzvah not to do so if we perceive that the person who is the subject
    of the ministry cannot hold the deliverance due principally to lack of faith
    or continued or un-repented sin.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'We assume that Moses gave this order in compliance with God''s directive, so
    it should be considered Torah . The commandment involves assembling,
    reading aloud (teaching), hearing, and learning. All of these are good and
    necessary to do at times other than Sukkot and other than in the
    Sabbatical Year, but the commandment specifies this particular time, so it
    should be complied with. Since the designated place of assembly was where the
    Ark of God was, it is especially important to conduct the reading in Yerushalayim , at the place where the Temple last stood. Jews
    everywhere should be encouraged to journey there to hear, read, and otherwise
    participate but, for those who cannot, similar assemblies and readings can be
    conducted in synagogues elsewhere and at distant parts of the world. Complying with this Mitzvah today is perhaps more symbolic and
    ceremonial than actually needed to learn the commandments of God because,
    unlike in the time of Moses, synagogues the world over read through the
    entire Torah once a year every year, and printed Bibles are generally
    available to all. That notwithstanding, it is a general principle that
    blessing follows from literally obeying Torah with a heart to please
    God and wherever possible. Because this Mitzvah is so closely related
    to Jewish identity and calling, I consider it to be optional and unnecessary
    for non- k''rov Yisrael Gentiles.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Fear of men''s disapproval is a primary motive when believers deny Yeshua, and
    when unbelievers refuse to consider him. Those feared may be family members,
    employers, co-workers, friends, or even fictitious figments of the
    imagination. Scripture is clear that whether one is a believer or an
    unbeliever, denying the true and full identity of Yeshua (Messiah, son of
    God, fullness of the deity, etc.) is
    sin, 1 and can have disastrous consequences. 1. Unintentional sin in the case of an unbeliever.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Levitical Cohanim (Aaron and his sons) were commanded to bless the
    "People of Israel" (the Jewish People) who, at that time, were the only
    people group in covenant with God. The blessing (referred to today as the Birkat Cohanim or the Aaronic Benediction) was to be given using the
    exact words recorded in Numbers 6:24-26 , the purpose of which was for
    the Cohanim to put God''s Name on the Jewish People, thereby
    identifying whom God Himself would bless. Clearly, God did not need the Cohanim to tell Him who the Jewish People were, so the commandment was
    no doubt intended more as an impartation of authority, informing the Cohanim that what they declared on earth (in the way of blessing)
    would be made a reality in heaven - a concept that was to be reiterated years
    later by Messiah Yeshua (see Matthew 16:19 ). In the New Covenant, all believers in Yeshua are elevated to the status of
    priests ( Cohanim ) under Yeshua ( 1 Peter 2:5-12 ) who, Scripture
    teaches, is our High Priest ( Hebrews 4:14 ; Revelation 1:4-6 ).
    Extrapolating from Numbers 6:22-27 , I therefore conclude that, as was
    required of Aaron and his sons, we who are New Covenant Cohanim ,
    through our belief in Yeshua, are also required to pray blessing upon the
    Jewish People; and not only upon them, but also upon the newest "People of
    God" as well - all who believe in Yeshua - both Jews and non-Jews. And there
    is good biblical evidence that our responsibility to bless does not stop
    there, but extends even to the world''s unbelievers through our bringing them
    the Good News of Yeshua and praying for their salvation ( Matthew 9:36-38,
    28:16-20 ; James 5:16 ). Although Hebrews 8:13 indicates that the Mosaic Covenant is
    diminishing and is in the process of vanishing, it is never said, in
    Scripture, to have already vanished. Without the Temple, Levitical Cohanim today have few functions, but those remaining include
    ceremonially blessing the Jewish People with the Birkat Cohanim ( Numbers 6:22-27 ), receiving special aliyot to read from the Torah , and participating in redeeming a Jewish family''s firstborn son
    ( Pidyon HaBen - Numbers 18:15 ). In Orthodox Judaism, only
    Levitical Cohanim are authorized to minister the Birkat
    Cohanim , but in other denominations, others may do so. In Messianic
    Judaism, for example, it may be prayed over a congregation by a Levitical Cohen if one is available, but often the Rabbi, the Chazan (Cantor), or other officiating leader ministers it at a service''s conclusion
    in reliance upon his New Covenant priestly status. Since the New Covenant
    priesthood is not limited to Jews, Gentile leaders are also authorized to
    minister it. The matter of women leading synagogue services is controversial; in my
    opinion, women should not be in that position of authority and should
    therefore not minister the Birkat HaCohanim . Those that believe
    otherwise, however, rely on the undisputed fact that the New Covenant
    priesthood extends to women as well as to men.'

  commentary_rudolph: '"Judging" is forming an opinion based on evidence or perceived evidence.
    There are two basic kinds of judgment: (1) temporal and (2) eternal, and
    there are three authorities for passing judgment: (1) God, (2) mankind, and
    (3) institutional. Temporal judgment is of the here and now, whereas eternal
    judgment has to do with one''s life with God in the world to come. The
    authorities for eternal judgment are (first and foremost) God, but also batei din (ecclesiastical courts) in which the body of believers
    renders judgments that could have eternal consequences: Matthew 18:15-19 : Moreover, if your brother commits a sin against you, go and show him his
    fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you
    have won back your brother. If he doesn''t listen, take one or two others
    with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or
    three witnesses. If he refuses to hear them, tell the congregation; and if
    he refuses to listen even to the congregation, treat him as you would a pagan
    or a tax-collector. Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on
    earth will be prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be
    permitted in heaven. To repeat, I tell you that if two of you here on earth
    agree about anything people ask, it will be for them from my Father in
    heaven. Temporal judgments are of two levels. The first is "merely forming an
    opinion", and the second is "making a finding"; they may appear the same but
    they are not. The first of these, forming an opinion, may lead to making a
    personal decision such as whether to trust a person or be in a person''s
    company, but it is not, by definition, conveyed to another person lest it
    constitute gossip. Proverbs 20:19 : A gossip goes around revealing secrets, so don''t get involved with a
    talkative person. 2 Corinthians 12:20 : For I am afraid of coming and finding you not the way I want you to be,
    and also of not being found the way you want me to be. I am afraid of finding
    quarreling and jealousy, anger and rivalry, slander and gossip, arrogance and
    disorder. The second level of judging (making a finding), is intended to influence
    others and, if done rightly and officially (e.g. by a bet din ), the
    finding is binding on others such as when a court finds a party guilty or
    innocent of violating a law. There is a difference between judging "rightly", "rightfully", and
    "righteously" (the opposite is judging wrongly, wrongfully, and
    un-righteously): judging "rightly" means making a correct decision, and judging
    "wrongly" means making a wrong decision. A person can be a proper
    person to judge and still make a wrong decision. A similar term, judging "rightfully" (the opposite is "wrongfully")
    has nothing to do with whether a judgment rendered is right or wrong;
    it has to do with whether the person judging is a proper person to do
    it (in legal terms, "has jurisdiction"). An example would be a person
    that witnesses a murder and, without authority, convenes a trial,
    judges, and convicts the murderer. The judgment is right because the
    convicted person did, in fact, commit the crime. However, the person
    judging the murderer has not judged rightly because he or she did not
    have authority to convene the trial and appoint him or herself to be
    the judge. Scripture requires that even when a person judges rightly and
    rightfully, he or she must also judge righteously. That is, the
    person doing the judging must not be in a state of unrepentant sin
    while judging another. Scripture says that if you are yourself guilty
    of that which you judge another, you are a hypocrite and pass judgment
    upon yourself. It is important to understand that, not only are there certain kinds of
    judgments we should not make, but there are certain kinds that are required
    of us. One that is often overlooked is Galatians 6:1 : Brothers, suppose someone is caught doing something wrong. You who have
    the Spirit should set him right, but in a spirit of humility, keeping an eye
    on yourselves so that you won''t be tempted too. And also 1 Corinthians 5:12b : Isn''t it those who are part of the [believing] community that you should
    be judging? In order to be able to correct a fellow believer (or a family member), we
    must first determine that he or she is doing something wrong, and that
    constitutes making a judgment. It is not uncommon for those we seek to
    properly correct to rebuff our correction by quoting Matthew 7:1 which, in the "King James Version", reads: Judge not, that ye be not judged. As impressive as it sounds in the old English vernacular, it is an incorrect
    application of the Scripture if it is spoken in order to avoid the
    correction. The Scripture does not mean that it is improper for believers or
    family members to correct one another. It warns a person who corrects another
    that he or she is held to the same standard of righteousness with which he or
    she is judging. This is made clear if we read further to verse five: Matthew 7:1-5 Don''t judge, so that you won''t be judged. For the way you judge others is
    how you will be judged - the measure with which you measure out will be used
    to measure to you. Why do you see the splinter in your brother''s eye but not
    notice the log in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ''Let me
    take the splinter out of your eye,'' when you have the log in your own eye?
    You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye; then you will see
    clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother''s eye! (CJB) Very wise advice!'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is the general rule that we are to confess our sins, repent, and make
    restitution. Confession is always to God but, according to James
    5:16 , we are also to confess our sins to one another. Confession alone is
    not adequate, however, and we are commanded to repent as well. Repentance
    involves regretting that we sinned, and soberly determining to not repeat the
    sin. A common definition of repentance is "turning away from sin and turning
    toward God." Not all sins are of the kind that the making of restitution is wise,
    reasonable, or even possible. For that reason, we must rely on the Ru''ach Hakodesh to know if, when, and how repentance should be made.
    Regret and repentance, on the other hand, should always occur immediately
    upon realizing that we have sinned. Matthew 5:23-24 requires that when we sin against a brother we
    are to go to him, confess, repent, and attempt to reconcile. Even if we do
    not think we have sinned but our brother does, we should go to him and try
    to reconcile. Although Scripture is not explicit on this point, it would
    seem that we should do so even if the one we sinned against is not a brother,
    but an unbeliever. When that is not possible or appropriate, Scripture still
    requires that we confess our sins to God and to one another, meaning to
    mature brothers and sisters in the faith who will hear us.'

    poured out at the time of its death in order for its meat to be considered kosher . This is specifically commanded in Leviticus 17:13 in
    the case of hunting, and in Deuteronomy 12:15-16 , 23 and 15:20-23 in the case of slaughtering; its purpose is to comply with
    the Scriptures that forbid us from eating
    blood. 4 Each way of harvesting an animal or bird has its own challenges. The kosher way of sh''chitah (practiced by the ancients for
    centuries) is to cut the neck of the creature in such a way that its blood
    pours out, thereby fulfilling this Mitzvah automatically. The wound
    that results from hunting, on the other hand, rarely causes the animal''s or
    bird''s blood to pour from its body, so it must be bled as a separate and
    intentional act. An animal or bird that dies of its own accord
    ( n''veilah ) or is killed by a wild beast in the field ( t''reifah )
    may not be eaten because there is no way to bleed it, and no way to know how
    long it has been dead nor the state of its former health. If it died of its
    own accord, the latter is of obvious concern. The prohibition against slaughtering an animal together with its young on the
    same day ( Leviticus 22:28 ) is a mitzvah of compassion that is
    reflective of God&'' compassion for His creatures. An analogous act of
    compassion is commanded by Deuteronomy 22:6-7 , which forbids us from
    taking a mother bird who is sitting on chicks or eggs; the chicks may be
    taken, but the mother bird must be let go. In today''s developed world, most of us do not slaughter or hunt for our meat;
    instead, we rely on professional slaughterers and butchers and, unless they
    are rabbinically supervised, we have little control over what methods of
    slaughter and bleeding may have been used. One solution is to only purchase kosher meat; if that is not feasible, we ought to make some inquiry
    into how the animals we purchase are slaughtered and their meat processed.
    While certain procedures (such as shock or bolt stunning) used to render an
    animal senseless prior to slaughtering might not satisfy rabbinical standards
    of sh''chitah , bleeding it immediately after it is stunned would
    probably satisfy the biblical standard. Acts 15:27-29 reinforces Genesis 9:3-4 (part of the Noahic Law)
    in making it clear that Gentiles are not to eat meat with the blood still in
    it, in much the same way as Jews are commanded to not to eat blood under the
    Law of Moses 5 . There is a
    common misinterpretation of these Scriptures which are often said to mean
    that one must not eat the limb of a living animal. Certainly one must not,
    but the prohibition is much broader than that; it is against the eating of
    any blood 6 . In my opinion, both Jews and Gentiles are held to the same biblical standard
    of not eating blood, which includes not eating meat from an animal in which
    the blood has not been poured out. As for the other requirements of this Mitzvah , they are mandated for Jews and K''rovei Yisrael ,
    and strongly recommended for other Gentiles. Ritual slaughter (other than
    bleeding) is not biblically required for either Jews or Gentiles. 1. Except in the case of Genesis 9:3-4 , all
    animals and birds referred to in this Mitzvah are assumed to be kosher . 2. This commandment is part
    of the Noahic Law that was intended for Gentiles and given prior to the
    Law of Moses. 3. A slaughterer is known as a shochet . 4. Fish are exempt from the requirements. 5. Under the New Covenant as well. 6. Since meat cannot be divested of all traces of blood,
    see Mitzvah # K4 for efforts that may be taken to
    reduce its blood to an acceptable minimum.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Deuteronomy verses that support this Mitzvah speak of an
    item lost by a brother. Nevertheless, Exodus 23:4 and general
    principles of morality strongly suggest that it must apply to a non-brother
    as well - even an enemy - for otherwise, the finder would be unjustly
    enriched at the expense of the loser. It is therefore logical that if the
    finder knows the loser and does not return the article, his omission amounts
    to constructive theft. Deuteronomy 22:2 contains a departure from many secular laws today
    that permit a finder of lost property to take ownership of it if it is not
    claimed within a specified period of time. Scripture forbids a person from
    ever claiming title to a lost item, even if the owner is unknown or at a
    great distance so that return would be impractical. The finder must keep the
    item safe, and take reasonable steps to discover its owner. It is significant
    that some state governments today also prohibit the finder of property from
    keeping it, by providing that certain kinds of unclaimed property escheats to
    the state if the owner does not come forth to claim it within a prescribed
    period of time. There are no New Covenant Scriptures that speak directly of finding and
    returning lost property, but Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31 should
    nevertheless apply.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Homosexuality in the Bible means any sexual contact with a person of one''s
    own gender. As in much in the Bible, the relevant verses of Scripture read
    as though they are written to men, but the New Covenant Scriptures make it
    clear that they apply to women as well ( Romans 1:26 ). The prohibited
    sexual contact referred to is not limited to physically touching another
    same sex''s genitals; it includes any display, touching, conversation, and
    probably even intentionally evoked personal thoughts of a homosexual nature,
    engaged-in in order to cause sexual arousal. All homosexual acts are sinful. On the other hand, the Scriptures do not call homosexual feelings (or any
    feelings) sin. There are some among us who (for reasons that only God knows)
    were born with a dysfunction such that their sexual feelings are not
    consistent with the gender of their physical genitalia. This is a most
    unhappy condition that they must deal with by control and abstinence (i.e.
    not allowing their actions to fulfill their desires), much as a heterosexual
    person must abstain from heterosexual activity that is scripturally
    prohibited. Persons having homosexual feelings that they do not act on
    should be received within the body of believers without reservation, but
    their condition should be viewed as abnormal, and prayer should not cease for
    their healing. Also, it is important that their congregation''s elders know
    about their condition because any slippage of the flesh in this area is
    almost certain to adversely affect others with whom they relate and come in
    contact. Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch only address male on male homosexuality in
    their mitzvot ; they do not discuss women. They opine that the
    expressions "uncover one''s nakedness" or "lie with" in the Bible mean to have
    sexual contact in which a male''s sex organ is physically inserted into
    another male''s orifice (mouth or anus). This is sometimes referred to as
    "sodomy". Special mention is made here of all three commentators'' peculiar
    interpretation of Leviticus 18:14 , which they interpret as not having
    homosexual relations with one''s father''s brother despite the Scripture
    speaking of one''s father''s brother''s wife. NCLA :

  commentary_rudolph: 'A vow is a promise uttered with deliberate solemnity and it is clear from
    the Scriptures cited above that vows to God may not be broken. There would
    be nothing more to say on the matter were it not for the annual musical
    recitation (in most synagogues) of Kol Nidre , rendered just before
    sundown on the evening of Yom Kippur . Kol Nidre (Sephardic
    pronunciation Kal Nidre ) means "all vows", and is an ancient Aramaic
    legal formula that seeks to nullify all vows made to God, by individuals, in
    the year past and in the year to come. As such, it is a clear and direct
    violation of the intent of Scripture, and many attempts have been made, over
    the years, to expunge the tradition from Jewish practice. Some have sought to justify Kol Nidre by inferring that it originated
    with the "Marranos" during the Spanish Inquisition, in their attempt to
    nullify vows of conversion to Christianity made under extreme duress.
    Although the "Marranos" no doubt used the Kol Nidre formula for that
    purpose, the concept originated at least five hundred years earlier. We know
    this because a similar formula appears in the prayer book of the noted Rabbi
    Amram Gaon (ca. ninth century). The controversy persists within Judaism broadly, but is a settled matter in
    most Messianic Jewish congregations where Kol Nidre is either not sung
    at all, or is replaced by a proclamation of the opposite - a statement
    affirming all vows made in the year past, and our intention to abide by all
    vows that we may make in the year to come. I will say only a few words about Nazirite vows since they are rare today.
    They are vows of special personal dedication to holiness that incorporate
    limitations on one''s lifestyle (e.g. wine and grapes may not be eaten, and
    one''s hair must not be cut), and have a declared date of expiration. I
    mention them in connection with this Mitzvah because they must, as
    with other vows, be kept once made notwithstanding our being in the New
    Covenant.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah applies to the conduct of both men and women. Under the Law of Moses, a woman (and all she touched) during her period of
    menstruation was ceremonially unclean. Although being ceremonially clean or
    unclean has little meaning today in the absence of the Tabernacle or Temple,
    I believe that this Mitzvah not to have sexual relations during a
    woman''s period should be obeyed and the reason is twofold. First, a
    woman cannot become pregnant during her menses, and a prime purpose for
    sexual intercourse is to bear children. Second (which I believe is the
    better reason), all through the Bible, blood is very special to God, and Leviticus 20:18 says that if a woman and a man have sexual relations
    during her period: he has exposed the source of her blood, and she has exposed the source of
    her blood; both of them are to be cut off from their people. We see that in the importance of blood sacrifice, and in the prohibition of
    our eating blood. Leviticus 17:11-14 states: For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you on
    the altar to make atonement for yourselves; for it is the blood that makes
    atonement because of the life. This is why I told the people of
    Isra''el, "None of you is to eat blood, nor is any foreigner living with
    you to eat blood." When someone from the community of Isra''el or one of
    the foreigners living with you hunts and catches game, whether animal or bird
    that may be eaten, he is to pour out its blood and cover it with earth. For
    the life of every creature - its blood is its life. Therefore I said to the
    people of Isra''el, "You are not to eat the blood of any creature,
    because the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it will be cut
    off." I do not believe that the similar penalty of being "cut off" for eating blood
    and for having sexual intercourse with a woman during her period of blood is
    coincidental. Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote a mitzvah that prohibits
    having sexual relations with a woman during her menstruation. NCLA :

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is based on ones that Maimonides and HaChinuch wrote,
    limiting sacrifices to within the Sanctuary court. Their reason for
    highlighting this limitation was that the Israelites were to be reminded to
    not sacrifice to (or in the manner of) foreign Gods. This instruction is
    especially relevant in precluding our conducting sacrifices today at a time
    when there is no Holy Temple, but it gives no hint of whether sacrifices
    might be resumed if (and at such time as) the Temple is rebuilt, nor what
    kind of sacrifices they might be if it is. Clearly, with the sacrifice of
    Yeshua having occurred, they cannot be sacrifices for sin. The few Scriptures included herein that prohibit the use of unauthorized
    altars for sacrifice are but a sampling of many others that are in the Bible.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Fornication is sexual intimacy (sexual contact of any kind) between a man and
    a woman who are not married to each other. One immediately notices that the
    definition is quite broad and encompasses adultery, prostitution, and having
    sexual relations with prohibited persons such as family members. Since these
    other categories are dealt with separately in this compilation, this Mitzvah on fornication will focus on what the Bible has to say about
    sexual intimacy between two unmarried persons where prostitution (conveyance
    of value for sex) is not involved. This kind of fornication sometimes occurs
    between individuals who intend to marry, in which case it is called
    "premarital sex," but it also occurs in casual dating. There are two things that make writing this Mitzvah on fornication a
    challenge. The first is that there is no Hebrew or Greek word in the Bible
    that means "fornication" and nothing else. The other is related to it; it is
    that different translators of the Bible have decided how and when to use the
    word "fornication," and some English translations (e.g. the NIV) opt to use
    other words and do not use the word "fornication" at all. For the above
    reasons, the approach to this subject I have chosen is to list and discuss
    Scriptures that use the word "fornication" regardless of the English
    translation from which they come. In all cases where fornication is mentioned in the English Bible, it either
    prohibits sex outside of marriage, or it is analogized to another activity
    with which God is displeased. This negative attitude toward (or prohibition
    of) sex apart from marriage is inferred by Scriptures in which a high value
    is put on a woman''s virginity. An example of such a Scripture is Leviticus 21:13 : "He [the High Priest] is to marry a virgin ..." Another example is Deuteronomy 22:28-29 : 1 If a man comes upon a girl who is a virgin but who is not engaged, and he
    grabs her and has sexual relations with her, and they are caught in the act,
    then the man who had intercourse with her must give to the girl''s father
    one-and-a-quarter pounds of silver shekels, and she will become his wife,
    because he humiliated her; he may not divorce her as long as he lives. The lesson learned from these Scriptures is that sex between a man and a
    woman outside of marriage is displeasing to God if not outright prohibited;
    nevertheless, the word "fornication" is not used. 1. See also, Deuteronomy 22:13-17 and Revelation 14:3-4 . Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch all wrote mitzvot prohibiting having
    sexual intercourse outside of marriage. NCLA :

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah addresses our governmental, societal, and religious
    institutions (e.g. our national and local governments, our congregations, our
    families, etc.), regarding their contributions to the financial equity for us
    that God intends. Financial equity is not the same thing as financial
    equality; equity is fairness in opportunity, and God addresses this most
    clearly in Deuteronomy 8:18 when He says to the Israelites: No, you are to remember ADONAI your God, because it is he who is giving
    you the power to get wealth, in order to confirm his covenant, which he swore
    to your ancestors, as is happening even today. The "power to get wealth" spoken of in the Scripture is financial
    opportunity, but Scripture is clear that not all of us will achieve wealth,
    for Yeshua said in Matthew 26:11a : The poor you will always have with you ... Exodus 21:2-6 , Exodus 23:10-12 , Leviticus 25:2-34 , and Deuteronomy 15:1-18 , contain commandments that redistributed monetary
    wealth and restored land to its original Israelite owners every seven years
    (the Sh''mitah - the Sabbatical year) and every fifty years (the
    Jubilee year - also a Sh''mitah ) respectively. They also command
    forgiving debts and releasing slaves on Sh''mitah , and the Sh''mitah is a year of rest (analogous to the weekly Sabbath) when the
    Israelites, along with their land and animals, were required to cease from
    work. It was a year when all (including those who were poor) could eat from
    what grew of its own accord, that was the result of the prior six years of
    cultivation. Food could be gathered but not methodically harvested; the
    latter was considered working the land, whereas the former was not. These Scriptures, especially those about the Sh''mitah and the year of
    Jubilee ( Yovel ), difficult as they are with which to comply in today''s
    society, remind us that it is God (and not we) who owns the land and other
    forms of worldly wealth and, if we acquire them, we are required to
    periodically return them so that other individuals and other generations may
    have similar opportunity. This is especially emphasized by the requirement
    that all land sales must be with a right of redemption by either the one who
    sells it or his kin. Some argue against the foregoing by pointing out that the mandated redemption
    or return is not back to God, but rather back to persons and families that
    were previously given the land or, in the case of forgiveness of loans, to
    individual borrowers who had no historic right to retain what they borrowed.
    What causes all of this to make sense is adding to it the biblical mandate of
    stewardship. God ultimately owns everything, and we are mere trustees of
    what He owns and entrusts to us for a time. Our property, both real and
    personal, is temporary and intended for our own use, and also for the use of
    others as we are charged with generosity, and compassion for the needs of our
    neighbors. Whether we are good stewards of God''s wealth depends on how
    wisely and how charitably we use His wealth - how much we use for ourselves
    as compared to how much of it we use to bless others. While this Mitzvah has ramifications for our personal tithing and tzadakah (charitable giving), its purpose is mainly to mandate that we
    employ its principle of economic equity in how we manage our various
    institutions over which we have influence. The relevant Scriptures of the Torah to which I have referred cannot be literally applied today
    because we are subject to the laws of the secular governments under which we
    live that almost never make allowance for them. That notwithstanding, God
    wants us to incorporate the Torah principle of financial equity in the
    institutions that we control, and wherever else we are able.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Jewish People (previously called Israelites and defined as those
    descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), are God''s original and primary
    priesthood to the Gentile nations. This priesthood was proclaimed during the
    time of Moses, and its purpose was (and still is) to bring the Word of God
    (indeed God Himself) to those in the world who do not know Him. By virtue of Yeshua''s sacrifice and the New Covenant that he brought, all who
    receive Yeshua as Lord and savior become affiliated through grafting into a
    "Jewish" olive tree ( Romans 17:11 , etc.), not to lose their original
    intrinsic identities as Jews or non-Jews, but to become members together in a
    new (co-existing) priesthood that has come to be known as the "priesthood of

  commentary_rudolph: 'One assumes that preaching holiness to persons closed to it is a waste of
    time, but Scripture goes beyond that and commands us not to do it because it
    is actually dangerous ( Matthew 7:6 & 10:16-17 ). That does not mean
    that we should refrain from preaching the Word of God to groups and
    individuals in the hope that some who hear it are open. It does however mean
    that we are to exercise discernment regarding the response we get, and not
    pursue those whom it is clear are closed because the Holy Spirit has not
    prepared them. Matthew 15:22-28 illustrates that Yeshua himself abided by the
    principle of this Mitzvah by at first ignoring the pleas of the
    Gentile woman from Canaan whom Yeshua assumed was begging him to heal her
    daughter out of desperation and not out of godly conviction. That would have
    been the case of most Gentiles in those days and Yeshua, having divested
    himself of his powers of deity, did not have insight beyond that of other
    men. However, when the woman responded to his rebuff with godly wisdom,
    Yeshua realized that, despite her being a Gentile she was a woman of faith,
    and he granted her request. Yeshua''s assumption that most Gentiles in those days were not yet ready
    to receive the things of God was why at first, Yeshua sent his disciples only
    to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" with the following instruction: Matthew 10:7-14: &nbps As you go, proclaim, ''The Kingdom of Heaven
    is near,'' heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those afflicted with
    tzara''at, expel demons. You have received without paying, so give without
    asking payment. Don''t take money in your belts, no gold, no silver, no
    copper; and for the trip don''t take a pack, an extra shirt, shoes or a
    walking stick- a worker should be given what he needs. When you come to a
    town or village, look for someone trustworthy and stay with him until you
    leave. When you enter someone''s household, say, ''Shalom aleikhem!'' If the
    home deserves it, let your shalom rest on it; if not, let your shalom return
    to you. But if the people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen
    to you, leave it and shake its dust from your feet! Later on, closer to the time when Yeshua would be returning to the Father and
    sending back the Holy Spirit, he broadened his instruction to his disciples
    to include the Gentiles: Matthew 10:18b-20: All authority in heaven and on earth has
    been given to me. Therefore, go and make people from all nations into
    talmidim, immersing them into the reality of the Father, the Son and the
    Ruach HaKodesh, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded
    you. And remember! I will be with you always, yes, even until the end of the
    age. That notwithstanding, Yeshua''s instruction in verse 14 " But if the
    people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen to you, leave it and
    shake its dust from your feet! " applied to the Gentiles as well.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is natural for members of a community to want to be with, and comfort
    members of a grieving family while they are mourning the loss of a loved
    one. Nevertheless, Leviticus 21:1 prohibits Levitical cohanim from being anywhere near a dead body lest they become ritually unclean and
    unfit for their Temple duties. In modern times, the Scripture has been
    applied in several different ways by different rabbinical authorities,
    including not permitting supposed male descendants of Aaron to be in the
    same room as a dead person, nor even on cemetery grounds. The prohibition of course had a practical purpose when the Tabernacle and
    Temple functioned with the Levitical Priesthood conducting sacrifices, but it
    is not the case today. Nevertheless, in anticipation of the Temple being
    rebuilt ( Ezekiel 40-47 ) and the sacrifices being restored, Orthodox
    and Conservative Judaism continue the practice of not allowing men whom they
    believe are descended from Aaron to come near to a dead body. Reform Judaism
    does not follow the practice because Reform Judaism does not recognize the
    continuity of priestly lineage. Leviticus 21:2-3 is an exception to the prohibition when the deceased
    person is a close relative. Not only is it an exception - it is considered a
    positive commandment by the classical commentators, that a priest allow
    himself to be rendered ritually unclean in that circumstance for the sake of
    his relative. Some Messianic Jewish congregations follow Conservative Judaism in this,
    others do not, and still others have not developed a policy on these issues
    at all. Messianic Jewish scholars and leaders that follow Conservative Jewish
    practices interpret Ezekiel chapters 40-47 to be prophecy, that
    the Holy Temple will eventually be rebuilt, and that certain sacrifices will
    be resumed - possibly conducted by a restored Levitical priesthood. All
    believers in Yeshua know that restored sacrifices cannot be for the
    commission of sin since Yeshua is our sacrifice for sin ( Hebrews 9:11-14;
    10:1-14 ); furthermore, we do not know whether the priests conducting
    sacrifices in a restored Temple will be "Levitical" or of some other priestly
    order. Nevertheless, in compliance with Jewish tradition, Messianic Judaism
    generally follows the practice of shielding "assumed" cohanim from
    being near dead bodies, with the understanding that it is voluntary on their
    part. 1 . This Mitzvah applies only to males. It does not apply to females
    because Leviticus 21:1 refers to "sons of Aaron", and because only
    males served in the Tabernacle and the Holy Temple as priests. Messianic Judaism does not apply this Mitzvah to New Covenant priests
    (i.e. to believers in Yeshua). 1. Since the Temple''s records have been lost, there is
    no official record of whose unbroken patrilineal descent is traceable to
    Aaron. Consequently, family names such as "Cohen", "Kohen", "Cone",
    "Cowen", etc., in addition to family histories and traditions are relied
    upon.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Sabbatical Year is characterized by the releasing of debts that are owed
    to us, 2 and by allowing our land to rest - that is, not cultivating the land or
    harvesting its crops. On the one hand, this Mitzvah can be viewed as
    one of benevolence (" so that the poor among your people can eat ... " Exodus 23:11 ) because (1) crops that grow of their own accord during
    the Sh''mittah are available to the poor for gleaning, and (2)
    Israelite debtors who cannot repay what they have borrowed can be released
    from a lifetime of bondage. On the other hand, I believe that the primary
    reason for the Sabbatical Year is revealed in Deuteronomy 25:20-22 ,
    which promises God''s supernatural provision to those who will obey Him and
    trust Him. A question that naturally comes to mind is how releasing loans and resting
    our land in the Sabbatical Year applies today. I am of the opinion that it
    continues to apply where today''s circumstances are similar to those under
    which the ancient Israelites lived. Furthermore, when it does apply, it
    applies not only to Jews, but also to K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. How
    similar the circumstances need to be are revealed to us by the Ruach
    HaKodesh as we pray for guidance. As for most Gentiles (not K''rovei Yisrael ), I believe that their
    compliance is a blessing but not a requirement; I draw this conclusion (as an
    analogy) from Isaiah 56:1-7 , which promises blessing to the foreigner
    who keeps God''s Sabbaths, but apparently does not require it of him. One
    thing that is certain, however, is that God continues to expect all of us to
    look to Him for provision, rather than to think that we can cause provision
    to come to us through our own efforts. We ought to consider the Sabbatical Year (and God''s other Sabbaths - both
    weekly and annual) to be a test of our faith, because our willingness to
    release loans and to rest our land in the Sabbatical Year (as well as rest
    ourselves on the other Sabbaths), is an indication that we trust God, and are
    willing to rely upon Him. 2. There is a rabbinical document called a pruzbul ,
    by which a private debt is made public by transferring it to a beit

    discharge of a debt in the Sh''mittah .'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Serving our neighbor is meeting his needs in the way that we would want him
    to meet our needs ( Matthew 7:12 ), were our situations reversed. The
    reason that servanthood is critically important is that it comprises specific
    ways to love our neighbor that is never without cost or sacrifice to
    ourselves. When we help our neighbor build because he needs shelter, we give
    of our time that we could otherwise spend on our own needs or pleasures.
    When we give our neighbor food (or money) because he is hungry, we give him a
    valuable resource that we could otherwise consume or spend on ourselves. I
    am reminded of James 2:15-16 : Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food, and someone
    says to him, ''Shalom! Keep warm and eat hearty!'' without giving him what he
    needs, what good does it do? The two examples above are of physical helps, but servanthood often involves
    giving of ourselves in less tangible ways as well, such as correcting,
    counseling, and praying for our neighbor.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The plethora of Scriptures that exhort us to die to our self-interests are
    due to the inclination of fallen man to dwell on himself and to put his
    interests above those of others. Still, we cannot completely ignore aspects
    of our welfare or we cannot live. We have to eat, clothe and shelter
    ourselves, keep from things unhealthy, and petition God to meet our needs
    (yes, petitioning God is most certainly a choice that is in our
    self-interest). Several of the Scriptures cited above speak of "loving
    ourselves", so "dying to self-interest" cannot be an absolute, and we
    therefore need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to determine when and how much
    each is needed. We encounter problems when we step out of God''s will by being legalistic in
    either extreme - (1) putting others before ourselves in inappropriate
    circumstances, or (2) putting ourselves before others in equally
    inappropriate circumstances. A ludicrous example of the first extreme
    (putting another''s need before our own) would be our stopping to feed a
    homeless man in the midst of our being severely injured and in need of
    emergency treatment. An equally ludicrous example of the second extreme
    (putting our self before another), would be our passing by an injured person
    lying in the street because we are hungry and late for dinner. Although
    neither of these examples are realistic, they do point to our need for God to
    cleanse us of unholy self-interest that is common to fallen man, and also to
    our need for Holy Spirit imparted wisdom in balancing our personal needs
    against those of others in the various situations that we encounter.'

  commentary_rudolph: '" From the day after the day of rest - that is, from the day you bring the
    sheaf for waving " is the day we refer to as Yom HaBikkurim - Day
    of Firstfruits ( Leviticus 23:10 ). It is unique among the "designated
    times" listed in Leviticus 23 , in that it is the only one that is not
    a Sabbath. The occurrence of the day we call Shavuot is determined by
    counting from Yom HaBikkurim , and is unique among the Annual Sabbaths
    in being the only one to which Scripture does not assign a particular date on
    the lunar calendar; in that regard, it is similar to the weekly Sabbath. The
    fifty-day count from "the day after the day of rest" (or Sabbath) in Leviticus 23:15-16 is known in Jewish practice as "counting the omer ", and which one of several possible Sabbaths is "day zero" of the
    count, is a subject of ongoing debate. To add complication, Numbers
    28:26 calls Shavu''ot " Yom HaBikkurim " as well, the reason
    being that there were two harvests involved. Jewish orthodoxy has adopted the Pharisaic view that the count should start
    from Nisan 16, the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, thus
    causing Shavuot to always fall on the 6 th day of Sivan . By contrast, many in Messianic Judaism have adopted the
    Sadducean view which is that the count should start on the day after the
    Seventh-Day Sabbath that falls in the midst of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
    This causes the count to begin on the first day of the week (a Sunday), on Yom HaBikkurim , making this day the probable day of Yeshua''s
    resurrection. A result of this is that Shavuot falls on different
    days of the lunar calendar in adjacent years, a consequence that seems to
    have been intended in the Leviticus 23 account. When requiring that there be an animal sacrifice to accompany the grain
    offering of Shavuot , Scripture assumes the existence of a Tabernacle
    (or Temple) and an operating Levitical priesthood. Since we have neither
    today, counting to Shavu''ot and waiving two loaves of bread in the
    synagogue are correct adaptations of the Scripture, and are obligatory for
    both Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. Gentiles of the Nations should
    also keep track of the count because knowing when Shavuot occurs is
    important for connecting them to the Jewish people, and for commemorating the
    Holy Spirit''s appearance in Jerusalem on the Shavuot following
    Yeshua''s resurrection ( Acts 2:1-21, 10:45 ).'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The commandment " You are not to boil a young animal in its mother''s
    milk. " forms the basis for a number of halachic rules that include
    not mixing milk with meat, not eating foods that contain both milk and meat,
    and abstaining from eating milk and meat at the same meal or within some
    hours of each other. This illustrates the rabbinical principle of "building
    a fence around the Law" in which rules are promulgated that are more
    stringent than those of the Torah , ostensibly to keep one from
    violating the commandment itself. The problem with this particular fence is (1) no one accidently cooks a young
    animal in its own mother''s milk, and (2) keeping the rules of kashrut regarding milk and meat have so overtaken the attention of Orthodox Judaism,
    that the underlying moral message in the Scripture has been all but lost.
    What is that moral message? It most probably is "Don''t do cruel things to
    God''s creatures as the heathen do." I say "most probably" because we have no absolute proof that boiling young
    animals in their mother''s milk was a heathen practice. Nevertheless, it was
    certainly not a Jewish practice, so whose practice would it otherwise be? We
    know that heathens sacrificed children to their gods by fire ( Leviticus
    18:21 ), and how very similar it is to kill a mother''s child (albeit an
    animal mother) by boiling it in her own milk - milk of her body that was
    meant to nurture it, not kill it. It is as though the mother herself had
    killed her child! I believe the commandment "You are not to boil a young animal in its mother''s
    milk" is an idiom that was very well understood in Moses'' day as meaning:
    "Don''t do cruel things to God''s creatures as the heathen do." The reason I
    believe it is an idiom meant to be interpreted broadly, is because it appears
    three times in Scripture, and all three times it is appended (almost as an
    afterthought that doesn''t quite fit) to commandments associated with our
    treatment of animals. In Exodus 23:17-19 and Exodus 34:23-26 ,
    the commandment follows instructions involving blood sacrifices, and in Deuteronomy 14:21 , it follows an extensive exposition regarding our
    use of living creatures for food. It is also meaningful that Abraham saw no
    problem in serving his guests a meal prepared with milk and meat ( Genesis
    18:7-8 ), and his guests, who were (at the very least) God''s emissaries,
    ate it. What does this mean for Messianic Jewish practice? First, and quite
    obviously, we must not boil a young animal in its mother''s milk. Second and
    most important though, we must treat all of God''s creatures with humane
    kindness - especially those that we domestically raise for slaughter; this Mitzvah stands for that above all. Whether or to what degree we comply with Orthodox halachah regarding
    the mixing of milk and meat is entirely a matter of choice and not of
    commandment, but there are some situations where compliance is appropriate
    and even needed. One that comes to mind is where we live within, or are part
    of, a Jewish community that keeps rabbinically kosher . Another is
    where hospitality requires it because a guest whom we wish to accommodate
    keeps some level of kashrut , and will be constrained in what he can
    eat at our table if we serve meat and dairy at the same meal. Still a third
    is where (while recognizing our liberty to do otherwise) keeping kosher helps us in maintaining our identity as Jews. Although the practice of not mixing milk and meat is most commonly associated
    with Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, this Mitzvah , with its
    emphasis on morality, is as applicable to Gentiles as it is to Jews. The
    only thing that does not apply to a Gentiles is keeping halachically
    kosher as a help in maintaining Jewish identity (since there is none).
    The reasoning might, however, apply to K''rovei Yisrael Gentiles
    who find that keeping halachically kosher is helpful in maintaining
    their K''rov identity within the Jewish community.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'It is a common misunderstanding to believe that God''s covenant with Abraham
    (repeated through Isaac and Jacob) applies only to Jews. The Abrahamic
    Covenant defines the Jewish people generationally, but it is also the
    framework for Gentiles to willfully connect themselves to the Jewish people,
    thereby enlarging the "people of God" that comprises both Jews and Gentiles.
    It is why God told Abraham that he would be the " father of many
    nations. " ( Genesis 17:4 ). That notwithstanding, Gentiles (even K''rovei Yisrael - those closely connected to a Jewish community) are
    not themselves Jews because their priestly identity and covenantal
    responsibilities are not inherited, but are rather, voluntarily derived from
    their connection to the Jewish People through their covenant with the Jewish
    Messiah. In the Mosaic Covenant, Gentiles who wanted a special covenantal
    relationship with God received it by physically moving into the Jewish camp,
    becoming circumcised, sacrificing at the Tabernacle or Temple, and becoming
    part of the Jewish community. In the New Covenant, Gentiles who want a
    special covenantal relationship with God receive it by becoming grafted into
    the "Jewish" olive tree through faith in Messiah Yeshua (see Romans
    the "Jewish" olive tree through faith in Messiah Yeshua (see Romans
    11 ). 1 B''rit milah (covenant circumcision) was (and still is) required of all
    Jewish males who are eight days old lest they be cut off from the covenant
    they have inherited. In the Mosaic Covenant, circumcision was required of
    any Gentile male who lived in a Jewish household and wished to covenantally
    connect to the Jewish people. Such a Gentile became subject to most of the
    commandments of Torah , but it did not result in his becoming a Jew or
    a Jewish
    convert, 2 and it is clear from Acts 15:1-20 that circumcision was not required
    for their salvation. Circumcising a Jewish child has historically been considered the duty of the
    child''s father, but an experienced circumciser (a mohel ) is often
    employed. The surgery can be performed by a non-Jew, but only a Jew can
    receive the child into the covenant. The prevailing view is that b''rit
    milah should be done on the eighth day after birth when possible. So
    important is this eighth day principle, that halachah requires that
    circumcision be performed on that day even if it falls on a Sabbath. 1. Jewish individuals who have been broken off of their
    olive tree through unbelief have to be re-grafted. Jews that remain
    unconnected to their tree retain their covenantal responsibilities but not
    their salvific relationship with God. 2. Uncircumcised Gentiles can participate in
    today''s Passover seders because today''s seders do
    not include eating a sacrificed Passover animal (see Exodus
    12:43-49 ). In 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 , Paul makes it clear that
    Yeshua is our sacrificed lamb, and he thereby encourages the Gentiles to
    whom he is speaking to celebrate the seder . We do not require that K''rov Yisrael Gentiles be circumcised.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'God''s first commandment ever was His instruction to Adam and Eve to not eat
    from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve was tempted by the
    serpent to eat of the tree and she did, and she tempted Adam, and he ate as
    well. That is what is often referred to as the "original sin", and one of
    its consequences is that mankind has been plagued by temptation to sin ever
    since. We have lost our innocence of not knowing evil and there is no longer the
    tree of the knowledge of good and evil to tempt us, but other temptations to
    sin abound. That''s the bad news. The good news is that God has given us
    Yeshua, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the New Covenant which, together,
    are more than adequate to keep us from falling into temptation and committing
    sin. The two Scriptures that are most relevant are 1 Corinthians
    10:13 and James 4:7 . The first assures us that God will not allow
    us to be tempted beyond our ability to cope, and that He will, in addition,
    always provide a means of escape. The second Scripture assures us that Satan
    cannot lodge within us, or continue to harass us, if we summon the power
    given us by God and resist. Notice that neither Scripture calls us to
    passivity. The first requires that we search for and employ the means of
    escape provided for us, and the second requires that we actively resist the
    sin of which we are tempted, by emphatically saying "no!" to it. If we do
    those things we are promised victory, and even should we fail at times, 1
    John 1:9 promises us: If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he is trustworthy and just, he
    will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Hebrew word for "peace" is " shalom ," and the Greek word is
    " ireinei ." Ireinei connotes harmony and tranquility, while shalom includes that, but also connotes completeness and soundness.
    Neither of the words is limited to the absence of turmoil and strife.
    "Peace" is an attribute of God with which He desires to bless us, for we read
    in Philippians 4:7 : Then God''s shalom, passing all understanding, will keep your hearts and
    minds safe in union with the Messiah Yeshua. God created us in His image and, as with so many of God''s attributes, He
    desires that, over time, we develop to become more like Him. A first step in
    emulating God in His attribute of peace is to acquire it from Him. The next
    step is to live in peace with our neighbor, and the ultimate step is to
    actively pursue peace and become a peacemaker. Considering the expanded
    definition of "peace" in the Hebrew and Greek, being a peacemaker is more
    than mediating conflicts (although it is a part). Being a peacemaker, from a
    Biblical perspective, involves caring for our neighbor in such a way as to
    enhance his completeness, his tranquility, and his safety.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Hospitality is often thought of as inviting people into our homes, feeding
    them, and giving them lodging. That is, of course, hospitality, but
    hospitality is broader than that - it is giving of oneself, often at a cost.
    It stands alongside of charity and generosity as being among the most
    important attributes of a believer because it requires that we put the needs
    of others before our own, and puts into practice the most important and
    overarching mitzvot , quoted by Yeshua in Matthew 22:37b-40 : ''You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all your
    soul and with all your strength.'' This is the greatest and most important
    mitzvah. And a second is similar to it, ''You are to love your neighbor as
    yourself.'' All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on these two
    mitzvot. Loving our neighbor (including our loved ones) involves self-sacrifice.
    Sometimes the sacrifice is miniscule and sometimes it is very great. However,
    the willingness and even desire to do it is the very nature of God Himself.
    The number of Scriptures I have found to cite is a testimony of how important
    God considers hospitality.'

    calls us to despise a person''s sin while having love and compassion for the
    person himself: Jude 1:21-23 : Thus keep yourselves in God''s love, as you wait for our Lord Yeshua
    the Messiah to give you the mercy that leads to eternal life. Rebuke some
    who are disputing; save others, snatching them out of the fire; and to yet
    others, show mercy, but with fear, hating even the clothes stained by their

  commentary_rudolph: 'One of the most significant aspects of the New Covenant brought by Yeshua''s
    sacrificial death and resurrection is elevating to priesthood, those of us
    that repent of our sins and receive him as Lord. In the Mosaic Covenant,
    Israel was made by God to be a kingdom of priests, and later in the New
    Covenant, he extended priesthood (not the same priesthood) to all believers
    in Yeshua - Jews and Gentiles alike. There was another priesthood that was part of the Mosaic Covenant - the
    Levitical Priesthood - in which Aaron was the High Priest. Only Aaron could
    enter the Most Holy Place and then, only once a year on Yom Kippur .
    Under the Levitical Priesthood, ordinary priests could not enter the Most
    Holy Place, and were therefore limited in how close to God they could come.
    Today''s Priesthood of Believers is a superior priesthood in that through our
    High Priest Yeshua, all believers in Yeshua can enter the Most Holy Place in
    Heaven, and draw closer to God than the Levitical priests could. It is one
    of the reasons that Hebrews 8:6 can state: But now the work Yeshua has been given to do is far superior to theirs,
    just as the covenant he mediates is better. For this covenant has been given
    as Torah on the basis of better promises.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Leviticus 11, 21, and 22 Scriptures quoted above are cited by
    Maimonides and HaChinuch as cumulatively commanding the Levitical cohanim of old to refrain from ministering in the Holy Sanctuary while
    they are ceremonially unclean. I have expressed my view elsewhere in this
    book, that ceremonial cleanness (ritual purity) in the Tabernacle and Holy
    Temple of old are analogous to repentant holiness today when our New Covenant
    Temples are not of brick and mortar, but are our physical bodies ( 1
    Corinthians 3:16-17 ). Since Scripture teaches that we who are Yeshua''s
    disciples are priests under His New Covenant Priesthood ( 1 Peter 2:4-5,
    9-10 ), how much more must the commandment to the Levitical cohanim apply to us! We must therefore refrain from ministering to others while we
    ourselves are spiritually unclean and in need of repentance. That is not an
    invitation to "stop ministering" - it is a commandment to "repent before
    ministering." This principle that a priest had to be spiritually clean before he could
    minister in the Temple was operative even as far back as Moses. We find a
    powerful example of this in Leviticus 16:5-11, 15-19 , which commands
    the Cohen Gadol (on Yom Kippur ) to first sacrifice a bull for
    himself and his family before he could conduct sacrifices in behalf of the
    people of Israel. Matthew 5:23-24 teaches that if we have sinned
    against our brother (or he thinks we have), we are to make things right with
    our brother (i.e. repent of our sin and reconcile with him) even before
    presenting our offering to God. That of course speaks of a time when animal
    sacrifices were still being offered in the Holy Temple, but the application
    for today is clear: We should not think that we can have a reconciled
    relationship with our Father in heaven without first repenting of our sins
    and reconciling with our brother on earth. Matthew 7:3-5 and Luke 6:41-42 teach a related lesson using the
    example of a splinter in the eye - something with which we are all familiar.
    The smallest splinter in our eye is so disabling to our sight that it might
    as well be an entire log. The splinter and log are symbolic of sin, and we
    are instructed to correct ourselves and repent of our own sin (that blocks
    our sight and judgment) before we are qualified and able to minister
    correction and repentance to our brother.'

    other Scriptures refer to our earthly fathers, teachers, and leaders, and
    since John does not object to being called "rabbi" in John 3:26 ,
    Yeshua cannot be saying that we should not appropriately acknowledge our
    earthly fathers, teachers, leaders, and ordained rabbis. He is instead
    saying that we are to acknowledge our Father in heaven as our supreme father,
    and only him (Yeshua) as our supreme rabbi, teacher, & leader. The context is
    Yeshua criticizing Torah -teachers and the P''rushim who are
    using titles to elevate their stature, and doing things in public in order to

  commentary_rudolph: 'A common feature of the Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah is that
    they speak against conduct that detracts from some aspect of God''s holy
    order. By "holy order" I mean the natural order of things from the creation,
    before the "Fall", that reflects God''s will and perfection. One would hope
    that the Scriptures cited are self-evident and that man would want to obey
    them. Sadly, however, there are many perversions rampant in today''s society,
    and ungodly forces agitating to hold them out as acceptable. The Scriptures that teach against wearing two species of thread (animal wool
    and vegetable linen) or sowing two species of seeds are symbolic of not
    mating two species of animals. With modern manufactured clothing such as we
    wear, it is not possible to know what kinds of threads have been used to make
    our clothing, but modern clothing is not known to combine wool and linen. Today there is no universal standard of what constitutes a male or female
    garment. It is defined by the culture in which the garment is worn, and
    tends to change over time. For example, women in the western countries wear
    slacks, whereas in years gone by they did not because slacks were then
    thought to be for men only. The prohibitions against marking one''s skin, cutting one''s flesh, and
    trimming one''s hair and beard in certain styles deserve special mention
    because tattooing, body piercing, and bizarre hair styles have become
    increasingly popular. The commandments prohibiting them were given at a time
    when each of them was a recognized heathen practice, and anyone who exhibited
    any one of them was, essentially, declaring himself to be an idolater.
    Castration also mars the body, but its affect is more profound and will be
    dealt with separately elsewhere. It is still the case that permanent markings, disfigurements, extreme hair
    styles, and cross-dressing are with us today. Idol worship in its classical
    sense is no longer the issue, but rebellion against godly norms is, as is
    illustrated by "Punk" and "Goth" appearances that emphasize darkness over
    light. In addition, tattooing, cutting, and gross piercing permanently
    disfigures the body that God gave us and, for that reason, should be
    understood to not be God''s will despite any religious theme (e.g. a cross)
    that a tattoo or item of jewelry attached to piercings may have. A believer
    who receives one of these knowing beforehand that Scripture prohibits them
    commits sin; one who receives a tattoo innocently has not committed sin, but
    he or she should refrain from making it visibly obvious because of what it
    implies. Once a tattoo has been received it is permanent, and if the wearer
    repents in Yeshua, any sin that may have been committed concerning it is over
    and done with. In my opinion, there is no continuing responsibility to
    attempt to remove a tattoo surgically.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah requires that no leaven, whether alone or part of food
    containing leaven ( chametz ), be in a Jew''s possession or within his
    control during the seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This implies
    that he (or she) must, before sundown on the 14 th day of Nisan , remove it from his house, garage, shed, trash bin,
    business property, territory domain, or anywhere else where he has
    proprietary rights of control, and must not let it back in for seven full
    days. This abstinence commemorates the Jews'' hasty departure from Egypt,
    when they had no time to allow their bread to rise and therefore had to eat
    unleavened bread on the first leg of their journey. According to Exodus
    12:19 , obedience to this commandment is not an option for either a Jew or
    a Gentile who is a " citizen of the land " ( K''rov Yisrael ). Leaven is analogized to sin in 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 and in Galatians
    5:7-9 , and its removal from our lives is directly linked to the Passover,
    and to the Passover lamb - our Messiah. But leaven is not always symbolic of
    sin, as we can see from Leviticus 23:17 , which requires that the
    firstfruits bread offering of Shavuot be made with leaven. The particulars of what should be considered leaven and chametz are
    controversial within Jewry. Sephardim and Ashkenazim follow
    different rules on the subject, and Messianic Jewish communities are equally
    diverse. Is leaven anything that can cause food to rise, or must there be
    fermentation in order for it to qualify? What grains must be removed from
    the house because they are subject to spontaneous fermentation during
    storage? Rice? Barley? Beans? Discussions of such particulars are found in
    the Talmudic literature, but not in any of the classical mitzvah codifications. I do not think it would be judicious for me
    to express my opinion of these particulars here. The general idea in the
    Scriptures is that the Israelites'' bread that would otherwise have
    fermented with yeast did not have time to rise. Therefore, our not keeping
    casually-stored grains that would have had time to ferment and rise would
    seem to be the general intent of the biblical text. The legal fiction, in which people sometimes engage, of keeping control of
    their chametz (whether stored in their house or not) by selling it to
    a Gentile for a minimum amount of money with the understanding that the
    Gentile will sell it back to them after the days of Unleavened Bread is not
    in accord with the spirit of the Scriptures. People should gauge their
    purchases and production of leavened products so as to minimize their
    material loss, but they should not engage in subterfuge. This Mitzvah is mandated for Jews and K''rovei Yisrael ,
    but not for Gentiles generally; the text of 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 cited
    above is therefore metaphorical in its application as to them.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Forgiveness in Jewish Tradition While there is no explicit commandment in the Torah requiring that we
    forgive our brother, there is one Scripture, Leviticus 19:17 , that
    implicitly means the same thing: Do not hate your brother in your heart, but rebuke your neighbor frankly,
    so that you won''t carry sin because of him. Don''t take vengeance
    on or bear a grudge against any of your people; rather, love your neighbor as
    yourself; I am ADONAI. Rabbinical literature endorses the principle of forgiving others, and gives Genesis 50:16-21 (Yosef''s forgiveness of his brothers) as the example
    we are to follow. Beyond that, all other references to forgiveness are
    rabbinic, and include: Mishnah : Yoma 8:9; Baba Kama (92a) 8:5 Talmud : Yoma 86b; Rosh HaShana 17a; Ta''anith 20a,b; Beitz 32b;

    are not one, but two kinds of forgiveness - unconditional and conditional -
    and our responsibility to forgive others is different for each of them. Unconditional Forgiveness 2 I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in Mark 11:25 3 " unconditional Forgiveness ": And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive
    him; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses. Notice that this kind of forgiveness is truly without condition, and is to be
    granted, not only to brothers in the Lord, but to anyone who has sinned
    against us and hurt us. It does not seek to judge the offender, nor does it
    require that the offender be repentant. It must be given as soon as possible
    after the offense is committed, so that bitterness does not take root within
    us and do spiritual damage. This kind of forgiveness is essentially a
    releasing of the matter to God, and does not retain anger or a desire for
    personal vengeance (see Ephesians 4:31-32 ). Unconditional forgiveness
    is a manifestation of godly love that we are to give, even to our enemies
    ( Luke 6:27-32 ). Yeshua illustrated this kind of forgiveness when, in Luke 23:34a , He beseeched His Father in heaven to forgive His Roman
    soldier executioners who were, even at that moment, subjecting Him to an
    unjust and painful death. Our granting unconditional forgiveness, and not harboring bitterness against
    those who have sinned against us, purges us of unholy attitudes that may have
    resulted from our being victimized, and opens the way for God to forgive us
    for our sins as well. Conversely, if we do not grant unconditional
    forgiveness, Mark 11:25 4 , Matthew 6:14-15 ,
    and Luke 6:37 convey the certainty that God will not forgive us
    either. Granting unconditional forgiveness does not, however, mean that the
    relationship or trust between persons is restored. It only means that the
    person who has forgiven has freed himself from the anger of vengeance, and
    has a heart to see the person who has sinned against him repent so that he
    might be blessed by God. Conditional Forgiveness I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in Luke 17:3-4 " Conditional Forgiveness ". 5 Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents,
    forgive him. Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven
    times he comes to you and says, ''I repent,'' you are to forgive him. Conditional forgiveness is different from unconditional forgiveness in
    several ways that the Luke Scripture illustrates. First, conditional
    forgiveness applies only to brother believers. 6 Second, whereas unconditional forgiveness must be given whether or not there
    is repentance, conditional forgiveness is only granted if the offending
    brother repents, and the brother who has been sinned against is required to
    judge whether the offending brother has repented before the offended brother
    forgives him. And it is different in another way as well, which is
    illustrated in John 20:23 which states: If you forgive someone''s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you hold them,
    they are held. Here you see that if one who is sinned-against, judges that his offending
    brother is repentant and forgives him, God also forgives the offending
    brother. Conversely, if one who is sinned against withholds forgiveness
    because, in his judgment, his brother is not repentant, then God honors the
    judgment and does not forgive the offending brother either. One may ask why John 20:23 applies only as between believers since the Scripture
    doesn''t say that! It is because the verse involves judging, and 1
    Corinthians 5:12-13 allows us to judge those who are within the body of
    believers, but not those who are outside. Forgiveness Has No Limits There is no maximum number of times that we must forgive those who sin
    against us, even if they do so repeatedly. There are no limits on our
    granting unconditional or conditional forgiveness so that we might walk in
    holy attitudes and continuous forgiveness ourselves. As previously stated in Luke 17:4 : Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times he
    comes to you and says, ''I repent,'' you are to forgive him. And similarly in Matthew 18:21-22 : Then Kefa came up and said to him, "Rabbi, how often can my brother sin
    against me and I have to forgive him? As many as seven times?" "No, not
    seven times," answered Yeshua, "but seventy times seven!" Scripture''s requirement that we forgive does not negate our responsibility to
    cooperate with public authorities when matters of justice or the protection
    of others is involved. 2. Sometimes termed "Personal
    Forgiveness" 3. In
    other translations, verses 25-26 4. Ibid. 5. It has sometimes been referred
    to as "Transactional Forgiveness". 6. Understand that
    everything said about a brother believer applies to a sister as well.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Today, the Holy Spirit is so identified with the New Covenant, that the
    reality of the Spirit''s ministry among men going back to creation is often
    overlooked. Except for historical studies, the rabbinical community and much
    of the Christian Church ignores the Holy Spirit, and relegates His work among
    men to the distant past. In fact, none of the Covenants that God made with
    men throughout the ages could have existed without the Holy Spirit, because
    the Holy Spirit has always been the entity that allowed men to interact with
    God the Father. The order of the Scriptures presented in this Mitzvah shows the work
    of the Holy Spirit at various stages of history, and it is striking how
    similar and consistent His work has always been. He has always descended upon
    men, lived within men, filled men, empowered men, gifted men, counseled and
    led men and, enabled communication between men and God. The uniqueness of the
    New Covenant in regard to the Holy Spirit is not the newness of His work, but
    rather with whom He now interacts, and the intensity of the interaction.
    Prior to the New Covenant, the Holy Spirit enabled all men to speak to God
    (generally through prayer), but God was very particular about to whom He
    spoke back. He conversed with Adam, Noah, the patriarchs, Moses, and others,
    but they were always persons selected at His discretion. We call persons
    prophets if it is their function to hear God, and to repeat what they hear to
    others. As marvelous as God''s early form of interaction with men was, it was limited
    because the ordinary Israelite did not have general access to the Holy
    Spirit, and therefore had to consult with those that did have access, if he
    wanted to receive God''s guidance. It was like having a father whom you have
    never met, and with whom you can only converse by way of a messenger. That limitation changed dramatically in the New Covenant, when God fulfilled
    His promise through Joel to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh ( Joel 3:1
    (2:28) ). Today, we are blessed to be able to relate to our heavenly
    father in a direct and personal way, and to be able to have conversations
    with Him, not only by our speaking to Him, but also by Him speaking back to
    us. Through the New Covenant, we have gained a relationship with God that
    most of us would not have had, had we lived prior to the time of Yeshua. Now that brings me to Yeshua, of whom I have not yet spoken. Yeshua is a
    critical part of the New Covenant, because His atoning sacrifice for us is
    what enables us to be cleansed of sin so that the Holy Spirit can live within
    us. Without Yeshua, we could not receive the Holy Spirit, and that is why Hebrews 9:13-15 says of Him, that He is the mediator of a New
    Covenant: For if sprinkling ceremonially unclean persons with the blood of goats and
    bulls and the ashes of a heifer restores their outward purity; then how much
    more the blood of the Messiah, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered
    himself to God as a sacrifice without blemish, will purify our conscience
    from works that lead to death, so that we can serve the living God! It is
    because of this death that he is mediator of a new covenant [or will].
    Because a death has occurred which sets people free from the transgressions
    committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive
    the promised eternal inheritance. There are two ways that we can utilize the gifts of the Holy Spirit that have
    been given to us in the New Covenant. We can use the gifts to enhance our
    personal lives, and we can use them to enhance the lives of others. There are
    a few among us who are specially gifted to equip others for ministry, and
    these we sometimes call the "fivefold gift ministers", a term that refers to
    the five ministries listed in Ephesians 4:11-12 . Furthermore, he gave some people as emissaries, some as prophets, some as
    proclaimers of the Good News, and some as shepherds and teachers. Their task
    is to equip God''s people for the work of service that builds the body of
    the Messiah ... Among the gifts of the Spirit, tongues tends to be the most spoken about
    because of confusion that has resulted from incorrect teaching. Three
    incorrect things that I have most often heard taught about tongues are: Speaking in tongues was a spiritual gift for the past only - not for
    today (this is sometimes said about all of the gifts of the Spirit). Those who do not speak in tongues are not saved. Speaking in tongues is a sign that one has been filled with (baptized
    in) the Holy Spirit, and those who do not speak in tongues have not been
    filled. I hope and trust that my earlier reference to 1 Corinthians 12:28-30 is sufficient to put the lie to #2 and #3 above: And God has placed in the Messianic Community first, emissaries; second,
    prophets; third, teachers; then those who work miracles; then those with
    gifts of healing; those with ability to help; those skilled in
    administration; and those who speak in various tongues. Not all are
    emissaries, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? or teachers? or
    miracle-workers? Not all have gifts of healing, not all speak in tongues,
    not all interpret, do they?) As for #1 above, and other gifts of the Holy Spirit, suffice it to say that
    the New Covenant, as we know it, could not exist without them. Now just a bit more about the "immersion" or "baptism of the Holy Spirit".
    First, the word "of" is incorrect, because it is not the Holy Spirit that
    Immerses - it is Yeshua that immerses us in the Holy Spirit ( Matthew
    3:11 , etc.). More importantly, several Christian denominations teach
    that the "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" is a singular event of filling of
    the Spirit - a second work of grace that necessarily comes after one is born
    again. Both Scripture and life''s experiences testify that immersion in the
    Spirit need not be just a one-time occurrence ( Acts 9:22 and Ephesians 5:18-20 ), and it need not be a distinguishable second event
    after salvation because one can be filled with the Holy Spirit at the very
    moment that one is "born again". Consider Cornelius the God-fearer and others
    present when Peter preached the Good News of Yeshua in Cornelius'' home: Acts 10:44 Kefa was still saying these things when the Ruach HaKodesh fell on all who
    were hearing the message. Filling and refilling with the Holy Spirit can occur periodically throughout
    one''s life.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The requirement that God''s people give to the poor ( tz''dakah ) is found
    throughout the Bible. At the time of Moses, Israel was an agrarian society,
    so a major way of providing for the poor was by leaving a portion of each
    field and vineyard un-harvested and by not picking up grapes or grain that
    fell to the ground. By the time of Yeshua, Israel was still agricultural but
    was already moving toward using money for tz''dakah . Today, most of the
    world''s population does not live in a farm environment, and wages paid in
    money has largely replaced being paid in produce and goods. Nevertheless,
    the principle of the Mosaic commandments to set aside a part of our increase
    for the poor is still God''s will. The first Corinthian Scripture cited above makes mention of setting aside
    money for the Apostle Sha''ul to bring to God''s people in Jerusalem. In
    addition to it being required by Torah , giving tz''dakah is a
    time-honored practice in Jewish homes where a tz''dakah box for spare
    coins is often in plain view. It is my opinion that tz''dakah should
    always be in addition to other giving that is required of us such as our
    tithes and other offerings, and it should be noted that, according to Torah , part of the tithe must also be set aside for the poor.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'What is common to tzitzit , tefillin , & mezuzot , is that
    all three are visible reminders of the Word of God, and teaching and
    remembering God''s Word through their use appears to be a Jewish covenant
    responsibility. The question that must be answered, however, is whether tefillin (phylacteries) and tzitzit (fringes) must be
    physically worn (and in what circumstances), and mezuzot physically
    affixed to our doorposts and gates, or whether the Scriptural commandments
    regarding them are intended to be metaphoric. Orthodox Judaism has concluded
    that they are all meant to be physically applied, while the Conservative and
    Reform Jewish community has concluded that the requirement of mezuzot is physical, and the others are symbolic or metaphoric. Practical as this
    latter interpretation seems to be, it is not likely correct because the
    commandments regarding tefillin and mezuzot are contained in
    the very same verses of Scripture, and they should both, therefore, be
    understood to be either one way or the other. My conclusion is that the tefillin and mezuzot are meant to be metaphoric but the
    requirement to wear fringes with a cord of blue is meant to be physical.
    Putting God''s words on our foreheads and tying them to our arms most likely
    means that God should always be in our thoughts and in what we do, and
    writing them on our door-frames most likely means that our homes should be
    dedicated to all that is godly. No harm is done, however, if one elects to
    apply them all physically, or to physically wear tzitzit and display mezuzot but decline to wear tefillin . This is one of those calls that (short of God revealing it prophetically)
    cannot be proven, but I offer several considerations that lean to the
    literal. First, hanging a m''zuzah on the doorpost of a house has the
    actual effect of reminding those who enter of God''s commandments and that
    only holy thoughts and deeds are welcome within. Second, because displaying m''zuzot is entirely a Jewish custom, it has the additional benefit of
    announcing to all who enter that sons and daughters of the Covenant live
    there, thus promoting God''s primary purpose for Israel, which is to be a
    nation of priests and a light to the Gentiles. I cannot help but think of another occasion in the Scriptures where the
    children of Israel were commanded to put something on the doorposts of their
    homes - the blood of the Pesachi - the Passover lamb sacrifice as
    described in Exodus 12:7, 13 : They are to take some of the blood and smear it on the two sides and top
    of the door-frame at the entrance of the house in which they eat it ... The
    blood will serve you as a sign marking the houses where you are; when I see
    the blood, I will pass over you - when I strike the land of Egypt, the death
    blow will not strike you. Although one can see how God''s instruction to the Israelites could have been
    interpreted metaphorically (as in the case of the Deuteronomy 6 and 11 mitzvah ), several things were accomplished by their complying
    literally. First, it served to identify the houses'' occupants as believers
    in God and trusters in His Word. Second, it served to identify the houses''
    occupants as probably being Israelites. Third, treating God''s commandment
    metaphorically and failing to physically apply the blood to the doorposts
    would not have been sufficient and would have resulted in death of the
    firstborn for that house. As I have already said, in Orthodox Jewish communities all men wear tzitziyot , and there is discussion about whether they are also
    appropriate for women; Orthodox women normally do not wear them. In
    communities that have not adopted policies regarding tzitziyot , each
    individual must make his own decision about whether to wear them as described
    in Scripture, or substitute some other article of clothing or accessory that
    will accomplish the same thing - reminding anyone seeing it of the
    commandments of God. What fringes are is self-evident, so our decisions (other than whether to
    wear them at all) are what to make them of, whether and how to knot them,
    what the color and origin of the dye for the blue thread should be, and to
    what articles of clothing they should be attached. Since the only
    requirement in Scripture is that they be placed on the corners of garments,
    unless one''s community defines the particulars of acceptable tzitziyot , the wearer can use his own judgment on all of these. The
    orthodox Jewish community has adopted detailed rules for the construction of tzitziyot , which their male members attach to a special four-cornered
    garment called a tallit katan , and wear under their shirts or vests. Tzitziyot are also worn on the traditional rectangular prayer shawl,
    the tallit gadol . Both the tallit katan and the tallit
    gadol are often intentionally lacking the prescribed blue
    thread. 1 It is important to not to get so involved in the details of how to make tzitziyot , that we forget what they are supposed to remind us of,
    which are the commandments of God. We are not only to be reminded, but to be
    made continually aware of God''s commandments as we proceed through each day. I believe that the commandment to wear tzitziyot is applicable for
    both Jewish men and Jewish women, notwithstanding the prevailing modern
    practice of their only being worn by men. The principle of wearing tzitziyot is also applicable to Gentiles, but there is greater liberty
    for them and, in fact, it may be preferable that Gentiles (other than K''rovei Yisrael ) not wear fringes because the wearing of fringes today
    has become almost completely associated with being a Jew. If there is a
    concern, some kind of substitution to accomplish the same purpose is easily
    adaptable. It is interesting to note that not all references to tefillin are for
    the purpose of remembering God''s Word broadly. Exodus 13:9 connects
    the tefillin to remembering how God brought the Jewish people out of
    Egypt. 1. The practice among some to not include the blue thread
    has its origin in the scarcity of the chilazon - a sea creature from
    which the blue dye was originally extracted.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The following incorporates excerpts from Tikkun
    International''s 1 halachic 2 paper " The Status of Gentiles in Messianic
    Judaism :" 3 The word "conversion" has a particularly onerous meaning in the history of
    Judaism because of its association with persecutions of the Jewish people,
    and attempts to force Jews to "convert" to Christianity by abandoning their
    Jewish identity and assimilating into the Christian Church. That
    notwithstanding, the American Jewish community also uses the term to describe
    the process of receiving Gentiles into the Jewish people by making them
    Jewish "converts" (proselytes) and, as generally understood, fully Jews. The
    modern Church and Synagogue have, generally speaking, come to use the term
    "conversion" as a process by which the "converted" person becomes one of
    their own flock, rather than as a process whereby one''s heart is "converted"
    from unbelief to one of repentance and faith. This is evident when some
    Christian denominations do not recognize the baptisms of other Christian
    denominations, and when groups or denominations within Judaism decline to
    recognize conversions conducted by other (usually less observant) sectors of
    the Jewish community. The word "proselyte", derived from (proselytos),
    is used in the Septuagint (LXX) to refer to Gentile "strangers" or
    "sojourners" in the land of Israel. Gentiles that worshipped the God of
    Abraham appear very early in the Bible and, by the time of Moses, two
    categories of "strangers" were recognized. They were those that were
    subordinate to the Israelites, and those that took on full citizenry that
    included membership in tribes, and even inheritance of land (see Exodus
    12:48-49 and Ezekiel 47:21-23 ). The practice of receiving
    Gentiles into Israel continued throughout the centuries and today, the terms
    "Jewish proselyte" and "Jewish convert" are synonymous, and refer to former
    Gentiles who have irreversibly taken on covenantal Jewish identity that is
    subsequently conveyed to their children (through inheritance) dor
    l''dor . From the time of their "conversions", these proselytes or
    converts are considered, by the Jewish community, to be Jews in every way. It was inevitable that the matter of "conversion" would make its way into
    Messianic Judaism. It has always been an issue among us because of desire for
    unity in mixed marriages, because there are Gentiles within our congregations
    who perceive that they are called to become Jewish for various reasons (some
    good and some not so good), and because some Messianic Jewish congregations
    limit certain aspects of synagogue life to Jews. In tension with it, the
    biblical legitimacy of conversion has been questioned, principally because of
    the admonitions of the Apostle Paul to Gentiles in 1 Corinthians
    7:17-20 and Galatians 5:1-6, 11-13 that they should not be
    circumcised, and because of the instruction to Gentiles in Acts 15 that they are exempt from the requirement of full Torah observance for
    salvation. It is Tikkun''s opinion (and the opinion of the authors herein), that the
    conversion of Gentiles to becoming Jewish proselytes should be discouraged in
    most cases, but that there are exceptions (illustrated by Ruth 1:16-17 and Esther 8:17b ) where it should be allowed. Related to this, it has
    been noticed there are two categories of Gentiles that populate Messianic
    Jewish congregations today, analogous to two categories that existed within
    Israel during the time of Moses. Back then there were those that were
    genuinely and permanently joined to the nation and the God of Israel (similar
    to the Gentiles that accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt), and there were
    those that lived in proximity to the camp of Israel and did business with the
    Israelites, but remained unaffiliated with the community. Today it is
    different of course, due to the New Covenant. Today, all Gentiles who
    receive Yeshua as Lord and Messiah are supernaturally grafted into the
    " Romans 11 olive tree," and become equal citizens along with all
    Jewish believers in Yeshua, in what is termed the "commonwealth of Israel"
    ( Ephesians 2:12 , NKJ). The Gentiles that are part of this
    "Commonwealth" of faith comprise the larger circle of Gentile believers. They
    are joined to the Jewish people by genuine affiliation, but there is an inner
    circle as well. Most Gentile citizens of the Commonwealth, while recognizing their grafted-in
    relationship with the Jewish people, do not consider themselves to be (nor do
    they want to be) part of the Jewish community per se; these are the believers
    that we call "Christians". There are, however, some Gentile citizens of the
    commonwealth who are called by God to have a special and permanent connection
    to the Jewish community - to live among Jews (Messianic Jews preferably), to
    maintain a Torah -observant New Covenant lifestyle, to marry Messianic
    Jewish believers or Gentiles similarly called, to raise their children in
    Messianic Jewish life, and to participate in Messianic Jewish covenantal
    responsibilities along with their Jewish comrades. Tikkun designates
    Gentiles who are so called to be known as K''rovei Yisrael (singular K''rov Yisrael ), - "those who are closely related to
    Israel." 4 We use this term to recognize Gentiles who are a genuine part of the Jewish
    community, but who have not converted to become Jews. Because a Jew and Gentile who marry produce Jewish children, for the sake of
    Jewish continuity we discourage Messianic Jews from marrying those who would
    raise their family outside of the Messianic Jewish community even if both are
    believers in Yeshua. Mixed marriages of Messianic Jews and K''rovei
    Yisrael are non-problematic, however, because they both have lifelong
    callings to the Jewish people, and are therefore certain to bring their
    children up to understand and embrace their Jewish identities and Jewish
    covenant obligations. As for two K''rovei Yisrael who marry: They will
    no doubt influence their children to be K''rovei Yisrael as well, but
    they cannot guarantee it because K''rov Yisrael Gentiles cannot convey
    their identities generationally as do Jews. Children of K''rov Yisrael parents have a choice, and may believe that they are not called primarily to
    live among Jewish people or to take on a Messianic Jewish communal way of
    life. While we recognize the biblical legitimacy of Jewish conversion, we do not
    encourage K''rov Yisrael Gentiles to convert because Gentile identity
    ( K''rov Yisrael identity included) is as important in serving God as is
    Jewish identity. That notwithstanding, we consider conversion an acceptable
    option for those K''rovei Yisrael Messianic Gentiles who are either
    married to Jews, betrothed or engaged to Jews, legally adopted by Jews, or
    who have a Jewish parent or grandparent and wish to acquire, re-acquire, or
    affirm, Jewish identity. We discourage conversions under non-Messianic Jewish (i.e. rabbinical)
    auspices, but are of the opinion that we should receive persons as Jews who
    are converted by any appropriate and reputable Jewish authority. The
    procedure of conversion consists essentially of two parts: (1) making a
    covenant declaration or oath before witnesses (similar to Ruth''s declaration
    to Naomi), and (2) acceptance of the covenant declaration by one or more bona
    fide representatives of the Jewish community (Ruth was received, and her
    marriage to Boaz was endorsed by the elders of their Jewish community). For
    men, conversion also requires brit milah (covenant circumcision), and
    we recommend tevilah (ritual immersion) in keeping with the custom of
    our people. 1. Tikkun International (a.k.a. "Tikkun") is
    a Messianic Jewish apostolic network and covenant community of fivefold
    ministry leaders and congregations. 2. Tikkun''s understanding of New Covenant Halacha is apostolic guidance and, as such, is not binding in the
    same way as it is understood in historical Judaism. This is principally
    because New Covenant believers rely on the Ruach HaKodesh to direct
    them individually. 3. "The Status of Gentiles in Messianic Judaism:" Tikkun International , June 12, 2009. 4. See A Place in the Tent; Intermarriage and

  commentary_rudolph: 'Different corrective considerations apply according to whether a brother''s
    sin is against another brother (private offense) or against the community
    broadly (public offense). Also, that which applies to a brother does not
    necessarily apply to unbelieving neighbors because unbelievers have not
    committed themselves to the principles and disciplines of Scripture ( 1
    Corinthians 5:12-13 ). A. RESPONDING TO THE PRIVATE OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER A. RESPONDING TO THE PRIVATE OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER OVERLOOKING A SIN Even when we are authorized to seek redress for a sin committed against us,
    we need not do so, for Proverbs 19:11 states: People with good sense are slow to anger, and it is their glory to
    overlook an offense. And Ecclesiastes 7:21-22 states: Also, don''t take seriously every word spoken, such as when you hear your
    servant speaking badly of you; because often, as you yourself know, you have
    spoken badly of others. This is in keeping with God''s desire that we take upon ourselves His holy
    nature, for He Himself has been known to overlook sin ( Acts
    17:29-30 ). 1 Some private offenses are easily overlooked - especially those that are
    unintentional, have done no great harm, and are unlikely to be repeated.
    Although it may seem that overlooking an offense is always the loving thing
    to do, it is not necessarily so. One''s decision should always be based upon
    what is best for the offender, and what is best for others against whom the
    offender may sin in the future if he is not made accountable. If the offense
    is overlooked, it should not be brought up again unless the offense is
    repeated. Also, overlooking a sin does not assure that the parties will
    remain in, or return to, reconciliation. 1. Consider also, how Moses pleaded with God to
    overlook the sins of Israel ( Deuteronomy 9:27 ). GOING TO OUR OFFENDING BROTHER Much is said about rebuking and correcting in both the Tanach and the
    New Covenant Scriptures. Leviticus 19:17-18 is generally cited by the
    classical Jewish commentators as the Scripture that commands this, but there
    are many others that apply as well, as one can see from the large number of
    Scriptures cited in this Mitzvah . Another key Scripture from the Tanach is Proverbs 27:5 : Better open rebuke than hidden love. (See also, Proverbs 9:8-9 ) If our decision is to not overlook an offense, we must confront the offending
    brother with his sin: Matthew 18:15 : Moreover, if your brother commits a sin against you, go and show him his
    fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you,
    you have won back your brother. Galatians 6:1-2 : Brothers, suppose someone is caught doing something wrong. You who have
    the Spirit should set him right, but in a spirit of humility, keeping an eye
    on yourselves so that you won''t be tempted too. Bear one another''s burdens -
    in this way you will be fulfilling the Torah''s true meaning, which the
    Messiah upholds. There are three things in the foregoing Scriptures that stand out. First, we
    are to go to our brother alone. That means we are not to share our complaint
    with others before first giving our brother the opportunity to repent and
    make things right. This principle assumes two things: (1) The parties are
    relatively equal in their ability to deal with one another, and (2) There is
    no impropriety in the parties meeting privately. An example of inequality
    would be a child having to confront an adult; an example of improper privacy
    would be a male and female meeting alone to confront one another concerning
    sexual sin. In these and similar cases, the Scriptures should be interpreted
    broadly enough to permit chaperoning and for allowing the weaker of the two
    adversaries to be accompanied by a suitable protector. Second, when we go to our brother to tell him his fault, our attitude must be
    pure, and our demeanor proper. The operative expression in the Galatians Scripture is " a spirit of humility ", and our motive
    for going must be to reconcile and not to extract a confession of fault. Third, our purpose for confronting our brother must be to restore him to
    righteousness, and our hope must be for reconciliation. Although in cases
    involving damage or loss we may seek restitution as part of the
    reconciliation process, we are not to sue our brother in a secular court
    ( 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 ). RETURNING WITH WITNESSES If the offending brother agrees with our complaint and repents, the matter
    is, of course, concluded, and we forgive him. If he does not agree or refuses
    to meet privately, we must then elect whether to pursue the matter further,
    or to belatedly overlook his sin ( Proverbs 19:11 ). Although
    overlooking the sin at this juncture is possible, its appropriateness has to
    be questioned. If there remains un-reconciliation, we should go to our
    brother again and, this time, bring one or two witnesses: Matthew 18:16 : If he doesn''t listen, take one or two others with you so that every
    accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses. These need not be witnesses to the original offense complained of (although
    they may be), but rather to our second meeting with our brother. 2 Our usual concept of witnesses is that they are silent observers. In this
    case, however, Matthew 18:17 , authorizes the witnesses to determine
    which of the parties to the dispute is wrong, and to urge that person to
    listen to reason and repent: Matthew 18:17a : If he refuses to hear them ... As before, if the parties come to agreement or the offending brother repents,
    the matter is concluded. If however, the attempt at reconciliation is
    unsuccessful, the matter must be brought to the ekklesia (assembly)
    for adjudication (see Matthew 18:17c below). 2. Although not addressed in Scripture, fairness probably allows the
    offending brother to invite his own witnesses to the meeting as well. BRINGING THE DISPUTE TO A BET DIN OF ELDERS Matthew 18:17b : ... tell the congregation The word "congregation" in the CJB translation ("church" in some
    translations) is ( ekklesia ) in the
    Greek text, which means "a gathering", "an assembly" (for worship), or "a
    deliberative council". According to Matthew 18:17b , if the
    complainant and the witnesses are unsuccessful in convincing the offender to
    repent, the matter is to be brought to the ekklesia for adjudication.
    Since the entire ekklesia (the body of believers) is too large a group
    to assemble for hearing and judging cases, it is the prevailing view that a
    court ( bet din ) of assembled elders (reminiscent of Deuteronomy
    17:8-13 ) acts on behalf of the ekklesia . JUDGMENT OF THE ELDERS After the elders of a bet din render their judgment, the party ruled
    against is required to repent and comply with any orders issued, including
    orders of restitution. If he refuses to do so, he commits a new offense -
    that of disobeying the lawful orders of the tribunal. This new offense is
    public in nature because the disobedience is against the public
    authority. 3 When this occurs, the judging elders are required to inform
    the body of believers of the respondent''s disobedience, and order that he
    henceforth be treated as one who is no longer a believer: Matthew 18:17c : ... and if he refuses to listen even to the congregation, treat him as
    you would a pagan or a tax-collector. This is sometimes referred to as a decree of "disfellowship" or
    "excommunication". It is a common misunderstanding that when a brother is excommunicated
    pursuant to Matthew 18 , he must necessarily be ejected from the
    congregation. On the contrary, after a judgment of excommunication, unless
    he is also disruptive, the "former" brother should be treated as an
    unbeliever in every way and we do not eject unbelievers. Instead, unless he
    is also a violator of 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 (walking in immorality
    while calling himself a believer) or Titus 3:10-11 (being divisive or
    otherwise harmful to the body), he should be encouraged to attend
    congregational services and other events where he is likely to hear the Word
    of God and be encouraged to repent. One important consequence of a Matthew 18 excommunication is that the complainant is released from
    the constraint of 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 and is free to sue the
    unrepentant respondent in a public court. Another common misunderstanding is that a decree of excommunication applies
    only to the excommunicating congregation or denomination. Biblically, that
    is not so. Judgments arising from Matthew 18 proceedings apply across
    the entire body of believers and, so long as correct biblical doctrine is
    applied and due process is afforded, all Yeshua-believing congregations
    should recognize and comply with judgments rendered by reputable batei
    din . What is especially ominous, is that God Himself recognizes batei din judgments ( Matthew 18:18-20 ). Unfortunately, the current state of the body of believers is such that a
    valid excommunication by one congregation''s or church''s ecclesiastic court is
    often ignored by other congregations, the result of which is that
    excommunicated persons are often received into a believing community without
    being required to repent. The body of believer needs to correct this. It is important to appreciate that a brother who is accused of sin cannot be
    forced to attend or to cooperate with any of the Matthew 18 meetings.
    However, if he refuses to meet or to attend, he does so at his peril, because
    his refusal elevates the controversy to its next level without anyone being
    able to hear his defense or point of view. If he refuses to attend or
    cooperate at the last ( bet din ) stage, evidence against him will
    likely be presented in his absence, with predictable results. 3. See section below: "Responding to a Public
    Offense." RESTORING A BROTHER TO FELLOWSHIP A judgment of "disfellowship" is reversible in the same way as the status of
    being an unbeliever is reversible. What is required is that the sanctioned
    brother repent of his former sin, comply with all orders of the convicting bet din , and receive Yeshua again as his Lord and Savior. Ideally, the
    same bet din that ruled previously is convened to judge the repentance
    and, if it is deemed genuine, the tribunal sets aside its prior judgment and
    publishes a decree of restoration. This restoration, which is declared on
    earth, is also recognized in heaven: Matthew 18:18-20: Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth will be
    prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in
    heaven. To repeat, I tell you that if two of you here on earth agree about
    anything people ask, it will be for them from my Father in heaven. For
    wherever two or three are assembled in my name, I am there with them. THE "JUDGE-ME-NOT" DEFENSE Believers who seek to avoid correction often quote Matthew 7:1 : Don''t judge, so that you won''t be judged. The full context of this Scripture is, however, rarely quoted; it continues
    with verses 2-5 : For the way you judge others is how you will be judged - the measure with
    which you measure out will be used to measure to you. Why do you see the
    splinter in your brother''s eye but not notice the log in your own eye? How
    can you say to your brother, ''Let me take the splinter out of your eye,'' when
    you have the log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First, take the log out of
    your own eye; then you will see clearly, so that you can remove the splinter
    from your brother''s eye! So, the Scripture does not prohibit judging one''s brother; it merely exhorts
    us to repent of our own sins first. There is, in addition, another
    Scripture, 1 Corinthians 5:12 , that specifically authorizes brothers
    to judge each other; it reads: For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Isn''t it those who are
    part of the community that you should be judging? WHEN THE OFFENDER IS US! Matthew 5:23-24 : So if you are offering your gift at the Temple altar and you remember
    there that your brother has something against you, leave your gift where it
    is by the altar, and go, make peace with your brother. Then come back and
    offer your gift. If we know or suspect that we have sinned against a brother, we are not to
    wait until the brother comes to us - we are to go to him. Noted author Jay
    Adams has been known to say that ideally, the offender and the offended
    should meet in the street between their respective homes, each on his way to
    seek reconciliation with the other. B. RESPONDING TO A PUBLIC OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER B. RESPONDING TO A PUBLIC OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER A public offense is a sin committed by an individual against the community
    broadly, i.e., against the local congregation, or believers at large. This
    kind of offense is the biblical analogy of a criminal offense in secular law.
    Public offenses pose a danger to the community, so the primary responsibility
    of the community''s leaders is to protect the flock by ministering correction
    to the offender. The goal here is different than in the case of private
    offenses, where promoting reconcilÂ­iation through the Matthew 18 process is the primary purpose. The following verses of Scripture reveal how
    the shaliach Paul dealt with one such public offense: 1 Corinthians 5:1-2 : It is actually being reported that there is sexual sin among you, and it
    is sexual sin of a kind that is condemned even by pagans - a man is living
    with his stepmother! And you stay proud? Shouldn''t you rather have felt some
    sadness that would have led you to remove from your company the man who has
    done this thing? 1 Corinthians 5:5 : ... hand over such a person to the Adversary for his old nature to be
    destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord. PROSECUTING PUBLIC OFFENSES An important difference between public and private offenses is that, in the
    case of public offenses, it is the community''s guardians - its elders - who
    are responsible for protecting the community by correcting wrongs, and
    administering justice ( Hebrews 13:17 ). That notwithstanding, an
    individual congregant is often the first person to become aware that a public
    offense has or may have been committed. Although, according to Galatians
    6:1-2 he may confront the perpetrator for the purpose of ministering
    correction and urging his brother to repent, he is not authorized to act for
    the community in either judging the matter or deciding what remedial action
    should be taken. Therefore, in all but trivial cases, the
    congregant-citizen''s duty is to report the suspected offense, or the evidence
    thereof, to the community''s elders 4 . 5 In my opinion, the procedure of choice for prosecuting public offenses
    should, where possible, be a modification of the Matthew 18 process
    previously discussed. In the case of public offenses, however, the
    complainant is not an individual; rather, it is the community, so the ones to
    confront are one or more elders representing the community, analogous to Matthew 18:15 . If the initial confrontation does not produce an
    adequate result, the next step is to meet again, this time taking one or two
    additional witnesses (who should also be elders, analogous to Matthew
    18:16 ). If, after this meeting, the elder delegation believes that the
    accused has committed sin and the matter is not resolved, then, just as in
    the case of a private offense, a formal bet din of the ekklesia is convened. This conclave consists of the elders who were the witnesses,
    preferably joined by other elders, analogous to Matthew 18:17 . Then,
    after hearing, if the bet din rules against the accused, it is to take
    whatever measures it deems appropriate for enabling justice and protecting
    the community. It is also my opinion, when an individual has reason to believe that a
    brother in the faith has committed a significant trespass against the
    criminal law of society, a prudent and covenantal first step is to consult
    elders of the body for their wisdom in how to proceed. Nevertheless, the
    individual may inform the secular governing authorities directly but, if he
    does, his reason for doing so should be that it is required for public
    safety, and to comply with Romans 13:1-2 . 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 does not apply in this case, because that Scripture only prohibits brothers
    suing brothers for redress of private grievances; this would not be a
    private grievance. 4. A gentle covenantal approach
    to doing this is to urge the offender to go to the elders himself and
    confess his transgression. If he is unwilling to do so, he should be
    invited to be present when the informant discloses to the
    elders. 5. According to Deuteronomy 19:15 , one may not
    bring an accusation, except by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
    This does not preclude one from informing the elders that an offense may
    have been committed; it does, however, define the level of proof needed for
    verdict of "guilty". PUNISHING FOR PUBLIC OFFENSES The only proper response for having committed a public offense is to repent
    and obey all remedial orders issued by a properly constituted bet din .
    Although there are a myriad of possible public offenses, there are two
    categories of them which, if not repented of, result in separation from the
    body of believers; the two categories are: (a) sins that can lead to excommunication (b) sins that can lead to being removed from fellowship. The first of these categories (a) has already been discussed: It is refusing
    to repent for a sin after being ordered to do so by a bet din in the
    aftermath of a judicial proceeding. As previously explained, excommunication
    is a judgment by a court of elders that a person, once considered to be a
    brother in the faith, is no longer so. It is important to mention here that
    excommunication does not result from the underlying sin itself, but from the
    disobedience of refusing to repent after being ordered to do so. The second of these categories (b) consists of five behaviors for which a
    person must be banned from fellowship with believers: A believer, who is walking in unrepentant immorality ( 1 Corinthians
    5:9-13 ). A believer, who is in gross doctrinal error, and not in accord with
    the Scripture and with Apostolic doctrine ( 2 John 1:9-11 , Galatians 1:8-9 ). A believer who is disorderly in his lifestyle ( 2 Thessalonians
    3:6-15 ): A believer who is divisive and has been warned twice ( Titus
    3:10-11 ; Romans 16:17 ). An unbeliever who is rebellious and scoffs at the Word of God
    ( Proverbs 22:10 ). In the first three cases, the danger to the body comes from the offender
    holding himself out, or being considered to be, part of the community - a
    believer, yet being in significant sin, professing heretical doctrines, or
    walking in a disorderly manner. While these traits are understandable in
    unbelievers, a believer (or professing believer) with such characteristics
    brings discredit to the body. Such behaviors can also present a stumbling
    block for new members of a believing community who are not yet fully
    discipled, and whose discernment is not yet fully developed. The fourth and fifth cases on the list apply to persons who sow discord,
    whether or not they are believers, and it makes no difference that the
    rebelliousness or divisiveness is unconscious or unintended. They are both
    dangerous and contagious in a community of believers, and those who practice
    them and do not stop must be excluded. In the first four cases, repentance restores the offending brother to
    fellowship, and in the fifth case, the unbeliever to again being welcome.
    Restoration is not automatic, however, for whether or not an offender''s
    repentance is genuine is a matter to be judged by the same bet din that judged and disciplined him originally. ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ELDERS Some contend that Scripture establishes a more stringent standard for
    bringing an accusation against an elder and, for their authority, they refer
    to 1 Timothy 5:19-20 : Never listen to any accusation against a leader unless it is supported by
    two or three witnesses. Rebuke before the whole assembly those leaders who
    continue sinning, as a warning to the others. Actually, the foregoing Scripture establishes the same standard for bringing
    an accusation against an elder as does Deuteronomy 19:15 for bringing
    an accusation against anyone else. A plausible explanation for why there
    exists a special Scripture for elders, is that the verses which precede 1
    Timothy 5:19 speak of the awesome responsibility which leaders have to
    their flock. The flock is therefore exhorted to obey their leaders so as to
    assist them in performing their functions with joy. Because leaders are
    highly visible and their actions sometimes controversial, they are especially
    vulnerable to accusations and criticisms in the form of whispers or gossip.
    These are damaging to an elder''s reputation and ability to lead, and so the
    above verses of Scripture are a reminder to us that we must apply to our
    elders the same high standard that we apply when we bring public accusations
    against others. C. REBUKING AND CORRECTING A BROTHER EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO OFFENSE
    COMMITTED AGAINST US C. REBUKING AND CORRECTING A BROTHER EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO OFFENSE
    COMMITTED AGAINST US Leviticus 19:17 : Do not hate your brother in your heart, but rebuke your neighbor
    frankly, so that you won''t carry sin because of him. This Scripture infers that we have a responsibility to rebuke and correct our
    neighbor brother who is in sin, even when the sin is not directed against us.
    It could be for our brother''s sake alone, and the Scripture is clear that, if
    we do not rebuke and correcthim, we will be in sin as well (see also, Galatians 6:1-2 ; James 5:16b ). D. BRINGING CORRECTION TO PERSONS OUTSIDE OF THE BELIEVING COMMUNITY D. BRINGING CORRECTION TO PERSONS OUTSIDE OF THE BELIEVING COMMUNITY In disputes with non-brethren, the believer is required to act biblically,
    while no such constraint can be expected from, or enforced upon, his
    opponent. Some may see this as a disadvantage for the believer, but it is
    actually a strength, because God''s peace and wisdom result from submitting
    one''s self to the Word of God. To begin with, the believer is not to
    exacerbate conflict by his own improper conduct. Rather, he is to live in
    peace with all persons as much as it is possible ( Romans 12:18 Proverbs 16:7 ) and, once conflict has arisen, he is not to respond in
    the flesh, but out of love ( Romans 12:19-21 ). As with conflicts between brethren, the exercise of personal forgiveness is
    mandatory: Mark 11:25 : And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive
    him; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses. Also, there are occasions when an offense may or should be overlooked, as
    stated in Proverbs 19:11 . If the offense is not overlooked, employing
    the first step in the Matthew 18 process (going to him privately)
    should be considered, even though it is not required in disputes with
    unbelievers, because Scripture teaches the advisability of settling disputes
    quickly ( Matthew 5:25 ). If going to your opponent does not solve the
    problem, suing in the public courts may be an option. Matthew 5:37-41 is often misunderstood as commanding believers to be
    pacifistic toward those who would hurt them, enslave them, or take their
    property. To understand this better, let us focus on verse 39a : But I tell you not to stand up against someone who does you wrong. The word "resist" in the Greek, " anth-is''-tay-mee " can refer to
    passive resistance, but one of its recognized meanings is "to set one''s self
    against" (Strong''s Greek Lexicon, word 436) - a decidedly aggressive posture.
    Which approach to employ when anthistaymee is used, can be deduced
    from the next sentence: On the contrary, if someone hits you on the right cheek, let him hit you
    on the left cheek too! According to Craig S. Keener, 6 " The blow on the
    right cheek was the most grievous insult possible in the ancient world
    ... " (e.g. 1 Kings 22:24 ). What the Scripture is actually saying
    (Keener opines), is that we should not retaliate against an evil person. For
    example, if the person tries to provoke us by insulting us, rather than
    meeting his challenge with aggression of our own, we should accept the insult
    and even a second insult (present our other cheek). This does not mean that
    we should not protect ourselves from harm either physically or through legal
    means when appropriate. The next statement in the Scripture, Matthew 5:40 , says: If someone wants to sue you for your shirt, let him have your coat as
    well. I agree with Keener that this is meant as hyperbole, and is addressing our
    attitude regarding ownership. It teaches that where someone is suing us
    unjustly, we should prefer to bear the injustice, and even give him more than
    he wants, rather than become a defendant in a law suit. The statement
    " And if a soldier forces you to carry his pack for one mile, carry it for
    two! " is also a teaching about our attitude regarding ownership - in this
    case, however, ownership of time and freedom. It is a reference to the
    ancient Roman soldier''s right to impress a person into serving him (e.g. Mark 15:21 ). The Scripture teaches that we should prefer to bear the
    injustice of servitude, and even give more than required as ones who, in
    obedience to God, are called to love our enemies. 6. The IVP Bible Background

  commentary_rudolph: 'The essence of this Mitzvah is that we must not oppress an employee by
    withholding or delaying payment of his wages. There are many kinds of
    employees today in many occupations. Some are day laborers and some are poor
    and some are not. It is customary to pay a hired man or employee at the end
    of a specified period of time that may be daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly,
    or at the conclusion of a contract, so this Mitzvah should not be
    interpreted to require that all workers be paid daily. That having been
    said, Deuteronomy 24:14-15 requires that an employer pay a hired man
    daily if the man''s impoverished condition makes it reasonable and
    compassionate to do so. The inference of Deuteronomy 14 is that not paying wages to a poor
    worker in a timely manner is akin to exploiting him, and there are
    undoubtedly unscrupulous employers who would withhold or delay the payment of
    wages to a poor worker in order to pressure the worker into giving the
    employer some kind of advantage. This Mitzvah can, therefore, be
    construed to have a broader meaning, which is to not exploit an employee''s
    weakness to gain advantage.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The four species are (1) choice fruit, (2) palm branches, (3) thick branches,
    and (4) willows of the brook. Traditionally, parts of each are bound
    together into a bouquet (sometimes referred to as a lulav , but
    literally, lulav only refers to a palm branch) and are preserved and
    waived for each of the seven days of Sukkot . The command to take up
    the four species clearly applies to the first day but, since the Scripture
    states that we are to celebrate for seven days, we suppose that waving them
    as part of the celebration is contemplated. Scripture does not specify a
    particular select fruit, so the tradition developed to use an etrog (citron)
    that has part of its fragile stem still attached. Halachically ,
    therefore, the etrog becomes unusable if the short nub of a stem becomes
    detached. We do not know whether, during the time of Yeshua, binding the four species
    together and waving all four was practiced at celebrations other than Sukkot . The practice was probably specific to Sukkot because
    we read in John 12:12 (speaking of before Passover) that Yeshua was
    met with the waving of palm branches only. The question remains, however,
    "What is the significance of waving the four species at Sukkot ?"
    Scripture is silent on this, but its significance was probably agricultural
    since Sukkot is a harvest celebration. The Talmud seeks to
    answer this by suggesting that the four species represent God''s creation, and
    that waving them in all directions signifies that HaShem is Lord of
    all. It is significant that an expression of worship meant for God (waving palms)
    was used to recognize and welcome Yeshua, and it is also significant that John 12:15 states: Daughter of Tziyon, don''t be afraid! Look! your King is coming, sitting on
    a donkey''s colt. What it means to "take up" the four species is open to interpretation, but
    this Mitzvah is unquestionably applicable to Jews and, in my opinion,
    to K''rov Yisrael Gentiles as well. Because we don''t know exactly what
    "taking up" means, the procedure should be done according to the established
    practice or halachah of each community in which the worshiper finds
    himself. I do not believe that taking up the four species is required of
    other Gentiles as part of their worship of God during Sukkot, but they may do
    so if they deem it to be meaningful.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Leviticus 21:7 commands that a Levitical cohen is not to marry
    a zonah (a harlot), a chalalah (a woman who has been
    profaned) 1 , or a g''rushah (divorcee). Its clear application was for when the Jerusalem
    Temple was fully functioning, in order to dissuade cohanim from
    marrying women who would compromise their ritual purity and disqualify them
    from Temple service. This has application even today, by those who look
    toward a future restored Temple ( Ezekiel 40-47 ) that is accompanied by
    a restored Levitical priesthood (e.g. Orthodox Judaism applies the Scripture
    literally and without exception to men they believe to be cohanim ). 2 Conservative Judaism has ruled differently. Regarding the marriage of a cohen to a divorcee, in 1954, the "Committee on Jewish Law and
    Standards" (CJLS) of the Conservative Jewish Movement adopted a 1952
    responsum written by R. Ben Zion Bokser authorizing Rabbinical Assembly
    rabbis to join cohanim and divorcees in marriage without interfering
    with the cohen''s status. 3 This was incorporated in R. Arnold M. Goodman''s paper titled " Solemnizing
    the Marriage between a Cohen and Divorcee ", which was adopted by
    the CJLS in 1996, and which contains the following paragraph: We also regard divorce differently than did our Biblical and Rabbinic
    forbearers. We no longer perceive the divorced woman as being guilty of [an
    unsavory act]. To exclude a Jewish woman who is divorced from marrying the
    man with whom she is in love, affirms the negative status of the divorcee.
    This is inconsistent with our view of divorce or of our assessment of the
    character of a woman who happens to be g''rushah [divorced]. Messianic Judaism''s view of a priest marrying a divorcee is similar but more
    complex, because we (unlike other branches of Judaism) contend that the New
    Covenant has replaced (or is in the process of replacing) the Covenant that
    created and gave function to the Levitical priesthood in the first place
    ( Hebrews 8:13 ). It is also more complex for us because we profess the
    existence of a New Covenant priesthood that consists of all believers in
    Messiah Yeshua, both men and women. Most Messianic Jewish scholars and leaders interpret Ezekiel 40-47 as
    applying to a Temple that will someday be rebuilt and, in which, certain
    sacrifices will resume. We do not believe that the sin-related sacrifices
    will resume (since Yeshua has become our sacrifice ( Hebrews 9:11-14 ; 10:1-14 )), nor that the presiding priests in the rebuilt Temple will
    necessarily be Levitical. Nevertheless, we tend to follow the Conservative
    Jewish Movement''s point of view, and their practice of allowing both men and
    women descendants of Aaron to marry divorced persons ( g''rushot )
    without any penalty to their perceived priestly status. We make an exception,
    however, in the case of a divorce that was biblically unauthorized, and the
    divorcee, while claiming to be a believer in Yeshua, either caused it or
    procured it. In that case, remarriage by the divorcee might be prohibited
    regardless of the intended spouse''s identity. Such matters should be decided
    by a bet din of elders. Regarding the other biblical prohibitions of Leviticus 21:7 - a cohen marrying a zonah and a cohen marrying a chalalah - the Scripture is speaking to the Levitical cohanim of the Mosaic Covenant, but it has application in the New Covenant as well.
    In Temple times, marrying a zonah or chalalah would have
    adversely affected a cohen ''s ritual purity, and would have
    disqualified him from serving in the Temple. The New Covenant extension of
    this is that no priests - neither men nor women - neither Jews nor Gentiles -
    neither those who are priests by virtue of their faith in Yeshua nor those
    who are priests by virtue of their Levitical inheritance - no priests of God
    (which means none of us) are to be yoked in marriage to persons who are
    likely to compromise our holiness and therefore our effectiveness in serving
    God. Every covenant we are in yokes us to our covenant partners for better or
    worse, and the covenant of marriage is no exception. Both through our own
    marriages and through observing the marriages of others, we are keenly aware

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah bestows the term "Annual Sabbath" on seven of the
    annually-occurring "designated times" listed in Leviticus 23 . This is
    because, as in the case of the weekly Sabbath, we are commanded to rest on
    them, refrain from work, and assemble. Of these however, only one of them - Yom Kippur - is actually termed a Sabbath in the Scriptures. Each of
    these days has its unique theme and reason for being, but because they bear
    a basic similarity to the weekly Sabbath, the related issues of work, rest,
    and application to Gentiles will be dealt with here only briefly. The first and seventh days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread remind us of
    God''s provision and our need to purge leaven (analogized to sin) from
    our lives ( 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 ). Of all the feasts, Passover is the
    one that has most caught the attention of the Christian Church. This is
    because of the obvious analogy of the Passover lamb sacrifice to Yeshua''s
    sacrifice, where the blood of each of the sacrifices, saved those who
    applied it. The next "designated time" listed on the biblical calendar, Shavuot ,
    was historically commanded to the Israelites to commemorate the Spring
    harvest, but it is relevant to Gentile followers of Yeshua as well, both as
    an identification with the Jewish People, and also as a memorial of the Shavuot that occurred centuries later, when God made the Holy Spirit
    available on earth to all of mankind ( Acts 2:1-21, 10:45 ). Christian
    terminology for this day is
    "Pentecost" 1 . Shavuot is unique among the Annual Sabbaths in being the only one that
    Scripture does not assign a particular date on the lunar calendar. Instead, Leviticus 23:10,15-16 states: Tell the people of Israel, ''After you enter the land I am giving you and
    harvest its ripe crops, you are to bring a sheaf od firstfruits of your
    harvest to the cohen ... From the day after the day of rest - that is, from
    the day you bring the sheaf for waving - you are to count seven full weeks,
    until the day after the seventh week; you are to count fifty days; and then
    you are to present a new grain offering to ADONAI.'' This fifty-day count from "the day after the day of rest" (or Sabbath) is
    known in Jewish practice as "counting the omer ", and which one of
    several possible Sabbaths is "day zero" of the count is a subject of ongoing
    dispute that involves two different days that Scripture refers to as
    "firstfruits". The first of these is the one in Leviticus 23:10 which,
    for clarity, I will refer to as Yom
    Habbikurim . 2 The second occurance is in Numbers 28:26 , where the term is again
    used, but for Shavuot . Yom T''ruah (day of blowing) is also known as the "Day of Trumpets" or
    " Shofarot ", and as " Rosh Hashanah " (head of the year, i.e. New
    Year) by the Rabbinic community. It is followed ten days later by Yom
    Kippur (Day of Atonement). Although these days were historically
    commanded to the Israelites, Gentile followers of Yeshua may choose to
    observe them as well, both to identify with the Jewish People, and also to
    use as times of personal introspection and repentance that may lead to
    joining with their Jewish brothers in praying for Israel on Yom
    Kippur . This is especially appropriate when one considers the elevated
    position of New Covenant believers (both Jews and non-Jews) as priests under
    Messiah Yeshua ( 1 Peter 2:5-10 ; Revelation 1:4-7 ). Finally, Sukkot is particularly significant for Gentiles, because
    Scripture prophecies the time when all the Gentile nations on earth will be
    required to join with Israel in keeping the Feast referred to in Zechariah
    14:16-19 . This appears to be a nation-to-nation mandate and not one
    directed to individuals. Although "rest" is not specifically mentioned in the supporting Scriptures
    for the Feast of Unleavened Bread and for Shavuot , it is strongly
    implied by the requirement that we not work. Also, although in Hebrews
    4:2-11 it is the weekly Sabbath rest that is analogized to resting in
    Messiah, its application to all of the annual Sabbaths is unmistakable. I am of the view that complying with these Annual Sabbaths by resting,
    abstaining from work, and assembling, is mandatory for Jews and K''rovei Yisrael Gentiles but, with the exception of the Feast of Sukkot is not mandatory for Gentiles generally. That notwithstanding,
    I believe that blessing comes to Gentiles who keep the Annual Sabbaths,
    analogous to the blessing for keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath that is
    promised in Isaiah 56:1-7 . Keeping the Annual Sabbaths also serves to
    connect Gentile believers to their Jewish brethren, and enhances
    understanding of the events in history that led to the Messiah''s coming
    and to the New Covenant. 1. According to Jewish tradition, the day
    subsequently defined as Shavuot is also the day on which the Torah was given at Mt. Sinai. 2. Hebrew for "Day of Firstfruits."'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Scripture speaks of keeping the Sabbath Day holy by abstaining from work,
    resting physically, and assembling for a holy convocation. Beyond those, it
    is well to remember that keeping the Sabbath Day holy means treating it as
    special, and setting it apart for God. That does not mean that we cannot
    engage in some things that are ordinary or recreational, but we need to use
    good judgment and maintain a Sabbath consciousness. One way of making the Sabbath special is to keep track of when it begins and
    when it ends. Jewish practice ushers in the Sabbath on Friday evening
    (before sundown) with the lighting of candles, Kiddush , prayer in
    either the home or synagogue, and enjoying a festive meal. There are
    traditionally three daytime services ( Shachrit , Musaf , and Minchah ) held on Shabbat , and the Shabbat is ended with Havdalah at sundown, after which begins the first day of the next
    work-week (albeit after sundown) with the evening service of ma''ariv . Within the wider Jewish community (and especially within the Orthodox
    community) there are other ways of making the Sabbath special as well. From
    the original Torah command to not light fires, Orthodox tradition has
    extended the uniqueness of the day to not turning on or off electric
    appliances including lights, and not driving cars (spark plugs make fire).
    In the same way, Torah is extended to not carrying things on one''s
    person outside of one''s home (not even a bible or siddur to the
    synagogue), and not spending money (if one does not carry it, one cannot
    spend it). In some communities, exceptions are made for those in the
    military and life-saving services. We who recognize the New Covenant have an additional depth of appreciation
    for the Sabbath''s holiness because of what Hebrews 4:4-11 says about
    it: For there is a place where it is said, concerning the seventh day, "And
    God rested on the seventh day from all his works." And once more, our
    present text says, "They will not enter my rest." Therefore, since it still
    remains for some to enter it, and those who received the Good News earlier
    did not enter, he again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David,
    so long afterwards, in the text already given, "Today, if you hear God''s
    voice, don''t harden your hearts." For if Y''hoshua had given them
    rest, God would not have spoken later of another "day." So there remains a
    Shabbat-keeping for God''s people. For the one who has entered
    God''s rest has also rested from his own works, as God did from his.
    Therefore, let us do our best to enter that rest; so that no one will fall
    short because of the same kind of disobedience.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is derived from the above Scriptures that teach
    (specifically or impliedly) that we must have humane compassion for the
    animals of God''s creation. Since acting cruelly is the opposite of acting
    humanely, this Mitzvah could have been expressed as "We are not to cruelly
    treat God''s creatures over which we have dominion." The emphasis on
    "dominion" (KJV and NKJV) is important in order to clarify that our rule over
    God''s created animals (as expressed in Genesis 1:26-28 ) is not without
    limits. We can use animals for our benefit (and may even slay them for
    appropriate and permitted reasons) but we are not to abuse them since they,
    as we, have feelings on varying levels of complexity. The most primitive of
    these feelings are pain, hunger, and procreative urges, but the higher forms
    of animals have other feelings as well that we call emotions. Although the
    relevance of each Scripture referenced above is, for the most part, clear on
    its face, I nevertheless offer the following explanatory comments: Exodus 20:9-10 and 23:12 compassionately extend Sabbath rest to
    our livestock. Exodus 23:5 requires that we help an enemy with his fallen animal,
    thereby showing compassion for both our enemy and for his animal. Deuteronomy 22:4 is similar and broader in applying, as well, to those
    who are not our enemies. Exodus 23:10-11 commands that we not cultivate or harvest our land
    during the Sabbatical Year, so that those who are poor among us (as well as
    the wild animals in the countryside) can eat from that which grows of its own
    accord. Exodus 23:19 and 34:26 both state that we must not boil a young
    goat in its mother''s milk. Interpreting these Scriptures literally leads to
    the traditional rabbinic prohibition against mixing dairy foods with meat
    which, I contend, is not their intended meaning. Boiling (perhaps killing in
    the process) a baby animal using its mother''s milk - milk intended for giving
    the young animal nourishment and life - is so perverted and inherently cruel
    a use of mother''s milk as to cry out to us: "Do not treat the animals of
    God''s creation inhumanely as do the heathens." Leviticus 22:28 teaches that slaughtering an animal and her young on
    the same day is wrong. Why is it wrong? I believe it is because it shows a
    callous disregard of the parental relationship that is holy even among
    animals. Deuteronomy 22:6-7 recognizes the probable maternal pain that a mother
    bird experiences when she sees her eggs or her young taken for our
    consumption. Releasing the mother bird first, spares her from witnessing the
    fate of her offspring, and frees her to bear other young to replace those
    that are lost. Deuteronomy 22:10 reminds us that it is inhumane to yoke together,
    animals that pull with different strengths, because the stronger of them
    inevitably drag the weaker. Deuteronomy 25:4 reminds us that it is inhumane to keep an animal from
    eating in a place where there is a visible and tempting abundance of food. Although human beings are among God''s "creatures", this Mitzvah is not
    intended to apply to human beings because humans do not have dominion over
    each other.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The third chapter of Leviticus discusses the procedure for peace
    offerings made by fire to the Lord and, in speaking of the fat of the
    offerings, Leviticus 3:16-17 states: The cohen will make them go up in smoke on the altar; it is food, an
    offering made by fire to be a fragrant aroma; all the fat belongs to ADONAI.
    It is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations wherever you
    live that you will eat neither fat nor blood. So, the rationale for not eating the fat of an animal is that the parts of
    the animal that have significant fat belong to God. That is why we offer up
    the fat to God as food in the Peace Offering, and why we do not eat it
    ourselves; it belongs to God. I am of the opinion that Leviticus 3 prohibits Jews and K''rovei Yisrael from eating any masses of fat that covers an
    animal''s inner organs, and any food in which animal fat is the main
    ingredient. 1 I express no opinion regarding the degree to which incidentally occurring
    fat must be removed from meat, nor do I believe that Scripture prohibits
    Jews and K''rovei Yisrael from eating marbleized meat (i.e. meat
    containing embedded particles of fat). Gentiles generally are not prohibited
    from eating fat, but many abstain for reasons related to health. Although not biblically required, choosing to only purchase
    rabbinically-certified meat is an easy and automatic way to comply with this Mitzvah as well as with several others having to do with kashrut . The biblical prohibition in Acts 15:19-21 against eating meat from
    strangled animals and food polluted by idols is often thought of in its
    context of applying to Gentiles. However, it is clearly applicable to Jews as
    well; that is what is meant by: For from the earliest times, Moshe has had in every city those who
    proclaim him, with his words being read in the synagogues every Shabbat. A matter that deserves some discussion, however, is the meaning of the
    expression " polluted by idols ". Some translations render this
    "offered to idols", or "sacrificed to idols", bringing to mind the ritual
    slaughter of an animal as part of pagan worship, and then bringing the meat
    home to eat. This kind of idol worship is rare in the developed world, but
    still may occur among pagan and satanic cults. We do sometimes encounter
    restaurants and food markets where there is evidence that the owners engage
    in idol worship (oriental restaurants especially), and we also encounter
    " halal " restaurants and markets where the meats are blessed by Muslim
    clerics in the name of Allah . In my opinion, the former is not a
    violation of Scripture so long as the food being offered for sale has not
    been involved in idolatrous rituals. The latter is more problematic and, in
    my opinion, eating such food should be avoided unless there is nothing else
    to eat. 1. "Animal fat" does not include the fat in milk.
    Consequently, butter, cheese, cream, and similar foods are permitted.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Seudat HaAdon (a/k/a Shulchan HaAdon ) is known by a variety of
    names in English as well; "Meal of the Lord", "Table of the Lord", "The
    Lord''s Supper", and "Holy Communion" are common. There is a mystery
    surrounding Seudat HaAdon because Yeshua spoke of his body and blood
    in present tense - i.e. "this is my body"; "this is my blood"; rather than
    his saying: "this represents my body"; "this represents my blood." Also, in
    his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul says of Yeshua: " whoever eats
    the Lord''s bread or drinks the Lord''s cup in an unworthy manner will be
    guilty of desecrating the body and blood of the Lord! " - again
    identifying the bread and wine with his body and blood in more than a
    symbolic way. These sayings of Yeshua have led the Roman Catholics to their doctrine of
    "transmutation", whereby they believe that the bread and wine taken in
    remembrance of Yeshua physically becomes his body and blood. While Messianic
    Judaism does not accept that the bread and wine of Yeshua physically
    transmutes, we do sense that when we take the elements of bread and wine,
    something of a spiritual nature occurs that is empowering and beyond mere
    symbolism. There is another controversy surrounding Seudat HaAdon , and that is
    when and how often it should be taken, and whether or not Yeshua intended it
    to be a sacrament as distinguished from a remembrance that occurs in the
    ordinary course of eating bread and drinking wine. Some say it is
    sacramental and should only be taken during the Passover seder meal
    since historically, that is the context in which Yeshua gave it to his
    disciples. Some say it is sacramental but can and should be taken on other
    occasions as well. Others say it is not sacramental, and that on every
    occasion in which we eat bread and drink wine we should declare it in
    remembrance of Yeshua. It is not my purpose here to prove or attempt to disprove any of these
    theories, but my own position is that Seudat HaAdon is intended as a
    sacrament to be taken during the Passover seder meal especially, and
    periodically at other times throughout the year as well. I do not believe
    that how often we take it is critical.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures that support this Mitzvah speak for themselves and, for
    the most part, require little embellishment. I will, however, comment on one
    of them that is often misunderstood. In 1 Thessalonians 5:17 (according to many translations) the Apostle Paul exhorts us to: Pray without ceasing. If looked at the Scripture wrongly, it seems impossible to do and still
    conduct the other affairs of life. Therefore, I believe that Paul is
    referring, not to formal prayer where we stop everything and speak with God,
    but rather to the continuous dialogue that believers are able to have with
    God as we walk with Him (and He with us) throughout the day.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The 10 th day of the seventh month is referred to in Leviticus 23:27 and 25:9 as Yom HaKippurim , and in Leviticus 23:28 as Yom Kippurim . Although the day appears in
    the plural in Scripture, it is more commonly known as Yom Kippur , and
    is translated "Day of Atonement". Because the CJB translates the above Scriptures differently than do several
    other highly regarded English translations, I had to decide which of them to
    rely upon in constructing this Mitzvah . The five Scripture verses at
    issue are: The CJB and NIV translate the four as "deny yourselves", and the KJV and NKJ
    translate them as "afflict your souls". The NAS version differs by
    translating the first three as "humble your souls", and Numbers 29:7 as "humble yourselves". The CJB and NIV both translate Leviticus 23:29 as "deny himself", the KJV translates it as "not be
    afflicted", the NKJ version translates it as "not afflicted in soul", and the
    NAS version translates it as "not humble himself". The weight of lexical authority appears to favor (and I have adopted) the
    view that we are commanded to afflict and humble our souls on Yom
    Kippur . The question is "What does that mean?" and "How are we to
    accomplish it?" Jewish tradition, based partially upon Scripture (e.g. Psalms 35:13 ; 69:10 ; Jeremiah 36:6 ), interprets "afflict
    your souls" as meaning that we are to fast from food and drink for
    twenty-five hours; this fast has become one of Yom Kippur ''s most
    well-known features. While fasting on Yom Kippur is certainly appropriate and a practice
    that I heartily endorse, I am of the opinion that THE TRUE BIBLICAL MEANING
    AND INTENT OF AFFLICTING OUR SOULS ON YOM KIPPUR IS THAT WE REPENT OF
    OUR SINS. Consider God''s admonition to the Israelites in Isaiah 58:1-8 : Shout out loud! Don''t hold back! Raise your voice like a shofar! Proclaim
    to my people what rebels they are, to the house of Ya''akov their sins. Oh
    yes, they seek me day after day and [claim to] delight in knowing my ways. As
    if they were an upright nation that had not abandoned the rulings of their
    God, they ask me for just rulings and [claim] to take pleasure in closeness
    to God, [asking,] ''Why should we fast, if you don''t see? Why mortify
    ourselves, if you don''t notice?'' Here is my answer: when you fast, you go
    about doing whatever you like, while keeping your laborers hard at work. Your fasts lead to quarreling and fighting, to lashing out with violent blows. On
    a day like today, fasting like yours will not make your voice heard on high.
    Is this the sort of fast I want, a day when a person mortifies himself? Is
    the object to hang your head like a reed and spread sackcloth and ashes under
    yourself? Is this what you call a fast, a day that pleases ADONAI? Here is
    the sort of fast I want - releasing those unjustly bound, untying the thongs
    of the yoke, letting the oppressed go free, breaking every yoke, sharing your
    food with the hungry, taking the homeless poor into your house, clothing the
    naked when you see them, fulfilling your duty to your kinsmen! Then your
    light will burst forth like the morning, your new skin will quickly grow over
    your wound; your righteousness will precede you, and ADONAI''s glory will
    follow you. The theme and purpose of Yom Kippur is repentance, and the above
    Scripture eschews any fast (including the Yom Kippur fast) that does
    not include it. We are familiar with the discomfort of not eating, so
    fasting might seem to be the primary and most logical way that God wants us
    to afflict our souls on Yom Kippur . Consider, however, how much more
    our souls are afflicted by our having to face the reality of our sins and
    repent, often with confession and restitution. Although afflicting our souls
    is called for, what is really sought from us is not bodily discomfort but
    repentance. Observance of Yom Kippur as a Shabbat and time for personal
    repentance is mandatory for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles, and
    recommended for other Gentile followers of Yeshua as well. Not only is
    repentance important for us personally, but it is necessary if we are to
    fulfill the priestly responsibilities that God has given to each of us.
    According to Exodus 19:6 , Israel has been made into a kingdom of
    priests (albeit not all of Israel are descended from Levitical priests) and,
    according to 1 Peter 2:9 and Revelation 5:10 , all New Covenant
    believers have become priests as well. This "priesthood of believers" is not
    for the purpose of sacrificing animals in an earthly temple, but for serving
    Yeshua who, as High Priest, entered the heavenly "Holy Place" by means of His
    own blood sacrifice ( Hebrews 9:11-12 ). So whether we are Jews or
    Gentiles, all disciples of Yeshua carry priestly responsibilities for which
    spiritual cleansing through repentance is a prerequisite. Note also that,
    whereas animal sacrifices (accompanied by repentance) conducted in the Temple
    merely covered over sins, Yeshua''s sacrifice (accompanied by repentance) in
    the New Covenant completely removes sin.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah refer to attitudes violently
    hostile to Yeshua that existed in the synagogues of First Century Jerusalem.
    That notwithstanding, Yeshua''s warnings are prophetic, and we see their
    fulfillment even today. The attitudes of most synagogues are still hostile
    to Yeshua, and although Jewish believers are no longer in mortal danger from
    them, persecution through ostracization is still very real. There are,
    however, many countries in the modern world where believers in Yeshua (both
    Jews and Gentiles) are not safe due to their faith, and where Jews are not
    safe merely for being Jews. We are warned to flee if we can, but we are not

    spirit of everything that is proffered to us so that we are not misled; 1
    John 4:2-3 tells us how: Here is how you recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit which
    acknowledges that Yeshua the Messiah came as a human being is from God, and

  commentary_rudolph: 'In the Mosaic Covenant, an Israelite would bring his animal sacrifice to the
    Temple (or the Tabernacle), and a Levitical cohen would assist him by
    slaying it, placing it on an altar, and offering it up to God in his behalf.
    The Israelite had to be ceremonially clean (i.e. ritually pure) to even enter
    the Temple''s sanctuary, but whether or not he was actually repentant (i.e.
    the condition of his heart was right) when he offered his sacrifice was known
    only to God. There is another Mosaic Covenant example of the need to
    approach God only when repentant, and that is Leviticus 16:11 ''s
    requirement that the High Priest sacrifice a bull for himself prior to
    sacrificing a goat for the sins of Israel on Yom Kippur . We also
    assume that the ten days between Yom T''ruah and Yom Kippur was
    for the purpose of all Israelites examining themselves and repenting of their
    sins (committed during the previous year) prior to their coming before the
    Lord on Yom Kippur . The various commandments requiring that the worshiper be ceremonially clean
    in order to enter the Holy Temple were, no doubt, given in order to remind
    him of God''s holiness, and that the house in which God chose to put His Name
    (i.e. where the Sh''khinah dwelt) must not be defiled. One thing is
    certain however - the worshipper''s sacrifice was only acceptable if his heart
    was repentant before God ( Genesis 4:3-7 ; Isaiah 1:15-19,
    59:1-2 ; Matthew 5:23-24 ). The Temple that stood in Jerusalem was built of brick and mortar but, in this
    era of the New Covenant, God''s presence (The Holy Spirit) lives in Temples
    made of flesh (the "bodies" of believers) and, therefore, in the "bodies" of
    each and every one of us who will have Him ( 1 Corinthians 3:16-17,
    6:19-20 ). That gives new meaning to the requirement that God''s Temple be
    undefiled. Today, the commandment has not to do with entering a physical
    Temple while in an unclean state; rather, it is allowing the Temple of our
    bodies to fall into a spiritually unclean state, thereby making it
    uninhabitable by the Holy Spirit. Spiritual uncleanliness is caused by sin,
    and it persists if there is no repentance. Our need for spiritual cleanness and repentance is illustrated by several
    Scriptures (listed above) that essentially state that God does not have
    fellowship with, nor does He even hear, those who are unrepentant of their
    sin (see Proverbs 15:29 ; Isaiah 59:1-2 ; 1 Corinthians
    11:27-29 ; and James 5:16 ).'

    authorities have been placed where they are by God. And how can Hebrews 13:17 say without qualification: Obey your leaders and submit to them. Are there not evil rulers that would command us to do ungodly things and yet
    we must obey them? It is indeed a conundrum unless we consider that the
    leaders spoken of are those referred to in Deuteronomy 17:14-20 -
    leaders approved by God, and governing with knowledge of Torah , and
    with intent to do God''s will. These rulers may be of our secular governments
    or they may be the elders of our congregations but, if we do what we ought to
    do - choose rulers that are approved by God and accountable to Him, all will
    be well. This requires that we be involved in the appointing process of our
    leaders, in order to make sure that whether king, or president, or governor,
    or congregational elder - our rulers will be of the mind and character to
    govern in godly ways. Yes, things go awry in this fallen world and, when
    they do, we must take our instruction from God (through the Holy Spirit) and
    rely on Him to set things right. And until things are set right, if we are

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Mosaic Law calls for a complete destruction of idolatry including, in
    many cases, killing idolaters themselves. During the time of Moses, the
    Israelites lived under a theocracy that was governed directly by God that
    made these practices reasonable, but today we live under (and are subject to)
    governments that are secular. The laws under which we live today do not
    allow us to apply many of the Mosaic Laws literally, and they should not
    allow it, because the governments under which we now live are not ruled by
    God. That notwithstanding, God''s extremely negative attitude toward idolatry
    should be adopted as our own, and we should seek the Holy Spirit for how to
    bring destruction to idolatry in every way that is permissible in our
    individual circumstances. Idolatry, in its broadest terms, comprises not only the worship of false
    deities, but anything that we allow to displace God in ruling our lives. Colossians 3:5 lists some of them and, although slaying idolatrous
    people is not authorized in the New Covenant, we are called to put to death
    instead, things such as sexual immorality, impurity, evil desires, and greed
    (see also, Matthew 6:24 ). Because today we live under secular laws and governments, we cannot do away
    with objects and places of idolatry that are owned by others. We cannot, for
    example, smash the statue of Buddha in our neighborhood Chinese restaurant,
    nor burn down the Hindu temple across town. We can, however, destroy and
    remove from our own houses and domains under our control, idolatry-connected
    art, jewelry, books, videos, and other such items that are owned by us, and
    we should. Similarly, we should not play games or view videos that depict
    idolatrous or occult practices, and should not show approval of those that
    do. As for the broader definition of idols, i.e. associations, things and
    practices that draw us toward unholy thoughts or deeds or that exercise power
    over us that is not from God - these we must renounce and do away with, and
    help others to do so as well.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Hebrew word for "our God" in Deuteronomy 6:4 is " Eloheynu ",
    which is the first person plural possessive of " Elohim " - a word
    which, despite its plurality, all Genesis 1:1 translators agree means
    "God". In addition, the English word "one" in Deuteronomy 6:4 is the
    Hebrew word " echad ", which is a composite (and not an absolute) unity.
    So, while our God is plural in His nature, He is one God and not many Gods
    combined into one. This is a great mystery for which we have no natural
    example to aid our understanding. Wherever it occurs in Scripture, the Hebrew word " Elohim " (along with
    its derivatives), although plural, is universally translated as "God", and
    the Hebrew word " echad ", a composite unity, is most often translated
    "one".'

  commentary_rudolph: 'God has always required that mankind worship and obey Him, which is a form of
    dedication. Nevertheless, from very early times, God chose certain men to
    dedicate 3 their lives to Him in a special way. Sometimes God imposed it on them and
    sometimes it was voluntary. Sometimes they were referred to as priests, but
    not always. Let''s start with God''s covenant with Abraham. The Scriptures
    show that there was a voluntary relationship between Abraham and God, but
    there came a time when God gave Abraham a covenant that was not voluntary on
    Abraham''s part. The covenant had several components to it, but the bottom
    line was that Abraham and his descendants were to be dedicated to God for
    special service. We know this because, by the time of Moses, God was
    referring to the children of Israel (Israelites) as a " kingdom of cohanim
    for me, a nation set apart " ( Exodus 19:6 ). But God went further
    than that, and commanded that the firstborn of every Israelite and every
    animal within the camp of Israel must be dedicated to His service: Exodus 13:1-2 ADONAI said to Moshe, "Set aside for me all the firstborn. Whatever is
    first from the womb among the people of Isra''el, both of humans and of
    animals, belongs to me. Then God reversed Himself. He ordered that all the firstborn of the
    Israelites be redeemed from their service, and He dedicated Aaron and his
    sons (from the tribe of Levi) to be priests instead: Numbers 3:10a You are to appoint Aharon and his sons to carry out the duties of
    cohanim And He dedicated the rest of the Levites to serve Aaron and his sons in
    carrying out their priestly functions: Numbers 3:9 Assign the L''vi''im to Aharon and his sons; their one
    responsibility in regard to the people of Isra''el is to serve him. Numbers 3:11-12 ADONAI said to Moshe, "I have taken the L''vi''im from among the
    people of Isra''el in lieu of every firstborn male that is first from the
    womb among the people of Isra''el; the L''vi''im are to be
    mine." All of the dedications referred to up to now were imposed dedications; they
    were not voluntary. But there came a time when God allowed a very special
    kind of dedication that could be either imposed or volunteered for, and those
    who were so dedicated were called "Nazirites". The voluntary Nazirite vow of
    dedication was normally for a specified season, after which the person who
    took the vow was released. The law of the Nazirite is partially as follows: Numbers 6:2-8 Tell the people of Isra''el, ''When either a man or a woman makes
    a special kind of vow, the vow of a nazir, consecrating himself to ADONAI; he
    is to abstain from wine and other intoxicating liquor, he is not to drink
    vinegar from either source, he is not to drink grape juice, and he is not to
    eat grapes or raisins. As long as he remains a nazir he is to eat nothing
    derived from the grapevine, not even the grape-skins or the seeds.
    Throughout the period of his vow as a nazir, he is not to shave his head.
    Until the end of the time for which he has consecrated himself to ADONAI he
    is to be holy: he is to let the hair on his head grow long. Throughout the
    period for which he has consecrated himself to ADONAI, he is not to approach
    a corpse. He is not to make himself unclean for his father, mother, brother
    or sister when they die, since his consecration to God is on his head.
    Throughout the time of his being a nazir he is holy for ADONAI. Because there are other requirements for the Nazirite that require the Temple
    and the Levitical priests, it is not possible to become a Nazirite today and,
    by the grace of God it is not needed any longer. The reason it is not needed
    is that today, our vow of dedication to Yeshua as Lord of our lives is the
    New Covenant equivalent of the Nazirite vow and more: Romans 10:8 and 12:1 that if you acknowledge publicly with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and
    trust in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be delivered
    ... I exhort you, therefore, brothers, in view of God''s mercies, to
    offer yourselves as a sacrifice, living and set apart for God. This will
    please him; it is the logical "Temple worship" for you. In the New Covenant, this new way of dedicating ourselves to God is both
    available to everyone and required of everyone. 3. "Dedicate" and "Consecrate" are interchangeable.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah combines several commandments, each employing a physical
    object to remind the Israelites of the commandments of God, and His having
    brought us out of Egypt. There are four kinds of these reminders: (a)
    something worn on the hand; (b) something worn on the forehead; (c) something
    affixed to the doorpost and gates of one''s house; and (d) tzitziyot 1 containing a blue thread worn on the clothing. The Orthodox position and that
    of the classical commentators is that each of these is intended by God to be
    done literally, but some argue that they are metaphoric. I am inclined to view binding to the hand and forehead as metaphoric and
    placing on the doorposts of houses as literal, but they are found in adjacent
    verses of Scripture and, by normal principles of exegesis, the three of them
    should therefore be viewed all one way or all the other. On the other hand,
    I cannot say that the three of them are metaphoric and that wearing t''fillin is a misapplication of Scripture because, in Matthew 23:5 , Yeshua criticizes the Pharisees for how they construct
    and wear their t''fillin , but He does not admonish the Pharisees for
    wearing them. Nevertheless, an argument for believing that binding to the
    hand and forehead is not meant to be literal is that the expression "as a
    sign on your hand and as a reminder between your eyes" is found in Scripture
    as a sign of several different things. Deuteronomy 6:4-9 appears to
    be saying that God''s commandments are a sign, Exodus 13:5-10 appears
    to be saying that matzah is a sign, and Exodus 13:11-16 appears
    to be saying that redeeming the firstborn is a sign. Wearing tzitziyot containing a thread of blue is clearly intended to
    be literal because of its specificity, and its consistency with the simple
    four-cornered style of garments worn during the time of Moses; also, Yeshua
    apparently wore them ( Matthew 9:20, 14:36 ; Luke 8:44 ). The
    question that modern Jews must answer for themselves is whether God intends tzitziyot to be worn today when the type and style of clothing is not
    as before. In Orthodox Jewish communities all men wear tzitziyot , and
    there is discussion about whether they are also appropriate for women to
    wear, but women normally do not wear them. In communities that have not
    adopted a position on the wearing of tzitziyot , each individual must
    make his own decision about whether to wear them as described in Scripture or
    to substitute some other article of clothing or accessory that will
    accomplish the same thing - reminding anyone seeing them of the commandments
    of God. What fringes are is self-evident, so the remaining decisions (other than
    whether to wear them at all) are what to construct them of, whether and how
    to knot them, what the color and origin of the blue dye for the thread should
    be, and what articles of clothing to attach them to. Since the only
    requirement in Scripture is that they be placed on the corners of garments,
    unless one''s community defines the particulars of acceptable tzitziyot , the wearer can use his own judgment on all of these. The
    orthodox Jewish community has adopted detailed rules for manufacturing tzitziyot which their male members wear under their shirts or vests
    and attached to a special four-cornered garment called a tallit katan . Tzitziyot are also worn on the traditional rectangular prayer shawl,
    the tallit gadol . The way to make and use t''fillin is not defined in Scripture, so one
    who chooses to wear them either adopts the Orthodox construction and usage,
    or exercises individual creativity. One contemporary kind of t''fillin I have seen consisted of a cloth bracelet and headband, both embroidered with
    words from Scripture; the bracelets were worn the entire day, and the
    headband only during prayer. The same latitude exists for making and placing m''zuzot . I have seen them made from tubes of diverse materials
    containing hand-written parchments or pieces of paper, and also made in the
    form of wood and ceramic plaques on which were engraved words of Scripture. It is important not to get so involved in the details of these "reminders"
    that we forget what they are supposed to remind us of, which are the
    commandments of God. We are not only to be reminded by them, but to be made
    continually aware of God''s Word as we proceed through each day. This is the
    sense I receive from (1) the Numbers 15 Scripture that speaks of not
    going around after where our own hearts and eyes lead us, and from (2) the Deuteronomy 6 Scripture that speaks of talking about God''s words as we
    walk by the way. These commandments were given to the Israelites thousands of years ago, and
    those who heard them directly from Moses no doubt knew exactly what God
    meant; if they didn''t, they could simply have asked Moses for clarification.
    We are living in an age where many things have changed - clothing styles,
    home styles, life styles, work schedules, etc., and we do not have Moses with
    us to ask. We do, however, have God Himself with us and in us in the person
    of the Ruach HaKodesh , so it is to Him that each of us should appeal
    for clarification. I came to my own conviction about wearing tzitziyot in this very way. Because I understood the principle behind
    wearing them, I considered wearing a necklace of the tablets of the Torah instead, reasoning that they too would remind me and others of
    the Word of God. However, after praying for guidance, the guidance I
    received from God was that He wanted me to wear tzitziyot because His
    plans for me (as well as for other Jews), made it important that I be
    perceived as a Messianic Jew who respected the community''s traditions. I
    recommend this "New Covenant" approach of seeking guidance from the Ruach
    HaKodesh for not only these matters, but for all of life''s questions;
    God''s Ruach was made available to us for that very purpose. In summary, I lean toward believing that the commandment to place God''s words
    on our hands and, foreheads are meant as metaphors to impress on us that
    God''s Word must form what we do and what we think. I cannot say so for sure,
    however, because of the Matthew 23:5 Scripture I mentioned earlier. I
    can go either way regarding m''zuzot , but it is clear to me that the
    commandment to wear tzitziyot is meant to be literal (see the
    Scriptures indicating that Yeshua wore them), but that God may allow
    substitutions on an individual basis. That notwithstanding, I consider the traditional literal ways of observance
    to be valid implementations of the Scriptures so long as their broader
    message is understood and pursued. One likely case for God allowing or even
    desiring substitution in all of these may be for Gentiles living among Jews.
    The principles are applicable to Gentiles, but the traditional ways of
    observing the commandments have become almost completely associated with
    being Jewish. Another case for substitution would be for women, for whom the
    commandments are also applicable, but the traditional ways of observing them
    have become almost completely associated with being male. 1. ''fringes'''

  commentary_rudolph: 'The first part of Genesis 1:28 states: " God blessed them: God said
    to them, ''Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth ...'' " Notice that the
    commandment to "be fruitful" in Genesis 1:28 comes before the command
    to "multiply," and that the rest of the verse: and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and
    every living creature that crawls on the earth. instructs us that we have an obligation to produce value from our multiplied
    numbers - in other words, disseminate our fruitfulness. The agricultural analogy is that fruit comes first and contains the seeds
    from which reproduction or multiplication of the plant occurs. Then, the more
    multiplication the more the fruit, so it is an unending cycle. We see God''s expectation that we multiply (increase) in fruitfulness
    elsewhere in Scripture as well. In Genesis 35:10-11 , for example, God
    repeats his commandment to Israel (Jacob) to multiply, but God also says that
    a nations and kings will be descended from him, implying that Israel''s
    descendants will have functions to fulfill with their numbers. Of course we
    know from Exodus 19:6 that one of the areas of Israel''s fruitfulness
    is that it is destined to " be a kingdom of cohanim " - " a nation set
    apart. " In Acts 9:31 , when we are told that the Messianic Community multiplied
    in number, it is not to inform us of their reproductive fertility, but of the
    fact that belief in Yeshua spread throughout the area. Similarly, Colossians 1:6 speaks of the Good News " being fruitful and
    multiplying ", and Colossians 1:10 speaks of " being fruitful in
    every good work and multiplying in the full knowledge of God. " It appears
    clear that God''s desire for Israel and for all of mankind is that we multiply
    (increase) in both number and fruitfulness. Now a word about reproduction and marriage. The Genesis commandment
    to multiply was given after man was created to be male and female, but prior
    to God having made Eve ( Genesis 2:18-24 ). Although reproduction was
    not mentioned in the context of marriage, after God made Eve, He caused her
    and Adam to become "one flesh" ( verse 24 ) and, since then, God
    intended reproduction between man and woman to be only in the context of
    covenant marriage. Reproduction is so implicitly part of the marriage
    covenant, that a party who refuses to bear children against the wishes of his
    or her mate may well be ruled to have abandoned the marriage covenant. The controversy regarding the use of birth control measures by consenting
    married persons cannot be definitively resolved within this Mitzvah .
    I do, however, express my opinion that methods of birth control that do not
    kill or abort fetuses are permitted because (1) Scripture allows unmarried
    persons to avoid having children by remaining single ( Matthew 9:12 ; 1 Corinthians 7:8 ), and (2) in Paul''s warning to married persons that
    they should not deprive each other of sexual relations ( 1 Corinthians
    7:3-5 ), the reason he gives is not that deprivation violates a
    commandment to reproduce, but rather " because of your lack of
    self-control, you may succumb to the Adversary''s
    temptation. " 1 And then, Paul follows up in verse 6 with: " I am giving you this as
    a suggestion, not as a command. " I deduce from this that since agreed-to
    abstinence between married persons is not a sin, so neither is preventing
    conception through other non-lethal means. Finally, Genesis 1:28 requires that mankind, as a species, reproduce,
    but it does not command that all persons or couples reproduce. Certainly
    unmarried persons should not, persons with certain medical conditions cannot,
    and there may be some that God specifically calls to remain unmarried ( 1
    Corinthians 7:8 ). 1. See also, Exodus 21:7-11 (Maimonides

  commentary_rudolph: 'We see from the Scriptures presented that the people of Israel - the Jewish
    People - are God''s chosen people (He calls them sons) and therefore blessed
    and protected by Him. His protection at any point in time is conditioned on
    Israel''s obedience to Him but, it transcends the times of their punishment,
    and returns when Israel repents. But it is for God to judge and punish
    Israel when He deems it needed, and not for anyone else. Even when God used
    an enemy nation to punish Israel, he did so by using a nation that deserved
    and was destined for punishment itself because it was already hostile to
    Israel. To bring the matter more up to date, the Apostle Paul said in Romans
    11:7-8 : What follows is that Isra''el has not attained the goal for which she is
    striving. The ones chosen have obtained it, but the rest have been made
    stonelike, just as the Tanakh says, ''God has given them a spirit of dullness
    - eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, right down to the present
    day.'' More and more, the Jewish people are having the scales of blindness fall
    from their eyes and are receiving Yeshua, and it would therefore be well to
    remember what Paul also said in Romans 11:25-27 : For, brothers, I want you to understand this truth which God formerly
    concealed but has now revealed, so that you won''t imagine you know more than
    you actually do. It is that stoniness, to a degree, has come upon Isra''el,
    until the Gentile world enters in its fullness; and that it is in this way
    that all Isra''el will be saved. As the Tanakh says, ''Out of Tziyon will come
    the Redeemer; he will turn away ungodliness from Ya''akov and this will be my
    covenant with them ... when I take away their sins.'' In view of that and all else that has been presented, it would behoove both
    individuals and nations to receive the blessing and not the cursing that is
    promised for blessing and not cursing the Jewish people.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is sometimes referred to as "Love your neighbor as
    yourself," and sometimes "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
    The "love" alluded to in this Mitzvah is not a love of feeling or
    emotion, but of doing for others what is best for them because we genuinely
    care about them. And why should we care about our neighbor, the stranger
    ( ger ), and our enemy? It is because they, like we, are created by our
    Heavenly Father and we are, in that sense, brothers and sisters. Moreover,
    Scripture (e.g. John 3:16 ) tells us that God loves his entire creation
    so, if we care about God, we must also care about those for whom He cares.
    Also, the Book of 1 John tells us: 1 John 3:10-11 : Here is how one can distinguish clearly between God''s children and those
    of the Adversary: everyone who does not continue doing what is right is not
    from God. Likewise, anyone who fails to keep loving his brother is not from
    God. 1 John 4:7-9 : Beloved friends, let us love one another; because love is from God; and
    everyone who loves has God as his Father and knows God. Those who do not
    love, do not know God; because God is love. Here is how God showed his love
    among us: God sent his only Son into the world, so that through him we might
    have life. 1 John 4:20-21 : If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if
    a person does not love his brother, whom he has seen, then he cannot love
    God, whom he has not seen. Yes, this is the command we have from him:
    whoever loves God must love his brother too. Some of the Scriptures that support this Mitzvah require that we love
    our Israelite (Jewish) brothers, some our brothers in the faith, some our
    neighbors, some strangers ( gerim ), some our enemies, and some people
    in general. No matter. Yeshua directs us to maintain an attitude of love
    toward all and, in this world of modern communication and modes of travel,
    our neighbor may be half-a-world away. In Luke 10:29 , a Torah scholar, seeking to justify withholding love, asked Yeshua: And who is my neighbor? Yeshua side-stepped answering him directly and, instead, told a story and
    then turned the question back to the scholar by asking him which of three
    persons in the story qualified as a neighbor? When the scholar answered that
    it was the one who showed another mercy, Yeshua neither affirmed nor
    disaffirmed his answer, but merely said to him in Luke 10:37 : You go and do as he did. Yeshua''s answer and the Scriptures that support this Mitzvah lead us
    to understand that we are to love ("as ourselves") every human being with
    whom we relate. That means that we are to desire for each person, that which
    we would want for ourselves, were we them. In truth, obeying this Mitzvah (especially as it applies to enemies) requires great faith and
    dying to self, which is the mark of a mature and discipled person. To be sure, the acts of love we show toward a peaceful neighbor are not
    expected to be the same as those we show toward an enemy who is intent on
    killing us. So, for example, we may personally visit our hungry neighbor
    with a gift of food but, if our enemy''s heart is dark and he wants to do us
    harm, perhaps the most loving thing we can do for him is to make sure that he
    cannot find us. That is not an attempt at humor. If our enemy is able to
    find and harms us, it will be counted against him as sin, and we should not
    want that for him. An example from the Bible of this, is David hiding from
    Saul who was intent on killing him ( 1 Samuel 19-24 ). As a side matter, I should say a few words about Proverbs 25:21-22 ''s,
    and Romans 12:19-20 ''s use of the expression " you will heap fiery
    coals on his
    head. " 1 Why would God approve of such a seemingly harmful act that appears to be the
    antithesis of loving our neighbor? Historians inform us that, in ancient
    times, the expression was understood as a blessing and not a cursing. Fires
    were difficult to start so, when possible, a person who wanted and needed to
    start a fire for his warmth or food would ask his neighbor for one or two
    glowing hot coals from his already-thriving fire. The fiery coals were
    customarily carried to their new location in a container placed on one''s head
    and protected by an insulating mat. Heaping fiery coals on our neighbor''s
    head rather than giving him just one or two coals was, therefore, considered
    a generous favor. 1. The CJB translation renders the expression: " you
    will heap fiery coals [of shame] on his head. " I see no justification
    for inserting " [of shame] " and have omitted it. I suppose the
    translator''s logic is that if you bless your neighbor who hates you,
    he will feel shame for his hate and repent.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The history of God choosing certain men to set apart as His priests, holy
    unto Himself, begins with God''s promise to Abraham that through him, all the
    Nations of the earth will be blessed" ( Genesis 22:18 ). We see this
    continuing in the Mosaic Covenant where Israel is made by God to be a
    "kingdom of priests ( cohanim ), a nation set apart" ( Exodus
    19:5-6 ), and Aaron and his sons are installed as priests ( Exodus
    28:1-3 ), also "set apart" ( Leviticus 21:8 ). Then, later, in the
    New Covenant, Yeshua is made a High Priest ( Cohen Gadol ) in the order
    of Malki-Tzedek ( Hebrews 5:4-6 ), and all disciples of Yeshua are made cohanim under Him ( 2 Peter 2:9-10 ). Notwithstanding the change in the covenant ( Hebrews 8:13 ) and our loss
    of the Jerusalem Temple, the Judaism that survives today retains a few
    functions for those believed to be descended (patrilinearly) from the early
    Levitical cohanim . 1 Among these functions are making aliyot to the bima (going up
    to read from the Torah during services), the privilege of redeeming
    firstborn Jewish sons (the ceremony of Pidyon HaBen ), and imparting
    the Birkat Cohanim (Priestly Blessing or Aaronic Benediction) over
    synagogue congregants. In Messianic Jewish congregations, the Birkat
    Cohanim is generally ministered by the presiding leader of a service in
    recognition of the New Covenant''s expansion of priestly holiness to all
    believers. 1. Historically, cohanim were only men;
    today, however, there is a movement within Reform and Reconstructionist
    Judaism to extend the status of cohanim to women; this is not
    generally accepted within Messianic Judaism.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The term "hypocrite" is often applied to persons who seek to correct others
    while being in significant fault themselves. According to Galatians 6:1 , it is right for us to correct a brother who is caught
    doing something sinful, provided that we do so " in a spirit of humility,
    keeping an eye on [ourselves] so that [we] won''t be tempted too. " A key
    aspect of humility is our willingness to judge our own conduct against what
    is taught in Scripture, and especially before seeking to correct our
    neighbor''s. Notice that I said "correct" and not "judge" when our neighbor
    is not a brother or sister believer. Passing judgment is authoritative, and
    goes further than merely seeking to correct. According to 1 Corinthians
    5:12-13 , believers are authorized to judge one other, but are not to
    judge those outside the body of believers: For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Isn''t it those who are
    part of the community that you should be judging? God will judge those who
    are outside. Just expel the evildoer from among yourselves.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah to be subject to governing authorities is often debated
    among scholars. We know by the Mitzvah ''s date and context that the
    governing authorities referred to included those of Rome, so the application
    of Romans 13:1 today undoubtedly contemplates secular governments on
    all levels. But how can the Scripture say that all authorities that exist have been
    established and placed where they are by God, when evil governments such as
    Nazi Germany are fresh in our minds? Should we have cooperated with Nazi
    Germany rather than war against her? As absurd as that is, if Romans
    13:1 were the only Scripture on the subject, one might come to that
    conclusion. But let us consider Acts 5:27-29 which seems to say
    something quite different; it says: They conducted them to the Sanhedrin, where the cohen hagadol demanded of
    them, "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this [Yeshua''s] name! Look
    here! you have filled Yerushalayim with your teaching; moreover, you are
    determined to make us responsible for this man''s death!" Kefa and the other
    emissaries answered, "We must obey God, not men." How do we reconcile Romans 13 with Acts 5 ? Some have attempted
    to explain Romans 13 by asserting that it refers merely to Rome''s
    authority to assess and collect taxes. That, in my opinion is wrong. No, I
    suggest that the answer lies rather in the definition of "authority" - that
    not all persons and governments that claim to be authorities are, in fact,
    authorities. Stated differently, an alleged "authority" is not an authority
    if it is not from God. Any government that willfully commits gross sin or
    that leads persons for which it is responsible into sin is no authority at
    all, and we ought to oppose it. With that understanding, we can
