  commandment: We are not to be unequally yoked in matters of godly importance.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures supporting this mitzvah appear to have three dissimilar themes: agriculture, marriage, and idolatry. What they all have in common, however, are sets of things that work in opposition to each other, causing a nullification of positive value that one of them alone might otherwise have had. First, the agricultural examples: (1) that we not yoke an ox and a donkey together to a plow, (2) that we not wear garments with wool and linen woven together, and (3) that we not sow two kinds of seeds in fields and in vineyards. The traditional explanation for not working two kinds of animals together is that it is cruel to the animals since the stronger of the two will drag the weaker one, and the weaker of the two will impede the stronger one. An additional observation offered here is that the work that either of the animals could do alone is impeded by their having to pull against each other. Maimonides'' explanation (echoed by HaChinuch) for not wearing wool and
    linen woven together is that such a fabric was worn by the heathen priests in Egypt. From a different point of view and the one I offer here is that wool and linen shrink different amounts after they are wet, so if they are woven together, they pull against each other when they dry and weaken the fabric. HaChinuch''s explanation for not sowing two kinds of seed is that it is an extension of the prohibition against mating mixed species. From a different point of view and the one I offer here is that different species of plants absorb nutrients from the soil in different proportions, so when they are planted close together they compete for the nutrients to the detriment of both. Consider the marriage examples next: 2 Corinthians 6:14-17 explains it best (although marriage is not mentioned in that Scripture) when it states: What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement can there be between the temple of God and idols? Without agreement on spiritual things between
    husband and wife, the husband cannot lead the wife, they pull in different directions, and destruction follows, sometimes with the believer compromising his or her faith. Finally, consider the idolatry examples: Israel was prohibited from making covenants with heathen nations and intermarrying with their sons and daughters for the same reason as was stated between believers and unbelievers. God predicted that if that happened, Israelites would be lured away from God and into idol worship, as He said in Deuteronomy 7:4 : For he will turn your children away from following me in order to serve other gods. Whereas, the classical commentators tend to interpret the Scriptures of this mitzvah according to the plain meaning of their words and separate from each other, I see them as connected by their common thread of forces pulling against each other. Clearly, the weight of this Mitzvah ''s application is that, if we belong to God, we must not yoke ourselves with anything or anyone who is not
    of God. Marriage is the most obvious example, followed perhaps by other partnerships like business partnerships. People who do not believe similarly about God hold different values, and take different ethical and moral positions on things. This either causes the believer to compromise, or it breaks up the partnership. As Matthew 6:24 states: No one can be slave to two masters. If 2 Corinthians 6:14-17 were the only subject of this Mitzvah I could have given it the more narrow title "Being Unequally Yoked with Unbelievers". I did not, because but even in a partnership between two believers, the partnership is unwise if the partners see things very differently and respond accordingly. In this, the Scriptures have very far-reaching wisdom.'
  classical_commentators: 'None of Maimonides'', Meir''s, or HaChinuch''s mitzvot oppose unequal yoking in general. Rather, their mitzvot speak to specific prohibitions against combining dissimilar items combinations; Maimonides'' mitzvot prohibiting such combinations are as follows: RN42: Not wearing cloth made from both wool and linen. RN52: Not marrying an heretic. RN158: A priest not marrying a harlot. RN159: A priest not marrying a profaned woman. RN215: Not sowing two kinds of seeds. RN216: Not sowing grain or vegetables among grape vines. RN218: Not working a field with two different kinds of animals.'

  commandment: We are to guard our physical & spiritual health, and be separate from the heathen nations through ritual purifications & cleanness.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The concept of ritual cleanness (clean vs. unclean) originates early in the Bible. Most of us have an intuitive sense of what it means to be clean physically, but when something is called "clean" or "unclean" in the Bible, there is usually a spiritual statement being made about it in that only what God declares to be clean is fit to be brought into His presence. So, for example, an unblemished lamb is still considered clean and was suitable for sacrificial worship (under Moses) even if it had recently rolled in mud. A pig, on the other hand, is unclean, and was unfit for sacrificial worship even had it been scrupulously washed down with soap and water. According to the Bible, things are intrinsically clean or unclean and, in addition, things (and persons) that are otherwise ritually clean, can become unclean for a time, according to where they have been, what they have done, or what they have touched. So, for example, a man is intrinsically clean, becomes temporarily
    unclean by touching a corpse, and returns to being clean at nightfall. A pig, on the other hand, is intrinsically unclean and can never be made clean. The concept of ritual cleanness is also connected to holiness (spiritual cleanness), and is exemplified by the fate of those who drank alcoholic beverages in the tent of meeting; for we read in Leviticus 10:9-10 : Don''t drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor, neither you nor your sons with you, when you enter the tent of meeting, so that you will not die. This is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations, so that you will distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean Yeshua considered the distinction between clean and unclean to be important, for he analogized it to holiness & wickedness in Luke 11:37-42 : As Yeshua spoke, a Parush asked him to eat dinner with him; so he went in and took his place at the table; and the Parush was surprised that he didn''t begin by doing n''tilat
    yadayim before the meal. However, the Lord said to him, "Now then, you P''rushim, you clean the outside of the cup and plate; but inside, you are full of robbery and wickedness. Fools! Didn''t the One who made the outside make the inside too? Rather, give as alms what is inside, and then everything will be clean for you! But woe to you P''rushim! You pay your tithes of mint and rue and every garden herb, but you ignore justice and the love of God. You have an obligation to do these things - but without disregarding the others! Animals, objects, food, and even people are either clean or unclean and, apart from their respective acceptability in temple worship, they sometimes have an obvious connection to health as well. For example, Leviticus 13 reads like a medical text on how to diagnose and treat leprosy, and how to protect the population from its contagion. Some also try to make the case that eating non-kosher animals such as pig is unhealthy, but I do not attempt to make that case.
    It is clear how all of the ritual cleanness regulations had literal applicability in the time of Moses, but what about now? We have no Tabernacle or Temple today, leprosy (looked at by most scholars today as skin infections that include leprosy) is quickly and easily curable, and there is no functioning Levitical priesthood today to enforce the Mosaic regulations. Nevertheless, the laws of ritual cleanness serve to remind us that maintaining our physical health is a godly value that we must pursue rigorously. It is impossible to literally obey all of the ritual cleanness laws today. There remains, however, an area of analogy to these laws, and that is to conduct ourselves in such a way that we (both as Jews broadly and as Jewish or Gentile disciples of Yeshua) who are believers are distinguishable from those who are not. God also wants Jews to be distinguishable from non-Jews because He gave Israel a commission to be a "kingdom of priests" to the other nations of the world. God wants
    disciples of Yeshua to be distinguishable because all disciples of Yeshua (Jewish and non-Jewish disciples alike) have a responsibility to influence those who are not believers by what we say and how we are observed to live our lives. For those of us that are Jews, we have a plethora of traditional practices to draw from, many of which come directly from the biblical laws of ritual cleanness. One that tops the list is that we do not eat anything that comes from a pig. Two others are that we do not eat any land animal that does not have a split hoof and does not chew its cud, and we do not eat anything from the water that lacks fins and scales. There are, of course, other characteristics that distinguish us as well, such as our keeping of the Sabbath and the Appointed Times, wearing fringes with blue strands, and tacking m''zuzot to the doorposts of our houses. Ritual purification ceremonies survive today in the Orthodox Jewish practice of total immersion in mikvahs (specially constructed
    baths of water), and in the washing of the hands and fingers before and after meals (respectively), and at other times prescribed by Rabbinical tradition. Common reasons for total immersion are purification at the end of a woman''s menstrual cycle, by a woman prior to her wedding, and as part of conversion to Judaism. For those of us that are believers but are not Jews, some (but not all) of the Jewish identifying features are appropriate. For most of us, however, it is how we are observed to maintain godly values, in the things we say, and in how we live our lives. A list of items considered clean and unclean that are given in Leviticus 11 to Leviticus 15 , Leviticus 22 , & Deuteronomy 23 appear in the appendix to this Mitzvah below.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch chose a sampling of Scriptures about which to write their mitzvot on ritual (ceremonial) cleanness, leaving many unaddressed. Other than what is obvious when it pertains to leprosy, they did not connect ritual cleanness to health, or separation of the Jewish nation and, in their expositions of immersion, their emphases are more to the physical than to the spiritual.

  commandment: We may partake of wine but must not become intoxicated.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The above Scriptures speak for themselves. Drunkenness is prohibited; drinking wine in moderation is not. Wine is used in various ways within Messianic Judaism - as one of the elements in the Shulchan Adonai (the Lord's Table), for Kiddush , for Havdalah , and as a celebratory beverage.
  classical_commentators: Of the numerous Scriptures that command against becoming intoxicated through drinking, Maimonides and HaChinuch quote only Leviticus 10:8-11 that prohibits priests from entering the Temple after drinking wine or other intoxicating liquor. Meir does not address the subject at all.

  commandment: We are to be born again from above.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The common understanding of scholars is that Yeshua''s exhortation to Nicodemus in John 3:7 that he "must be born again from above" was a reference to his first birth being from the waters of natural childbirth. There is, however, another way to understand this, and that is that man''s first birth was also from above - from the waters of creation ( Genesis 1:1-2 ) - and that man''s original death due to Adam''s disobedience required that he be "born again from above" in order for him to have eternal life, which was God''s original intention. One might argue that being "born again" (while it is God''s desire for us all) is not a true mitzvah because the power to accomplish it is God''s and not ours. True, the supernatural power to cause a man to be born from above is God''s alone, but God gave us the key to unleash His power by receiving His son Yeshua - our Messiah - as we read in John 3:14-16 : Just as Moshe lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of
    Man be lifted up; so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life, instead of being utterly destroyed. Trusting [NKJ: Believing in] Yeshua as our Messiah (savior) means repenting of our former unbelief and accepting his sacrificial death as ours, and our means of receiving God''s forgiveness. Now every cohen stands every day doing his service, offering over and over the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this one, after he had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God, from then on to wait until his enemies be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has brought to the goal for all time those who are being set apart for God and made holy. ( Hebrews 10:11-14 ) As a Messianic Jewish believer in Yeshua I am sometimes confronted with the following question or a variation of it: "I
    consider myself a good person. All the things the Bible teaches I try to do, and all the virtues the Bible teaches I try to have. Are you telling me that just because I do not believe that Yeshua is the Messiah I am destined for Hell?" My answer to the question is always the same: "Your standing with God and your salvation are not for me to judge, nor is it for me to tell God whom he can save and whom He cannot. I can only tell you that Acts 4:12 of the New Covenant Scriptures teaches that " There is salvation in no one else " [meaning no one other than Yeshua], and that "there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by whom we must be saved! " Notice that the Scripture I quoted is God''s promise that if you repent of your sins and receive Yeshua as your Messiah, YOU WILL BE SAVED! If you want to take your chances and negotiate with God for some other way to heaven, that''s up to you. But If you want to be sure of your salvation, I would advise you to do it the way that God guaranteed."'

This new heart with the Torah embedded in it was to be a clean heart with a new Spirit, and it came to fruition as part of the New Covenant and man''s "new birth" in Yeshua: John 3:3 "Yes, indeed," Yeshua answered him, "I tell you that unless a person is born again from above, he cannot see the Kingdom of God." John 3:6 What is born from the flesh is flesh, and what is born from the Spirit is spirit. 2 Corinthians 5:1 Therefore, if anyone is united with the Messiah, he is a new creation - the old has passed; look, what has come is fresh and new! 1 Peter 1:23 You have been born

  commandment: We are to aspire to God's perfection & holiness.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'At first impression, Matthew 5:48 ( Therefore, be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect ) and Leviticus 11:45 ( Therefore you are to be holy, because I am holy ) seem highly presumptuous and even blasphemous. As God''s creation, we are so far below His holiness and perfection - how can we even think of being holy and perfect as He is? Yet, we are commanded to be holy and perfect, so somehow it is possible even though it seems impossible in light of our spiritual imperfections. The answer is suggested in Leviticus 22:32 : " I am ADONAI, who makes you holy ... " In other words, we cannot aspire to holiness and perfection in our own power; we have to receive it from God Himself, and realize that for us it is a never-ending goal rather than one that we will achieve during our lifetime. In the Mosaic Covenant, the Israelites pursued holiness through repentance and the prescribed Tabernacle (later Temple) sacrifices. In the New Covenant, we are made holy by being
    one with Yeshua, "the Holy One of Israel". Only through his blood sacrifice can we be made holy and aspire toward perfection, for we read in 1 John 1:9 : If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he [Yeshua] is trustworthy and just, he will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing.'

It is not wrong to seek men''s approval so long as we put God''s approval first: 1 Peter 2:13-14 For the sake of the Lord, submit yourselves to every human authority - whether to the emperor as being supreme, or to governors as being sent by him to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do what is good.'

  commandment: We are to walk in humility and eschew pride.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are some words in the Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah that are sufficiently similar as to warrant explanation. "Humility" and "humbleness" are the same, and refer to persons who do not elevate themselves in their own eyes. "Pride" is the opposite, in that a prideful person attributes self-value, abilities, qualities, and virtues to himself, whereas, even if they truly exist, they are not something he should be bragging about because they were given to him by God. "Haughtiness" and "arrogance" are similar, except that they refer to one''s outward manifestation of pride, whereas pride is largely internal. The reason that humility is lauded and pride is hated by God, is that pride is essentially a rejection of God, and is the sin that was behind Satan''s fall from grace. The sin of pride can manifest in several ways, the most obvious of which results in brash boasting. Motivating such a person is often the delusion that he is a "self-made man", forgetting or
    denying that God is the one who made him, and made him what he is. The opposite, humility, gives credit to God and also to others that have contributed to who we are, and what we have become. There is a more subtle way that pride can manifest. We sometimes come across it in a person that has a sour and complaining disposition, even bordering on self-deprecation. When we encounter it, we sometimes conclude that the person has a low opinion of his self-worth, whereas it is exactly the opposite. Instead of being boastful of his self-worth, such a person turns inward and resents that others do not adequately see it. "I deserved to get that job over my competitor" he might say to himself, or "they never give me credit for how valuable I really am." He may withdraw from social interactions by assuming in advance that he will be rejected, and may justify it by saying to himself something like: "I''m worth more than the way they treat me, so I won''t give them the benefit and pleasure of what
    I have to offer them." Perhaps I should not have to say this, but there is a way that we can experience pride that is not sinful. It is when pleasure is evoked in us by something of quality or by someone doing well, in which we have an interest. An example would be expressing pride in one''s son or daughter who is doing well in school, or in one''s hometown sports team that is winning most of its games. We need to be careful, however, because even such innocuous excursions into pride can cross the line of holy propriety if we begin thinking that our child''s or team''s successes are mainly due to us.'

  commandment: We are to be good stewards of our spiritual gifts, using them according to the grace given us.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: '"Grace", commonly defined as unmerited favor, is both an attribute and a gift that He imparts to us. But for what purpose and how are we to use it? Daniel Juster answers the question this way: Empowered by the Holy Spirit, we are to use our gifts and talents (from the Spirt) as instruments for the blessing and building up of fellow believers in order to reach others for the Good news. In a large sense then, grace is not only unmerited favor, but includes the idea of power to do things. Hence the grace gifts are gifts of power in that the grace of God changes us and gives us ability to live in a right manner and to bless others. One might ask what Scripture means when it says that Yeshua and Stephen were "full of grace and truth." The grace and truth that filled them was not intrinsically their own, but rather that which was placed in them by the Father to benefit others as the Holy Spirit directed. 1 We are to follow their example by being good Stewards of God''s grace
    and other spiritual gifts imparted to us as were they. 1. Although in Yeshua dwelt the fullness of God ( Colossians 1:19, 2:9) , Yeshua became a man like us ( Hebrews 2:14-17 ) and, like us, received his godly attributes (including grace and truth) from His Father in Heaven.'

  commandment: We are not to forsake congregational assembly & fellowship with brother believers.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: God's commandments that we assemble with each other and with Him, are initially given during the time of the Mosaic Covenant. Early in the Covenant, the Tabernacle served as the place of assembly for the Israelites to receive communication from God, to pray, and to perform the commanded sacrifices. The Tabernacle and later the Temple also served as places where the Israelites could assemble with each other (e.g. Joshua 18:1 ), and by the time of Yeshua, the synagogue and individual homes also had become places of communal assembly - mainly for prayer, but also for study and discussion. With the advent of the New Covenant, Jewish and Gentile followers of Yeshua made increased use of their homes for worship, prayer, and fellowship ( Acts 2:46 , 5:42 ), and these home gatherings developed into what eventually became known within Christianity as "home churches", and within Messianic Judaism as "home fellowships", " chavurot " or, when they have elder leadership, "congregations".
    Scripture enjoins believers 1 to be in regular congregational fellowship with one another ( Hebrews 10:24-25 ) as a means of providing mutual spiritual protection and accountability. Being part of a believing community enables us to observe one another's lives, share our burdens, and rebuke and correct one another ( Galatians 6:1 ) in the event that we observe any of us falling into sin or straying from the faith. Congregational community also provides us with leaders (elders) whose responsibility it is to protect the community from outside evil encroachment ( Acts 20:28-29 ), to stop sin when it is observed ( Acts 20:30 ), to bring correction to members of the community, to judge disputes ( Matthew 18:17 ), and to maintain reconciliation among community members ( Luke 17:3 ; Colossians 3:13 ). 1. In this Mitzvah , the term "brother" (applies to both males and females) means either a believer in God the Father and/or in Yeshua the Messiah, according to the context of its use. To the
    classical commentators (Maimonides, Meir, and Hachinuch), "brother" means "fellow Jew".

  commandment: We are to walk in God's ways and adopt them as our own.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: '"Following" God, "imitating" Him, and "walking" in His ways are different ways of saying the same thing - learning God''s ways and adopting them as our own. We see from the above Scriptures that this principle traverses both the Mosaic Covenant and the New Covenant, and that adopting the ways of Yeshua (who is more visible to us than the Father) assures us of adopting the ways of our Father in heaven as well. Yeshua Himself modeled this for us as we read His words in John 5:19 : Therefore, Yeshua said this to them: "Yes, indeed! I tell you that the Son cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does too." There is a common misunderstanding that the Scriptures quoted in this Mitzvah should help dispel; the misunderstanding is that only through the indwelling of the Ru''ach HaKodesh brought by the New Covenant, can men succeed in obeying God. It is wrong because God never holds us accountable for that which
    we cannot do, and Scripture teaches that, at Mt. Sinai, God gave us instructions for conduct that He expected of us. On the other hand, to think that man on his own can accomplish God''s will is wrong also, so what of the Spirit was available to man before the coming of the New Covenant? Since man in his own strength cannot fully accomplish God''s will, it must be that the Holy Spirit was available at Sinai and before, but that the level of the Spirit''s availability was limited and was greatly increased with the coming of the New Covenant. Jeremiah 31:32-33(33-34) partially explains this: "For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra''el after those days," says ADONAI: I will put my Torah within them and write it on their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will any of them teach his fellow community member or his brother, ''Know ADONAI''; for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest; because I will forgive their wickednesses
    and remember their sins no more." Jeremiah prophesies both the Messiah and the Ru''ach HaKodesh - the Messiah to provide a just means for God to forgive our sins, and the Ru''ach to implant God''s very own nature within us in order to bring Him closer and assist us to walk in His ways. Ezekiel 36:24-27 also prophesies a New Covenant in which God would enhance our obedience through the Holy Spirit placed within us, yet God assured us in Deuteronomy 30:11-14 , that we were able to obey Him in pre-Yeshua times as well: For this mitzvah which I am giving you today is not too hard for you, it is not beyond your reach. It isn''t in the sky, so that you need to ask, ''Who will go up into the sky for us, bring it to us and make us hear it, so that we can obey it?'' Likewise, it isn''t beyond the sea, so that you need to ask, ''Who will cross the sea for us, bring it to us and make us hear it, so that we can obey it?'' On the contrary, the word is very close to you - in your mouth, even in your
    heart; therefore, you can do it!'
  classical_commentators: 'Meir and Maimonides agree with each other - that we are to model ourselves after God and expect to become like Him in nature. HaChinuch agrees, and references Micah 7:18 : Who is a God like you, pardoning the sin and overlooking the crimes of the remnant of his heritage? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in grace.'

  commandment: We are to flee from love of money and are to pursue Godly Virtues.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: '"Love of money" is a short way of saying "love of what money can buy". One naturally thinks of money buying goods and services and these alone are enough to ensnare those who are susceptible. However, there is a far greater evil in natural man''s quest for money; it is that money can buy the power of men''s obedience, and preoccupation with power is the opposite of trusting God and submitting to His power. Wanting to be powerful as God was what brought down Lucifer, and the idolatry of it can bring us down as well. The draw of money and what it can buy is so strong, so seductive, that we are commanded to flee from it. Pursuing godly virtues is the opposite of (and the antidote for) pursuing love of money, and is the reason that these two are linked in 1 Timothy 6:10-11 .'
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the Jewish classical commentators.
  commentary_juster: There are some exceptional people who can buy anything they want, but just love to see their financial worth grow and grow; they are in love with it. The Bible does not say that it is wrong to get rich, but rather that one must not be in love with money; money should primarily be used to advance the Kingdom of God by the leading of the Holy Spirit. In Scripture, the standard for acquiring money seems to favor modesty.

  commentary_rudolph: 'Yeshua prayed to his father in heaven: But now, I am coming to you; and I say these things while I am still in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves. I have given them your word, and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world - just as I myself do not belong to the world. I don''t ask you to take them out of the world, but to protect them from the Evil One. They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. Set them apart for holiness by means of the truth - your word is truth. ( John 17:13-17 ) It is God''s will that we remain in the world so that we can bear witness to the lost - those who do not know God, and are in need of Messiah. We are nevertheless warned of a danger to us, which is that if we are not on our guard, we can allow ourselves to be ensnared by the things of the world that appeal to our flesh, and backslide into sin. The things of which we must beware are numerous - money, power,
    possessions, and illicit sex are but examples. We are not, however, left to fend for ourselves, for the Holy Spirit is with us, and we assured that: No temptation has seized you [us] beyond what people normally experience, and God can be trusted not to allow you [us] to be tempted beyond what you [we] can bear. On the contrary, along with the temptation he will also provide the way out, so that you [we] will be able to endure. ( 1 Corinthians 10:13-13 )'

  commandment: We are to be subject to the governing authorities that are established by God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah to be subject to governing authorities is often debated among scholars. We know by the Mitzvah ''s date and context that the governing authorities referred to included those of Rome, so the application of Romans 13:1 today undoubtedly contemplates secular governments on all levels. But how can the Scripture say that all authorities that exist have been established and placed where they are by God, when evil governments such as Nazi Germany are fresh in our minds? Should we have cooperated with Nazi Germany rather than war against her? As absurd as that is, if Romans 13:1 were the only Scripture on the subject, one might come to that conclusion. But let us consider Acts 5:27-29 which seems to say something quite different; it says: They conducted them to the Sanhedrin, where the cohen hagadol demanded of them, "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this [Yeshua''s] name! Look here! you have filled Yerushalayim with your teaching; moreover, you are determined
    to make us responsible for this man''s death!" Kefa and the other emissaries answered, "We must obey God, not men." How do we reconcile Romans 13 with Acts 5 ? Some have attempted to explain Romans 13 by asserting that it refers merely to Rome''s authority to assess and collect taxes. That, in my opinion is wrong. No, I suggest that the answer lies rather in the definition of "authority" - that not all persons and governments that claim to be authorities are, in fact, authorities. Stated differently, an alleged "authority" is not an authority if it is not from God. Any government that willfully commits gross sin or that leads persons for which it is responsible into sin is no authority at all, and we ought to oppose it. With that understanding, we can unhesitatingly say that "we are to be subject to the governing authorities" because true governing authorities are from God.'
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the Jewish classical commentators.

  commandment: We are to give as much attention to being clean of spirit as to being clean of body.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: It is a repeated teaching of Scripture that cleanliness of a man's body is analogized to cleanliness of his spirit. Scripture teaches that both are important, but that cleanliness of spirit is weightier in that if a man's spirit is not clean, no amount of washing with water can cleanse him. A man becomes spiritually clean by submitting himself in obedience to God, repenting of his sins, and receiving Messiah Yeshua as his personal savior. Some of you used to do these things [premarital sex, idol worship, adultery, homosexuality, theft, greed, drunkenness]. But you have cleansed yourselves, you have been set apart for God, you have come to be counted righteous through the power of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and the Spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:11) If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he is trustworthy and just, he will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing. (1 John 1:9)

  commandment: We are to be good stewards of the things and matters that are entrusted to us.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: A steward is someone who cares for things, and "stewardship" is the conducting, overseeing, or managing of things. The "things" may be tangible property, or intangible items such as time, knowledge, skill, etc. The diverse Scriptures presented are representative of others and make a strong case for God wanting us to be good stewards of the things He has entrusted to us. They may belong to others, to God, or even to ourselves, but whether big or small, God holds us accountable for those with which we have been entrusted.
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the classical commentators.
  commentary_juster: Good stewardship is implied by the very idea of being created in the Image of God. We are vice regents, and are called to govern wisely as God's representative rulers.

  commandment: We are to keep & not delay our vows that we make to God.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: A vow is a promise uttered with deliberate solemnity and it is clear from the Scriptures cited above that vows to God may not be broken. There would be nothing more to say on the matter were it not for the annual musical recitation (in most synagogues) of Kol Nidre , rendered just before sundown on the evening of Yom Kippur . Kol Nidre (Sephardic pronunciation Kal Nidre ) means "all vows", and is an ancient Aramaic legal formula that seeks to nullify all vows made to God, by individuals, in the year past and in the year to come. As such, it is a clear and direct violation of the intent of Scripture, and many attempts have been made, over the years, to expunge the tradition from Jewish practice. Some have sought to justify Kol Nidre by inferring that it originated with the "Marranos" during the Spanish Inquisition, in their attempt to nullify vows of conversion to Christianity made under extreme duress. Although the "Marranos" no doubt used the Kol Nidre formula for
    that purpose, the concept originated at least five hundred years earlier. We know this because a similar formula appears in the prayer book of the noted Rabbi Amram Gaon (ca. ninth century). The controversy persists within Judaism broadly, but is a settled matter in most Messianic Jewish congregations where Kol Nidre is either not sung at all, or is replaced by a proclamation of the opposite - a statement affirming all vows made in the year past, and our intention to abide by all vows that we may make in the year to come. I will say only a few words about Nazirite vows since they are rare today. They are vows of special personal dedication to holiness that incorporate limitations on one's lifestyle (e.g. wine and grapes may not be eaten, and one's hair must not be cut), and have a declared date of expiration. I mention them in connection with this Mitzvah because they must, as with other vows, be kept once made notwithstanding our being in the New Covenant.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote four mitzvot related to the keeping of promises (without delay) made with or without vows.

  commandment: We are to swear oaths only in God's name.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: A vow is a promise uttered with deliberate solemnity. An oath is an utterance added to a vow that invokes an authority capable of enforcing the vow, and punishing the oath-maker if the vow is breached. When a person adds an oath to his vow, he is giving an assurance that is in addition to his personal honor. He is essentially saying that if he reneges on his promise, he invites the invoked authority to enforce his compliance and/or mete out punishment. It is clear from many Scriptures in the Tanakh (e.g. Deuteronomy 10:20 ) that God endorses the swearing of oaths, but in His Name alone. That makes perfect sense since if a vow is serious enough to require the added assurance of an oath, no authority other than God can be counted upon to enforce it ( Deuteronomy 6:13-15 ). Also, when we swear an oath by God's Name we invoke His Honor; therefore, if we swear falsely we profane His Name ( Leviticus 19:12 ). The Tanakh contains many examples of oaths sworn in ancient times,
    and even God has been known to swear an oath on occasion (e.g. Hebrews 6:13-17 ). In more recent times, oaths are most commonly sworn ancillary to giving legal testimony in a court of law. When oaths are sworn outside of a court proceeding they are called "notarizations", and are generally for attesting to the accuracy of a legal document or for affirming the authenticity of a signature. There are some who refuse to swear oaths based on their interpretation of Matthew 5:34 and James 5:12 that contain the words " But I tell you not to swear at all ... " and " Above all, brothers, stop swearing oaths ... " respectively. Their explanation for how this can be in light of God's teaching and the many examples in the Tanakh , is that Yeshua changed the rules for the New Covenant in order to raise the standard of truth-telling to a higher level. That is not correct for, if one looks at the Matthew and James "statements" that were taken out of context, when each one's entire verse and adjacent
    verses are returned to them, one sees that there is no contradiction at all. In fact, Matthew 5:33-37 affirms the importance and legitimacy of oaths made in God's Name by warning that we should not swear by "heaven", by "earth", by "Jerusalem", by one's "head" or, by extension, by anything else that is not "God". Similarly, James 5:12 admonishes the reader to stop swearing oaths by "heaven", by "earth", or by "any other formula". These verses of Scripture are apparently intended to stop a common practice of invoking meaningless authorities for their effect in enhancing the oath-taker's appearance that he is telling the truth (when he would never promise the same thing if he was swearing in God's Name). Instead, a man should be able to put forth his reputation that his "yes" and his "no" (i.e. whatever he says) can be relied upon without reinforcement. The Scriptures prohibit using God's Name lightly ( Exodus 20:7 ), but do not, in any way, prohibit swearing oaths in God's Name in appropriate
    situations. Matthew 23:16-24 explains this especially well, and infers a warning to the oath-taker that he deludes himself if he thinks that his oath is not binding just because it does not invoke God's Name directly. Yeshua scolds the teachers and Pharisees for using "oath formulas" that create the appearance of enforceability, while their secret intent is to not honor their vows. It is intentional casuistry, and they will be held to their word by God nevertheless.
  classical_commentators: The corresponding mitzvot of Maimonides and HaChinuch are completely consistent with this Mitzvah , and emphasize that we must not swear an oath by anything that is created. Maimonides adds to this by saying that if we swear an oath by any created object in the belief that it has, in itself, sufficient truth to support the oath, we have put that created object on an equal footing with the Creator, which is sin. There is no mitzvah written on the subject by Meir.

  commandment: We are not to use God's Name lightly or falsely.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Exodus 20:7 is best known for it being the third of the "Ten Commandments", rendered in the King James Version as: Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. This translation and others like it, causes many to think that the Commandment is only about improperly invoking God''s name in the course of communicating verbally (e.g. cussing). That would mean not using the word "God", or one of his proper names, or "Yeshua", or " Ruach HaKodesh " in profane, disrespectful, or trivial expressions, either orally or in writing. 1 Doing so is indeed an obvious prohibition, but one less frequently talked about is profaning God''s Name by conducting our lives sinfully while, at the same time, professing to be a believer. Two common sayings (not in the Bible) apply here; "It is not so much what we say as what we do", and "Actions speak louder than words." It is the responsibility of all those who
    profess belief in God (and Yeshua) to represent God properly by conducting their lives in a holy manner. This responsibility falls especially on Jews (even Jews who do not profess belief in God) because the Jews are widely considered to be "God''s chosen people", and are therefore seen as representing God in all that they say and do. Sinful conduct by a Jew or a Gentile believer in God brings discredit, shame, and disgrace to His Name. Virtuous and holy conduct, on the other hand, brings Him honor and glory. Another and more obvious way of violating this Mitzvah is by prophesying in God''s Name falsely. The most common way of prophesying falsely is by declaring that God said something that He did not in fact say. A false prophecy can result from an innocent mistake or from an intentional deception, and it is not always preceded by a stylized announcement such as "Thus says the Lord." A prophecy is a serious declaration because anyone who hears it and believes that it originates with
    God is duty-bound to act on it or to conform his or her life to it. So, if an alleged prophecy is false (i.e. did not originate with God), it is capable of causing considerable damage, including to the reputation of prophetic words in general. That is why we must test all prophecies against Scripture, and exercise spiritual discernment through prayer. So serious was false prophecy considered under the Mosaic Covenant and Mosaic Law, that prophets who prophesied falsely were put to death ( Deuteronomy 18:20 ). This "zero tolerance" standard was demanded because, in those days, only certain persons called "prophets" were given the Ruach HaKodesh , so all of Israel was dependent upon them for their communication with God. That is not the case today in the New Covenant, however, because today the Ruach HaKodesh is available to all believers in Yeshua, and therefore, to one extent or another, all believers are able to hear God and prophesy. 1. Orthodox Jewish tradition seeks to respect God''s
    Name by making substitutions when writing or speaking of Him. Examples are substituting "G-d" for "God" in writing, or using substitute words (e.g. Hashem ) or manufactured words (e.g. Adoshem and Elokeynu ) in the course of ordinary speech.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch do not cite or refer to the third of the "Ten Commandments" ( Exodus 20:7 ), nor do they write about improperly using God''s name lightly. 2 They do, however, cite Leviticus 22:32 that warns against desecrating or profaning the Divine Name which, they say, is a very serious sin - especially if committed in public. HaChinuch echoes Maimonides on this, and Maimonides goes further to give some specific examples, through which it is clear that he agrees with the premise of this Mitzvah , that swearing by God''s Name falsely or engaging in sinful conduct, even without mentioning God''s Name, violates Leviticus 22:32 . He says that this is especially so if it is committed by a person of known or presumed piety. Meir refers to the sin of conspicuously profaning or desecrating the Name of God (including when one is coerced to change his religion) as chillul HaShem 3 , and says that a man must even surrender to death rather than commit this
    sin. He says that even the power of repenting on Yom Kippur is not enough to atone for chillul Hashem , and therefore the sin remains with the offender for his entire life. 4 Prophesying falsely is another way that God''s name can be used wrongfully. Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote mitzvot (RN27, MN175, and C517, respectively) codifying Deuteronomy 18:20 , that says it is an offense punishable by death for a prophet to prophesy falsely. Maimonides and HaChinuch point out that the offense is not dependent upon whether the prophet''s statement is true, but whether God actually told the prophet to speak it. So, for example, if God gave a word of truth to a first prophet, a second prophet to which the word was not given would be in violation were he to invoke God''s Name in speaking the same word. All the classical commentators agree that the false prophet should, according to the Mosaic Law, be put to death by strangulation. Maimonides and HaChinuch (but not Meir) wrote related
    mitzvot (RN29 and C519, respectively) that seek to interpret Deuteronomy 18:22 . Maimonides states that we are forbidden to take pity on a false prophet or, out of fear, neglect to put him to death. HaChinuch says the same, and adds that the fear spoken of in the Scripture is fear of our being punished for conducting the execution of a prophet. That notwithstanding, verse 22 alludes neither to executing false prophets, nor to our being punished for it; it merely says that we have nothing to fear from the false prophet. 2. Although Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch do not reference Exodus 20:7 in any of their mitzvot , they do warn against speaking God''s Name in vain in RP4, MP4, and C432 respectively (See Mitzvah # G6 of this compilation). 3. Public or conspicuous misbehavior that discredits or disgraces Gods''s Name. 4. Suggestive of Matthew 12:31-32 .'
  commentary_juster: I would say in addition, that the most foundational meaning of the third of the "Ten Commandments" is to not swear an oath in God's Name and then fail to perform it (hence "in vain"). However, all Jewish and Christian commentators also see the broader meanings as brought out in their commentaries and in this Mitzvah .

  commandment: We are to confess and repent of our sins, and make restitution where possible and appropriate.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: It is the general rule that we are to confess our sins, repent, and make restitution. Confession is always to God but, according to James 5:16 , we are also to confess our sins to one another. Confession alone is not adequate, however, and we are commanded to repent as well. Repentance involves regretting that we sinned, and soberly determining to not repeat the sin. A common definition of repentance is "turning away from sin and turning toward God." Not all sins are of the kind that the making of restitution is wise, reasonable, or even possible. For that reason, we must rely on the Ru'ach Hakodesh to know if, when, and how repentance should be made. Regret and repentance, on the other hand, should always occur immediately upon realizing that we have sinned. Matthew 5:23-24 requires that when we sin against a brother we are to go to him, confess, repent, and attempt to reconcile. Even if we do not think we have sinned but our brother does, we should go to him and try
    to reconcile. Although Scripture is not explicit on this point, it would seem that we should do so even if the one we sinned against is not a brother, but an unbeliever. When that is not possible or appropriate, Scripture still requires that we confess our sins to God and to one another, meaning to mature brothers and sisters in the faith who will hear us.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch state that we are to confess our sins and repent, but they do not indicate to whom the confession should be given. Maimonides specifically requires that the confession must be given orally. The others do not specifically say that, but imply it through their use of the word "say" (translated of course). All three commentators reference the fast of repentance on Yom Kippur . Maimonides and HaChinuch reference the commandment in Leviticus 4:27-29 to make a sin offering after one sins, while Meir is silent on the matter.
  commentary_juster: Laws of restitution such as referred to in these passages were intended to guide the civil courts in ancient Israel. As such, the idea of paying damages beyond just restoring what was stolen has become part of most Western law systems; the civil laws in the Bible greatly influenced the legal systems of the west. On a personal level, the person who repents should restore what can be restored and, beyond that, should restore even more as the biblical texts suggest. This is so that the pain of the violation is felt by the one who has sinned, and is mitigated somewhat by the one who has been sinned against. The amounts of restitution specified in the Scriptures can guide personal acts of restitution as well as those of the civil courts. When personal restitution takes place, court actions can be avoided, keeping in mind that 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 prohibits a believer from suing a fellow believer in a secular court.

  commandment: We are not to fear, worry or be anxious, but rather put our trust in God.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are three kinds of fear that are recognized in the Scriptures. The first kind (exemplified by "fear of God and parents") has to do with having profound respect (reverence), and is appropriate - even commanded in those and similar applications. The second kind (also appropriate) is the kind that is built into us by God, in order to protect us from imminent danger. Examples of this kind of fear are our ducking for cover upon being startled by a loud discharge, and our holding back from touching a hot object after having been previously burned by it. The third kind, the one that the Scriptures command against, is the kind where we seek to protect ourselves in circumstances where we ought instead to be relying on God. This kind is exemplified by fear of man and of unwanted circumstances (e.g. death). We sometimes think of fear as a feeling, and indeed there is a physiological component to it. However, God does not command us regarding feelings, but rather regarding
    the choices that we make (in faith) in spite of our feelings. That is the teaching of 2 Corinthians 5:7 : ... for we live by trust, not by what we see. (rendered in the New King James: For we walk by faith, not by sight. ) The Greek word for "sight" in this Scripture is (pronounced " aye-dos "), and refers not only to eyesight, but to all of our senses, including those that imbue us with feelings. Fear, worry, and anxiety are similar in that they are the opposite of trusting God for our welfare and protection. All three are debilitating and open us to spiritual attack, and that is why there are so many Scriptures (in both the Tanakh and the Kitvey B''rit Chadasha ) that warn us against giving in to fear, and exhort us to have faith instead.'
  classical_commentators: The mitzvot of Maimonides and HaChinuch address only three kinds of fear - the reverent kind (not addressed in this Mitzvah ), fear of idolaters, and fear (by a judge) of a party to a lawsuit. Meir addresses only reverent fear and a judge's fear.

  commandment: We are not to swear to that which we know is not true.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: Swearing, in the context of this mitzvah , is invoking the Name of God in order to add a weight of truth to that which is spoken. Swearing can be formal (such as in a court of law), in which case swearing falsely is known as "perjury", and one can be punished by the court for committing it. Swearing can also be informal such as when one makes a comment on the spur of the moment and adds an oath to the comment as a way of attempting to assure its truth. In either case, the Scriptures that underlay this Mitzvah make it clear that one must never swear to that which is untrue.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch take great pains to employ three Scriptures ( Exodus 20:7 , Leviticus 5:22(6:3) , and Leviticus 19:11-12 ) and many words of explanation in order to produce three mitzvot from what is essentially the same. Maimonides distinguishes two of them by emphasizing a shebuat bittui (verbal oath) from a shebuat shav (false oath), from an oath made to repudiate a debt, and the other two commentators do similarly using various indicators of distinction, and they distinguish the third Scripture by its reference to theft.

  commandment: We are to lend money to our brother, sufficient for his need and without regard for the Sabbatical Year. In such a loan, interest must not be charged nor given, and brothers are to take no part whatsoever in interest-bearing loans involving other brothers.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah touches a number of principles, as can be seen from the large number of Scriptures and mitzvot of Meir, Maimonides, and Chinuch that are involved. It affirmatively requires that we lend money to our brother if he is in need, and to not charge him interest on the loan. Although historically commanded only to Israelites concerning their lending money to other Israelites, strangers, and sojourners who are in need, this Mitzvah to lend without interest applies in the New Covenant to all who are our brothers in Yeshua regardless of whether they are Jews or Gentiles. While we have no obligation under this Mitzvah to lend money to persons other than brothers, if we do lend money to other poor or needy persons, this Mitzvah strongly suggests that, out of compassion for their poverty, we not charge them interest either. Also, this Mitzvah 's reference to the Sabbatical Year warns us that we must not decline to lend money to needy brothers prior to the Sabbatical
    Year, even though the debt will be legally discharged and may never be repaid. It should also be noted that Deuteronomy 15:7 (referenced above) implies an obligation to give charity ( tz'dakah ) as well as to loan, and Exodus 22:24(25) not only prohibits being a usurer of the needy, but also participating in it as a borrower (even as a needy borrower), a surety, a witness, or in any other way. Luke 6:34-36 tells us that if we loan money to someone (presumably someone in need), we ought not to expect anything in return; rather, our loan should be motivated by compassion and not by the hope of profiting from the transaction either directly or indirectly. In my opinion, several English translations of the Scripture (including the CJB) render verse 34 incorrectly by suggesting that the lender should not expect the loan itself to be repaid. Not only is such a notion inconsistent with other Scriptures, it contradicts the very nature and definition of a loan as distinguished from a gift. Deuteronomy
    23:21(20) does not apply to loans made to needy persons; we know this because it allows an Israelite to charge interest to a stranger, whereas Leviticus 25:35 prohibits it if the stranger is poor. Nevertheless, it is included here because it indicates that an Israelite brother may not charge interest to another Israelite, even in the case of a general loan, e.g. a business loan. This is in direct conflict with the modern-day practice of charging interest for commercial loans, mortgages, and credit cards. It is possible that, in this anonymous, mixed, and credit-dependant society, this prohibition is no longer applicable because it would prohibit Jews from becoming bankers of any kind, and would prevent Jews from borrowing for business and from acquiring mortgages from banks whose officers were Jewish.
  classical_commentators: Regarding Deuteronomy 23:20(19) , HaChinuch states that, not only are we not to lend money at interest to a brother, but we are not to borrow money at interest from a brother either, thereby making it clear that the lender in such a transaction is not the only guilty party. It is also noteworthy that Meir's mitzvot limit this obligation to lending to Jews, while Maimonides' mitzvah does not contain this limitation; Meir states that his mitzvah (MP62) is greater and more of an obligation than mere charity. It is also noteworthy that other mitzvot deal differently with lending money in circumstances that do not involve poverty. Chill (p 85) references the three-year tithe ( Deuteronomy 14:28 ) because it is used for the needy. He also references Deuteronomy 15:3 (Maimonides RP142) that allows an Israelite to charge interest to a Gentile on a loan as well as Exodus 22:24(25) (RN234). It is noteworthy that this is part of a whole genus of laws that provide a humane
    and protective society - a society that does not reward laziness, but helps those in genuine need and leads to a gracious caring for one another. It is related to the more clearly social welfare rules to be discussed in other mitzvot , such as a planter providing for the poor by not harvesting the corners of his corn field, not double-thrashing olive trees, and not picking up fallen fruit from other trees. A biblically humane society does have a welfare component, though it may not be in redistribution of wealth; that is a big debate. What is clear is that it has rules that foster widespread charity and responsibility for oneself, one's family, and others.

  commandment: We are to return an item we are holding in pledge when the owner is in need of it.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: Although historically commanded to Israelites concerning lending money to (and taking security from) other Israelites, compassion suggests that this Mitzvah be applied to everyone. It in fact raises the question of whether it is proper, in the first place, to take possession of any pledged object which is likely to be needed in the future. In modern times, it is unlikely that a person who is not in the pawn business will take security of chattel for a loan, and it is even less likely that chattel security would involve clothing. Yet, there might be a moral analogy if one takes possession of an item such as a person's tools if the tools are needed by him to earn a living.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides presents a more literal interpretation, requiring the pledged item to be returned during the day or night as needed. "Need", in this context, is on the level of survival, protection, earning capacity, health, and basic comfort. HaChinuch is consistent with Maimonides and Meir.

  commandment: We may eat of crops with which we work, but not take any of it away, nor take to excess. If we lack a basic human need and our work involves providing it to others, we may partake of the product or service of our labor within the limits of survival but not of luxury.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is a form of charity known in the Jewish world as tz'dakah . It speaks to the worker directly, but implies a clear duty on the part of the owner of crops to allow his workers to eat of them while they are at work. One may argue that this also applies to those who work among food items which are not crops. For example, a restaurant worker may eat his fill during his or her work shift, but may not take any of it home. Also, because the Mitzvah is clearly one of compassion for the poor, in modern times it extends to industries that provide human necessaries other than edibles such as medical care, medicine, clothing basics, and fuel. It seems to me that if one hires an unshod shoe salesman, it is inhumane and a violation of 1 John 3:17 to require that he sell shoes while not equipping him with a pair of his own.
  classical_commentators: HaChinuch says that the root of mitzvah C576 is that Israelites are to have good character and exhibit good will. He is in basic agreement with Maimonides and Meir, and all three are very detailed regarding situations and exceptions. 1. Permission to eat at the end of work is a Talmudic interpretation.

  commandment: We are to give tz'dakah to the poor among us.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: Charity, in the Jewish world, is known as tz'dakah . The first thing to notice about the Scriptures that underlie this commandment is that they do not limit tz'dakah to giving for, as you can see in Deuteronomy 15:8 and Leviticus 25:36 , lending to the poor without charging interest is considered a work of tz'dakah as well. Leviticus 25:35 begins by referring to "a member of your people", and charges us with a duty to help our brother Israelite so that he (and presumably his family) can continue to live among us, meaning whatever style of living is par in our community. A charitable burden such as this cannot be complied with by the average person or family, so it is reasonable that the Scripture intends a considerable part of it to be fulfilled communally. Also, although the term "your people" meant fellow Israelites, for us the commandment should be broadened to mean fellow Jews (be we Jewish), and fellow brothers in Messiah, be we Jews or not. The heart of the commandment
    is that God wants us to take responsibility for our impoverished brother's welfare and, in order to be able to do so, our communities must establish some level of financial safety net for its members. If we do not, brothers on whom hard times fall will have to move away from the community, and the inevitable result is fractured relationships, which is not God's intent. The possibility of emergency and sometimes long-term needs developing within any congregational community suggests the wisdom of the community establishing a benevolence fund; administering such a fund, as well as coordinating other resources (both congregational and personal), is one of the important functions of a deaconate ( shamashim ). Besides the corporate measures I spoke of, the Scriptures I mentioned suggest that we have personal responsibility as well. For that reason, we ought to develop a plan for giving charity that includes setting aside funds, and opening our homes with which HaShem has blessed us, to provide
    emergency sheltering when needed. The degree to which we must funds and resources from our own families in order to give to others is not clear from the Scriptures, so we must pray for the Holy Spirit to give us guidance before (and certainly when) the need to give occurs. Another thing to notice in the Scriptures is that Leviticus 25:35 implies that we are also to give tz'dakah to those who we do not count as brothers, for it says " ... you are to assist him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident. " The way this is put is interesting because it suggests that we would have no question or hesitation in helping the foreigner, whereas we need a commandment to motivate us to help those closer to us. Could it be that we sometimes have less compassion for our family and peers than we do for strangers? Our obligation to a give to others in need is carried over to the New Covenant Scriptures with such strength that it might as well have been presented as a commandment there as well.
    1 John 3:17 equates withholding tz'dakah from our brother with our not loving God, and James 2:14-17 tells us that our charitable acts are an indication of the level of our faith. Luke 6:38 is interesting in its application of sowing and reaping, but I prefer to not think in those terms because I do not want to taint any charitable act on my part with even a fleeting thought of self-interest. In addition to it being required by Torah , giving tz'dakah is a time-honored practice in Jewish homes where a tz'dakah box for spare coins is often in plain view. It is further my opinion that giving tz'dakah should always be over and above other giving that is required of us, including our tithes and other offerings.
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides warns us against giving tz''dakah as a way of benefiting ourselves and suggests that, where possible, it ought to be given anonymously. Meir has a great deal to say about tz''dakah that is very motivating. For starters, he makes the statement: "We are duty-bound to be more careful about the mitzvah of charity than about all the other positive commandments" 1 . He goes on to say that "charity is a distinguishing characteristic of the descendants of Abraham" 2 , and that the "faith of truth" and charity are inseparably linked. Maimonides construes the commandment as our being responsible to give tz''dakah to humanity broadly, while Meir is more explicit in applying it to Jews. HaChinuch tells us that one of the values of giving tz''dakah anonymously us to not embarrass the recipient, and suggests that if a needy person is reluctant to receive it as a gift, he might, nevertheless, receive it as a loan. He also opines that even a poor man is obligated to
    give tz''dakah , and reminds us that even a normally wealthy man can fall on hard times financially due to illness and other causes, and may need temporary help, possibly in the way of a loan. 1.

  commandment: We are to set aside and give a part of our increase to the poor.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The requirement that God's people give to the poor ( tz'dakah ) is found throughout the Bible. At the time of Moses, Israel was an agrarian society, so a major way of providing for the poor was by leaving a portion of each field and vineyard un-harvested and by not picking up grapes or grain that fell to the ground. By the time of Yeshua, Israel was still agricultural but was already moving toward using money for tz'dakah . Today, most of the world's population does not live in a farm environment, and wages paid in money has largely replaced being paid in produce and goods. Nevertheless, the principle of the Mosaic commandments to set aside a part of our increase for the poor is still God's will. The first Corinthian Scripture cited above makes mention of setting aside money for the Apostle Sha'ul to bring to God's people in Jerusalem. In addition to it being required by Torah , giving tz'dakah is a time-honored practice in Jewish homes where a tz'dakah box for spare
    coins is often in plain view. It is my opinion that tz'dakah should always be in addition to other giving that is required of us such as our tithes and other offerings, and it should be noted that, according to Torah , part of the tithe must also be set aside for the poor.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides', Meir's, and HaChinuch's respective mitzvot are entirely from the perspective of agriculture in the Land of Israel.

  commandment: (a) The gleanings and part of every harvest & vintage must be left for the poor & disadvantaged.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: In ancient Israel, the life-sustaining commodities were foods grown in the soil, typically grains and grapes. God's commandments to leave the gleanings and reserve a part of the fields and vineyards for the poor and the foreigner were part of His larger plan to provide for those who could not otherwise live (e.g. Ruth 2:2 ). It is instructive that no such commandments were given regarding herds, flocks, manufactured goods, and artisans' services other than the left-over of certain animal offerings to be given to the Levites. My conclusion, therefore, is that these commandments were not intended to impute broad moral responsibility to the owners of all industries and commodities; their purpose was solely tz'dakah . Although the Scriptures heretofore presented have diminished applicability in today's industrial and technical world, they must be complied with literally in agricultural environments where they can be applied. There are also wider applications of the Scriptures
    that should be considered by those of us who produce or provide life-sustaining (or even life-enhancing) products and services of a non-agricultural nature, and are moved to comply with the spirit of what God sought to achieve in ancient Israel. In such cases, part of our production (be they goods or services) can be identified and set apart as tz'dakah (over and above our other requirements to give tz'dakah ), and the items themselves or profits therefrom can be given to the poor and disadvantaged. 1 Setting aside food and clothing in food banks and humanitarian aid centers is very much in keeping with this concept, and a goodly number of synagogues and churches participate in this kind of charitable giving. Another opportunity for applying this Mitzvah occurs when we inadvertently produce defective but usable products. When that happens, instead of discarding them or selling them at a discount for our own gain, we could donate the irregular items or the proceeds of their sale to the
    poor and disadvantaged. Examples of such items are blemished fruits, irregularly sewn garments, unevenly cut building materials, discolored fabrics, and dented appliances. The original agricultural commandments stand unchanged and are mandatory, whereas this broader mitzvah is optional but recommended for prayerful resolution. 1. In ancient Israel, foreigners were protected by God's Commandments because they were disadvantaged, as were widows and orphans.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret the Scriptures of this Mitzvah as applying only to agriculture, and Meir (not Maimonides or HaChinuck) considers them applicable only in Eretz Yisrael .

  commandment: We are to deal fairly and honestly in business.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah consolidates a number of God's mitzvot into the single principle that we are to deal fairly and honestly when transacting business with our neighbors; it applies equally to the buyer and to the seller of both goods and services. The buyer must not defraud a seller by purchasing an item which he knows (or suspects) is under-priced in error. Likewise, a seller must not sell an item whose condition and value do not justify its price. Error in price is only one of several kinds of errors which can be made. It is possible that either the buyer or the seller could err in the identity, condition, or usability of an item. If an error is made and discovered within a reasonable time by either party, it should be called to the other party's attention, and an adjustment should be negotiated to meet Scripture's requirement of fairness. In an ethical sale, nothing is concealed, there is full disclosure, and both parties act willingly and without coercion. This is in
    partial contrast with the British and American Common-law which does not countenance fraud, but embraces the principle of Caveat Emptor - "Let the buyer beware!" Intentionally using inaccurate weights and measures in a transaction of buying or selling is, of course, dishonest and sinful. However, it can also be accidental, so Scripture prohibits even possessing weights and measures that are inaccurate. To make the point graphic, Maimonides states that one cannot possess an inaccurate measuring vessel, even if it is only used to collect urine.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides draws on the Oral Tradition to say that one-sixth of the fair price is the amount that an item can be overcharged or undercharged without either side having recourse. It is noteworthy that Maimonides' mitzvah RN253 commands that we are not to wrong a proselyte (convert to Judaism) in matters of business. He derives this from Exodus 22:20(21) , which refers neither to conversion nor business. Meir and HaChinuch follow Maimonides' reasoning, but broaden their respective statements to include all matters involving monetary value.

  commandment: We are to pay an employee his wages on the same day that he labors or when contractually due.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The essence of this Mitzvah is that we must not oppress an employee by withholding or delaying payment of his wages. There are many kinds of employees today in many occupations. Some are day laborers and some are poor and some are not. It is customary to pay a hired man or employee at the end of a specified period of time that may be daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or at the conclusion of a contract, so this Mitzvah should not be interpreted to require that all workers be paid daily. That having been said, Deuteronomy 24:14-15 requires that an employer pay a hired man daily if the man's impoverished condition makes it reasonable and compassionate to do so. The inference of Deuteronomy 14 is that not paying wages to a poor worker in a timely manner is akin to exploiting him, and there are undoubtedly unscrupulous employers who would withhold or delay the payment of wages to a poor worker in order to pressure the worker into giving the employer some kind of advantage.
    This Mitzvah can, therefore, be construed to have a broader meaning, which is to not exploit an employee's weakness to gain advantage.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch advocate literal compliance with the referenced Scriptures.

  commandment: We are to cancel all loans (that were made to brothers) in the Sabbatical Year, and we are not to refuse giving a loan to a poor brother due] to the Sabbatical Year being near.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Sabbatical Year is known as the "Year of Release" ( Sh''mittah ) because loans made to Israelites, by Israelites, are cancelled every seventh year. Also, Israelites are prohibited from denying loans to needy brothers when the Sabbatical Year approaches, despite the possibility that the loan will be discharged and not repaid voluntarily. The release of such loans does not (according to Deuteronomy 15:3 ) apply to - foreigners. I believe that one of the reasons God gave Israel the Sabbatical Year was to test well-to-do Israelites'' faith and reliance on Him. A question that naturally comes to mind is how releasing loans in the Sabbatical Year applies today in the New Covenant. I am of the opinion that it continues to apply where the circumstances are similar to those of ancient Israel, and that it applies not only to Jews but also to K''rov Yisrael Gentiles; how similar the circumstances need to be will be revealed by the Ruach HaKodesh as we pray for guidance. As
    for other non-Jewish followers of Yeshua, I am inclined to the position that as New Covenant brothers, literal compliance is a blessing for them but not a requirement; I partially draw this conclusion from Isaiah 56:1-7 , which promises blessing to the foreigner who keeps Gods Sabbaths, but does not require it of them (although admittedly most Sabbaths do not involve the release of debts). One thing that is certain, however, is that God continues to expect all of us to look to Him for provision rather than to think that we can cause provision to come to us by our own efforts. This Mitzvah has some interesting ramifications in modern times. One of these is that the enforced collection of debts today is generally accomplished through civil courts - not by batei din . Therefore, as a practical matter, there is no way to enforce the Mitzvah against suing a brother in a secular court if a creditor decides to violate it and sue on the debt. Also, because this Mitzvah is so closely connected
    to Jewish life in Eretz Yisrael , it is arguable as to whether it applies among brothers (brother Jews and brothers in Yeshua) in the Diaspora. The weight of rabbinical opinion is that it is valid for Jews everywhere, and it is my opinion that it also applies to Jewish and K''rov Yisrael members of Messianic Jewish communities in the Diaspora if the loans are given with the understanding that observing the Sh''mittah is part of the community''s halachah . It should not be surprising that this Mitzvah is unpopular among creditors and that it has encountered much resistance. During the latter years of the Second Temple, the sage Hillel became concerned by the growing number of Jews whose weak faith was such that they were declining to loan money to poor Jewish brothers when the Sabbatical Year was near. To urge them to do so, he invented a legal procedure that, in effect, circumvented God''s intent in giving the Mitzvah . The procedure, still used today, is known as a Pruzbul , and works
    this way: Some time before Sh''mittah , a lender gives ownership of his uncollected debt to a bet din which, in turn, appoints the lender to collect the debt for the bet din . The debt is not discharged by Sh''mittah because the bet din is a corporate entity, not a Jewish brother, so Deuteronomy 15:2 does not apply. When the lender collects the debt and attempts to give the proceeds to the bet din , he is told that the bet din does not want the money and he is instructed to keep it. I do not agree with using such casuistic ploys to collect debts or, for that matter, to avoid complying with God''s commandments in any other circumstance; I believe it is this kind of thinking that Yeshua was referring to when He said to the Pharisees: Thus, with your tradition which you had handed down to you, you nullify the Word of God! And you do other things like this. ( Mark 7:13 ) Nevertheless, I do not believe there is anything wrong with a lender accepting return of his money after Sh''mittah if
    it is offered voluntarily. The application of this commandment in modern credit societies requires some adjustment that is legitimate. First of all, commercial loans which are used to increase a person''s wealth, purchase mortgages, make investments, etc., are not the intended application of this Mitzvah , although some of these loans are discharged as well. This Mitzvah is meant to apply to loans given by individuals, to individuals, because the borrower (who is a Jewish brother to the lender) is in some kind of personal need. Need-based loans must be given with generosity, and with willingness that the loan will be cancelled on the Sabbatical Year. Modern societies often have something like this in built into their civil laws that is called bankruptcy, where a person who becomes financially insolvent can receive a judicial discharge of his debts; in the United States, this is possible every six years. Bankruptcy laws are the modern alternative to indentured servanthood and Debtor''s
    Prison, and they reflect something of the same spirit as this mitzvah and the Year of Jubilee.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides states that a purpose of the Sh'mittah commandment is to teach kindness to the poor, and he also puts forth the case that it trains us against coveting what our neighbor owns. The logic is that, by not being allowed to recover money he has lent, how much more must the lender keep from coveting what belongs to the borrower. HaChinuch agrees with this kal va-chomer logic. HaChinuch connects complying with Deuteronomy 15:9 (the requirement to lend even with Sh'mittah approaching) with trusting God by citing Proverbs 11:24-25 as God's promise of blessing to those who are generous. The other commentators make no such connection and, in fact, Maimonides exhibits severity toward foreigners by interpreting the permissive language in Deuteronomy 15:3 (" you may demand that a foreigner pay his debt ") into his Mitzvah RP142 which states that we are required to collect debts from heathen with the same zeal as we forgive the debts of Israelites. Meir does not deal
    with the issue at all, but HaChinuch, in his Mitzvah C476, agrees with Maimonides, and says that it is so that an idolater will not profit from an Israelite's generosity and possibly entice the sympathetic Israelite to follow after idolatrous practices. Meir is of the opinion that if a borrower offers return of a loan voluntarily after Sh'mittah , the lender should not accept it. However, if it is offered a second time, then he may.

  commandment: We are not to deal harshly when lending or while collecting debts.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The first thing to notice is that one should not consider himself a creditor when one lends money to a poor brother ( Exodus 24(25) ). Scripture establishes a different standard when the loan is to a brother Jew and especially if it is for compassionate reasons. This is clear in the Scriptures that deny interest to the lender and limit his collection options. Notice also that the lender is to treat the borrower so as to preserve both his safety and dignity, as we see in Deuteronomy 24:10-13 which prohibits the lender from entering the borrower's house to remove collateral, and requires that the lender return needed collateral to him at night. Notice also that importance is given to maintaining the borrower's good relationship with the lender and his having gratitude for the lender's compassion in having concern for his welfare. The lender has no recourse of collection against a brother for a debt which the brother is unable to pay, but such is not the case with a loan
    made to a foreigner. In making a loan to a foreigner, interest may be charged and collection means employed if the loan is defaulted upon. Nevertheless, compassionate justice is due everyone, including the foreigner, so the overall torah of this Mitzvah is that we are not to deal harshly or unreasonably when lending money, or collecting debts from anyone. As with other mitzvot , that date back to the Mosaic period, the foreigner or stranger was the Gentile who was not part of the camp of Israel, and was most likely an idol-worshipper. With the New Covenant, Gentile believers in Yeshua become brothers and members of the commonwealth (national life) of Israel through grafting into the olive tree ( Romans 11:17 ; Ephesians 2:12 ), so this mitzvah and others like it should apply to them as though they are Jews. It is fairly easy to apply this Mitzvah when a loan is made by and individual to an individual. However, in this day and age, many loans are not personal but rather corporate, and
    in such case the Mitzvah is difficult to apply. Consider, for example, the plight of a Jewish bank officer who facilitates his bank's loan to another Jew and, when the loan is defaulted upon, called to foreclose on the borrower's house in order to collect the loan. Since the bank officer does not own the loan and is duty bound to represent his employer's interest, it is my opinion that he can participate in the foreclosure after making every effort to help the borrower solve his financial difficulty.
  classical_commentators: Interestingly, both Maimonides and HaChinuch, in their respective mitzvot , go beyond what Deuteronomy 15:3 and says. They construe these verses as positive commandments requiring that interest be charged to idol-worshippers and that the collection of their debts be pursued rigorously even if means of pressure are required. This is in contrast to the mercy and compassion that is must be shown when dealing similarly with Jews, the logic, expressed by HaChinuch being, that we should not provide idolaters with advantages lest we promote their ways and be drawn into them. Maimonides actually says that is in order to harm them. Meir does not deal with Deuteronomy 15:3 at all, and I do not believe that following Maimonides' and HaChinuch's emphasis of harshness toward unbelievers or even idolaters is in keeping with the New Covenant's commandments that we attempt to lead them to Messiah and win their souls for God.

  commandment: We are to rest, refrain from work, and conduct a holy convocation on the weekly Sabbath.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Sabbath was first described in Genesis 2:2-3 as the seventh day that God rested, and declared holy, following the six days of creation. Later, God commanded the Israelites to keep the Sabbath as a day to rest, refrain from work, and conduct a holy convocation ( Leviticus 23:3 ) 1 . He also made the Sabbath applicable to Gentiles - not as a commandment - but as a source of blessing ( Isaiah 56:1-7 ). My belief is, therefore, that keeping the seventh day Sabbath is law for the Jew, and blessing for the Gentile. Conversely, not to keep the Sabbath is sin for the Jew and a blessing lost for the Gentile. In the New Covenant Scriptures, Hebrews 4:1-11 compares "Sabbath rest" with "spiritual rest" that is received through having faith in Messiah Yeshua; that, of course, is applicable to Jew and non-Jew alike. Since rest is the cessation of work, it is important to know the kind of work that is prohibited on the Sabbath. Exodus 23:12 provides part of the answer, for if
    we are to work six days of the week and rest on the seventh, the work referred to must be ordinary work of the kind we engage in for our livelihood and sustenance 2 . This would seem to mean that, on the Sabbath, carpentry is forbidden for the carpenter and cooking is forbidden for the cook, leaving open the possibility that such activities might be engaged in by persons who do them for pure enjoyment or recreation. Some would say that it is not so, because Isaiah 58:13-14 prohibits our pursuing personal interests on the Sabbath. I do not interpret the Scripture that way; I believe it is warning us away from pursuing interests that are at odds with God's interests and from doing usual things that would detract from making the Sabbath day special. So, for example, if immersing ourselves in outdoor nature adds to our Shabbat shalom , the fact that we find it interesting and pleasurable should not render it a prohibited activity. On the other hand, we should probably not use the Sabbath
    to continue our methodical study of birds that we began earlier in the week (restful though it may be) because then we would not be treating the day as special. Such decisions are personal and should be resolved through communion with the Holy Spirit. I would be remiss were I not to mention that the Rabbinical understanding of what constitutes work includes things that are creative, the reason being that when God rested on the seventh day, He rested from "creating". That is why the rabbis forbid Sabbath activities that include writing and composing. It is also why the Pharisees in the First Century objected to Yeshua healing on the Sabbath (see Luke supra); healing and performing miracles was considered creative, and therefore a violation of the Sabbath (healing to save a life has always been permitted as an exception). Messianic Judaism follows Yeshua's example in desiring to see healings and other miracles occur on the Sabbath, and we therefore have no hesitation in "laying on of hands"
    and praying for healing. Nor do we hesitate to write down godly inspirations we may receive, or do other things to make the Sabbath a delight rather than a burden. When God looked over what He had made, declared it "good" and later rested and gave us a Sabbath of rest as well, He was not supposing that we were engaged in creating things the previous six days and therefore needed to stop. He was summoning us to a day of rest in Him by reflecting on His Creation and affirmatively seeking His power for our restoration. Our position on this is that we may be creative on the Sabbath so long as it is not our usual work, and is an appropriate reflection of Him, and a reminder that we were created in His image. There is a category of ordinary work that is clearly not forbidden on the Sabbath. It is work that is ministerial, because it is analogous to the work of the cohanim who were required to conduct Sabbath sacrifices in the Temple as part of their priestly duties. Modern Judaism is split
    on works of compassion - e.g. works that heal or maintain safety, but there is uniform agreement that working to save a life is permitted. Messianic Judaism, in contrast, follows the example of Yeshua, and considers that works of compassion are not only permitted on the Sabbath, but are encouraged. A rare category of work that is permitted on the Sabbath is work that must be undertaken so as not to violate another commandment of God. Thus a mohel is permitted to circumcise on the eighth day after the birth of a Jewish boy even if it falls on a Shabbat . These exceptions to the Mitzvah are generally accepted within Messianic Judaism and Judaism broadly; other possible exceptions need to be discerned through prayerfully seeking guidance from the Ruach HaKodesh . Abstaining from work on the Sabbath is not only an act of obedience - it is an act of faith for, by so doing, we are trusting God to provide for us. An example of this is found in Exodus 16:22-30 , where the Israelites had to trust
    God to provide them with food during the Shabbat when they were not allowed to gather manna. 1. See also, Isaiah 66:23-24 and Hebrews 10:24-25 . 2. The Orthodox Rabbinical community goes beyond this by adhering to a complex set of rules and a list of prohibited activities that are derived from the Babylonian Talmud ( Shab. 75a )
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides comments very little. HaChinuch states that the underlying meaning of the mitzvah to not work on the Sabbath is to refrain from the work of our normal occupations. In our rest, we are to remember each day of the creation of the world as well as the miracle of Israel''s exodus from Egypt. HaChinuch and Meir state that the sages list 39 activities that are prohibited on the Sabbath ( Shab. 73a ); these are intended as a fence around the Torah . Of the three commentators, Meir is the only one who states that it is forbidden for a Jew to ask a Gentile to do work in his behalf on the Sabbath, and he also states that doing work on the Sabbath is permitted if it is to save a human life. None of the traditional mitzvot addresses the requirement of Leviticus 23:3 that the Sabbath should be a day of "holy convocation". Special mention is made of Maimonides'' RN322 and HaChinuch''s C114, in which they profess that we must not inflict punishment on Shabbat. The
    Scripture upon which they rely is Exodus 35:3 , which states: You are not to kindle a fire in any of your homes on Shabbat. The logic of relying on this seemingly inapplicable Scripture is that one of the ways of punishing according to the Mosaic Law is burning.'
  commentary_juster: 'The issue of Sabbath is paradoxical for Gentiles: The Sabbath, as a day of rest on the seventh day, is never enjoined upon Gentiles in the New Covenant. Rabbinical Judaism defined it as part of Jewish-specific law, and part of God''s Covenant with Israel - not universal law which is required of all people (i.e. the Noachide laws). The Sabbath principle is enjoined upon all, at least as a "rest of faith". ( Hebrews 4:2-11 ). The passages in Isaiah 56 and 66 indicate a more universal observance in the Age to Come than in the Mosaic age. Isaiah 56 may only be referring to Gentiles who are called to live among the Jewish people, but Isaiah 66 may well imply a world-wide Sabbath day. In the light of the passages in Isaiah , it is certainly appropriate for Gentiles to keep one day in seven as unto the Lord when it is practically possible within their cultures (remember that there was no seven day week in the Roman world at the time the N.T. was being written). While it is
    appropriate for Gentiles in Messiah to take the seventh day as their day of rest (and possibly as an eschatological sign of the Age to Come), this does not mean that all Christian Congregations ought to gather for worship on Saturday. Sunday celebrations of the day of Resurrection are certainly appropriate and there is, in this age, a choice to make this the day of rest also, or to add Sabbath rest on the seventh day to the corporate gathering on Sunday, or move the Christian gathering to the seventh day and treat it as a day of rest as well. What is culturally feasible and best is an important factor in the choice, and is within the purview of New Covenant liberty.'

  commandment: We are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread by eating matzah on each of its seven days.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Scriptures cited herein are unambiguous that God commanded the Israelites to eat matzah on each of the seven days of the Feast of unleavened bread that begins on the 15 th day of Nisan . The rationale for it appears to be to remember the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt by eating bread similar to the kind they carried with them - bread that did not have time to rise during their travel. This translates to being a mandate today for Jews and K'rov Yisrael Gentiles, but not for other Gentiles, although they may do so (if they are so moved) in identification with the Jewish people.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch state that we must eat matzah on the evening of the 15 th of Nisan , and Maimonides states that doing so after that is optional. On this latter point, Meir and HaChinuch are silent, and they offer no mitzvah to support eating matzah during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Pesachim 120a in the Talmud appears to be the source of the commentators' apparent belief that there is no commandment to eat matzah after Pesach . Perhaps they understand the Scriptures to be saying that if one chooses to eat bread from the 15 th to the 21 sti of Nisan , then the bread must be unleavened. I do not know their rationale, but I am of opinion that Scripture commands eating matzah on each of the seven days of Unleavened Bread as a daily reminder of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt.

  commandment: On the evening of Passover, we are to ceremonially tell our children that we eat matzah and remove leaven and chametz from our domain as a reminder of what God did for us when we left Egypt.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This ceremony (that we now call a seder ) was commanded for us (Israelites) to do after we emerged from Egypt and entered the Land that the Lord had promised our ancestors. Although Israel's exodus from Egypt occurred many centuries ago, we retell its events in the first person as though "we" (not "they") left Egypt. I believe it is also applicable to Gentiles who permanently live within the Jewish community ( K'rovei Yisrael ) because those whom God brought out of Egypt were a mixed multitude that consisted, not of Jews only, but also of Gentiles ( Exodus 12:38 ). At our modern Passover seder , it is customary for a child to ask four questions, and for us to answer the questions by telling him (or her) the story of when we left Egypt. Through this retelling, we are reminded of God's miracles in our behalf, that He brought us out of Egypt "by the strength of His hand", and that we left in such haste that we brought no leaven with us so the bread we had to eat was un-risen.
    Although our living conditions in the desert were strenuous, God provided for us with manna 1 , quail, water, and shoes that did not wear out. His greatest provision for us, however, was His divine presence, for He accompanied us and guided us through the desert in a column of cloud by day and a column of fire by night. While this Mitzvah to recount Israel's exodus from Egypt is clearly directed to Jews and K'rov Yisrael Gentiles, the remembrance of what God did for Israel should be a joy and encouragement for all believers. All Gentile parents who are believers may therefore want to tell the story of the Exodus, and explain about matzah , leaven, and chametz to their children as well. 1. A flaky sweet-tasting bread sent from heaven - " man " in Hebrew.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch all state that we are to tell about the exodus from Egypt. However, Maimonides and HaChinuch say that we are to tell it on the evening of the 15 th of Nisan , and Meir says it should be told on the night before the 15 th of Nisan . These are probably not disagreements, but rather different ways of referring to the Passover seder event.

  commandment: We are to blow the shofar on the first day of the seventh month, on the other appointed days, on Rosh Chodesh, in the Jubilee, on days of rejoicing, & as an alarm in war.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Hebrew of Leviticus 23:23:24 says that the first day of the seventh month ( Tishrei on the lunar calendar) is a remembrance of blowing ( Zich''ron T''ruah ), and Numbers 29:1 says it is a day of blowing ( Yom T''ruah ); the CJB translation adds the word " shofar " (a trumpet made from an animal horn) because that was what was customarily blown in Moses'' time to draw the community''s attention, to summon to assembly, and to sound alarms. That is why the first day of Tishrei is sometimes referred to as the "Day of Trumpets" ( Yom HaShofar ), and it is a warning to prepare for the Day of Atonement ( Yom Kippur ) that is about to come. It is generally understood that not everyone in the community need blow a shofar ; it is sufficient that the community cause the shofar to be blown in public for all to hear. In the Jewish world, Yom T''ruah is most commonly known as Rosh HaShanah (Head of the Year), and considered the "Day of Judgment" ( Yom HaDin ) when the "Books
    of Life" are opened, and we are called to begin an examination of our lives, with the purpose of repenting of our sins before the "Books" are again closed and sealed, ten days later, on the "Day of Atonement" ( Yom Kippur ). The day is also said, in Talmud , to be the anniversary of the creation of the world. Scripture does not indicate the reason for Yom T''ruah , but its placement 10 days prior to Yom Kippur strongly suggests that it is intended to begin a count-down of days for personal introspection leading to Yom Kippur . This theme is reflected in Mishna Yoma 1 and its related Talmudic Gemara , that explain how the High Priest ( Kohen HaGadol ) was sequestered for purification seven days prior to Yom Kippur ; that process would have begun three days from when the shofar sounded on Yom T''ruah . This time of introspection from Yom T''ruah to Yom Kippur (known as the "Days of Awe" or Yamim Nora''iym ) should be seen as meaningful to all Jews and all followers of Yeshua because, according
    to Exodus 19:6 , Israel is a kingdom of priests (albeit not all of Israel are Levitical priests) and, according to 1 Peter 2:9 and Revelation 5:10 , all New Covenant believers have been made priests as well. Priestly duties require time spent for personal cleansing, so what better use is there of the ten day period from when the trumpets sound to Yom Kippur ? That notwithstanding, literal compliance with this Mitzvah , i.e., to blow the shofar , is mandatory only for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. It is optional for Gentiles generally. It is an interesting side-note that the Babylonian Talmud ( b. Rosh HaShanah 29b ) prohibits the shofar from being blown when Rosh HaShanah falls on a weekly Shabbat. The reason given for this prohibition is to protect the Shabbat from being violated by someone who might inadvertently carry his shofar beyond the prescribed distance. My position is that the Talmudic prohibition is incorrect because it is in direct contradiction of several Scriptures
    that require that the shofar be blown on Yom T''ruah (which, by the way, is itself a Shabbat ). We have said much about blowing the shofar on Yom T''ruah , but Scripture commands that the shofar be blown at other times as well, such as on the other appointed days, on Rosh Chodesh , on days of rejoicing, and as an alarm to war. In this last-mentioned time of blowing we should not limit our understanding of war to just the physical, but also to times of spiritual warfare, especially when declared by our communities'' leaders. We are also to blow the shofar on days of rejoicing, and the contrast of war and rejoicing is something to consider as we ponder complying with 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 : Always be joyful. Pray regularly. In everything give thanks, for this is what God wants from you who are united with the Messiah Yeshua.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch all refer to Yom T'ruah as Rosh HaShanah and state their respective mitzvot as our having to hear the shofar being blown. This no doubt reflects their view (as it is also mine) that blowing the shofar is the responsibility of the community, but going to hear them being blown is the responsibility of each individual. Of the three, HaChinuch is the most expansive in his discussion of Rosh HaShanah . He explains that the Mishnah in Talmud tractate b. Rosh HaShanah 2a considers the 1 st of Tishrei to be the beginning of the year (for numbering the years), and that the blowing (or sounding) was determined, by the sages, to be of the shofar as distinguished from some other musical instrument. He also speaks of " t'ruah " as a broken sound, which he relates to man's need of repentance from sin. HaChinuch states that any hollow animal horn may be blown on Rosh HaShanah , whereas Meir states that only the horn of a sheep is acceptable. They
    both state that it is obligatory to hear nine sounds of the shofar , consisting of t'kiah (a single unwavering sound), t'ruah (a series of short broken sounds), and sh'varim (several short unwavering sounds). They do not refer to a t'kiah g'dolah .
  commentary_juster: I believe that when the New Covenant Scriptures speak of a heavenly shofar being sounded upon Yeshua's return, upon the dead being raised, and upon His disciples (then alive) being transformed and caught up with Him in the air, they are referring to Yom T'ruah ( 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 ; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 ). This can also be connected to an eschatological time of universal repentance, including in Israel ( Zechariah 12:10 ), that leads to a world-wide "Day of Atonement". If so, then the days between Yom T'ruah and Yom Kippur have teaching significance for all followers of Yeshua, and enhanced responsibility for the Jewish People, and for K'rov Yisrael Gentiles, who are charged with fulfilling the commandment to blow and hear the sound of the shofar .

  commandment: We are to afflict our souls, repent of our sins, and adopt Yeshua's death as our atoning sacrifice on Yom Kippur.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The 10 th day of the seventh month is referred to in Leviticus 23:27 and 25:9 as Yom HaKippurim , and in Leviticus 23:28 as Yom Kippurim . Although the day appears in the plural in Scripture, it is more commonly known as Yom Kippur , and is translated "Day of Atonement". Because the CJB translates the above Scriptures differently than do several other highly regarded English translations, I had to decide which of them to rely upon in constructing this Mitzvah . The five Scripture verses at issue are: The CJB and NIV translate the four as "deny yourselves", and the KJV and NKJ translate them as "afflict your souls". The NAS version differs by translating the first three as "humble your souls", and Numbers 29:7 as "humble yourselves". The CJB and NIV both translate Leviticus 23:29 as "deny himself", the KJV translates it as "not be afflicted", the NKJ version translates it as "not afflicted in soul", and the NAS version translates it as "not humble himself". The weight
    of lexical authority appears to favor (and I have adopted) the view that we are commanded to afflict and humble our souls on Yom Kippur . The question is "What does that mean?" and "How are we to accomplish it?" Jewish tradition, based partially upon Scripture (e.g. Psalms 35:13 ; 69:10 ; Jeremiah 36:6 ), interprets "afflict your souls" as meaning that we are to fast from food and drink for twenty-five hours; this fast has become one of Yom Kippur ''s most well-known features. While fasting on Yom Kippur is certainly appropriate and a practice that I heartily endorse, I am of the opinion that THE TRUE BIBLICAL MEANING AND INTENT OF AFFLICTING OUR SOULS ON YOM KIPPUR IS THAT WE REPENT OF OUR SINS. Consider God''s admonition to the Israelites in Isaiah 58:1-8 : Shout out loud! Don''t hold back! Raise your voice like a shofar! Proclaim to my people what rebels they are, to the house of Ya''akov their sins. Oh yes, they seek me day after day and [claim to] delight in knowing my ways. As
    if they were an upright nation that had not abandoned the rulings of their God, they ask me for just rulings and [claim] to take pleasure in closeness to God, [asking,] ''Why should we fast, if you don''t see? Why mortify ourselves, if you don''t notice?'' Here is my answer: when you fast, you go about doing whatever you like, while keeping your laborers hard at work. Your fasts lead to quarreling and fighting, to lashing out with violent blows. On a day like today, fasting like yours will not make your voice heard on high. Is this the sort of fast I want, a day when a person mortifies himself? Is the object to hang your head like a reed and spread sackcloth and ashes under yourself? Is this what you call a fast, a day that pleases ADONAI? Here is the sort of fast I want - releasing those unjustly bound, untying the thongs of the yoke, letting the oppressed go free, breaking every yoke, sharing your food with the hungry, taking the homeless poor into your house, clothing the naked when
    you see them, fulfilling your duty to your kinsmen! Then your light will burst forth like the morning, your new skin will quickly grow over your wound; your righteousness will precede you, and ADONAI''s glory will follow you. The theme and purpose of Yom Kippur is repentance, and the above Scripture eschews any fast (including the Yom Kippur fast) that does not include it. We are familiar with the discomfort of not eating, so fasting might seem to be the primary and most logical way that God wants us to afflict our souls on Yom Kippur . Consider, however, how much more our souls are afflicted by our having to face the reality of our sins and repent, often with confession and restitution. Although afflicting our souls is called for, what is really sought from us is not bodily discomfort but repentance. Observance of Yom Kippur as a Shabbat and time for personal repentance is mandatory for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles, and recommended for other Gentile followers of Yeshua as well.
    Not only is repentance important for us personally, but it is necessary if we are to fulfill the priestly responsibilities that God has given to each of us. According to Exodus 19:6 , Israel has been made into a kingdom of priests (albeit not all of Israel are descended from Levitical priests) and, according to 1 Peter 2:9 and Revelation 5:10 , all New Covenant believers have become priests as well. This "priesthood of believers" is not for the purpose of sacrificing animals in an earthly temple, but for serving Yeshua who, as High Priest, entered the heavenly "Holy Place" by means of His own blood sacrifice ( Hebrews 9:11-12 ). So whether we are Jews or Gentiles, all disciples of Yeshua carry priestly responsibilities for which spiritual cleansing through repentance is a prerequisite. Note also that, whereas animal sacrifices (accompanied by repentance) conducted in the Temple merely covered over sins, Yeshua''s sacrifice (accompanied by repentance) in the New Covenant completely removes
    sin.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch express their respective mitzvot as our having to fast on Yom Kippur . They deduce this from the above Scriptures which they understand to be saying "We must afflict our souls". This Mitzvah agrees with them on that latter point, but does not agree that afflicting the soul necessarily equates to fasting. Maimonides and HaChinuch state that on Yom Kippur , in addition to resting and fasting, we must refrain from all activities that care for the body; this includes washing, applying oil to the skin, and marital relations. Maimonides and HaChinuch also state that we are not to wear shoes, but Meir limits this to not wearing shoes made of leather. The commentators do not connect "afflicting the soul" with "repentance" and, in fact, do not discuss repentance with any depth at all.

  commandment: We are to rejoice at the festivals of Shavuot, Sukkot & Sh'mini Atzeret.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: There are many verses in Scripture (e.g. in Psalms and Philippians 4:4 ) that exhort us to rejoice in the Lord, and 1 Thessalonians 5:16 that exhorts us to rejoice at all times. That being said, the above Scriptures single out three festivals ( Shavuot , Sukkot , and Sh'mini Atzeret - the eighth day assembly) for rejoicing - possibly because they are festivals of harvest. Most of the appointed times listed in Leviticus 23 , while required to be kept by Jews, are only optional for Gentiles who are not K'rovei Yisrael . Sukkot is an exception however, because of Zechariah 14:16 's reference to "all the nations". That notwithstanding, its description is of the "Age to Come", so its requirement for Gentile participation in this age cannot be established. However, Gentiles connecting to its meaning is important, however, so the season appears to be a fitting time for Jewish and Gentile congregations to come together for celebration and worship.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch rely on Deuteronomy 16:14 (Maimonides and HaChinuch rely additionally on Deuteronomy 27:7 ) to state that we are to rejoice in (celebrate) all of God's feasts. They do not limit their mitzvot of celebration to Shavuot , Sukkot and Sh'mini Atzeret , although these are the only festivals in Scripture on which rejoicing or celebrating is specifically commanded.

  commandment: We are to live in a sukkah during the seven days of Sukkot.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Leviticus Scripture referenced above commands that all citizens of Israel are to live in sukkot for the seven days of the Feast (of Sukkot ), and it gives the reason - so that each generation of Israel will remember God's provision of shelter for us when He brought us out of Egypt. Although the expression "citizen of Isra'el" might be construed to mean only those Jews who live in the Land, the expression that follows it - "the people of Isra'el" - broadens its meaning to include all Jewish People, wherever in the world they may live. I believe it is also applicable to Gentiles who permanently live within the Jewish community ( K'rovei Yisrael ) because those whom God brought out of Egypt were a mixed multitude that consisted of both Jews and Gentiles ( Exodus 12:38 ). That may be part of the explanation for why worshiping God on Sukkot is required of all the Gentile nations ( Zechariah 14:16-19 ). Living in a sukkah during the Feast is not a requirement for Gentiles
    who are not K'rov Yisrael , but they may do so if they deem it meaningful. The matter of how often one must physically occupy a sukkah during the seven days of the Feast, and what functions one must perform there in order that it be counted as "dwelling" is a matter of interpretation, especially in the Diaspora where climate and other considerations have to be considered. A minimum standard that is common among Diaspora Jews is to eat at least one meal each day in a sukkah . John 7 references a Sukkot Feast that Yeshua attended, but there is no description of the sukkah in which He must have lived during the seven days. Nevertheless, the theme of Sukkot (which is living under God's provision and protection) is very much a New Covenant theme, with Yeshua, Ru'ach HaKodesh and the B'rit Chadashah Scriptures being the main New Covenant provisions.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides says relatively little in his mitzvah - merely that we are to live in a sukkah throughout the seven days of the Feast. Meir is much more detailed, adding that the sukkah must have a roof of branches, and that we must eat, drink, and otherwise live in it both day and night to the extent that one must not eat even one regular meal outside of it. HaChinuch expounds on the biblical reason for living in a sukkah , speaks a great deal about its structure, and is much more liberal than Meir in how much "living" one must do in it. He states, for example, that on the first night of Sukkot one must eat at least an olive's amount of bread in a sukkah and, after that, it is voluntary. HaChinuch also focuses on bread by stating that meals other than "regular meals of bread" may be eaten outside of a sukkah , but he adds that the early sages would not eat any meal outside of a sukkah during the Feast.

  commandment: We are to take up the four species during the Feast of Sukkot.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The four species are (1) choice fruit, (2) palm branches, (3) thick branches, and (4) willows of the brook. Traditionally, parts of each are bound together into a bouquet (sometimes referred to as a lulav , but literally, lulav only refers to a palm branch) and are preserved and waived for each of the seven days of Sukkot . The command to take up the four species clearly applies to the first day but, since the Scripture states that we are to celebrate for seven days, we suppose that waving them as part of the celebration is contemplated. Scripture does not specify a particular select fruit, so the tradition developed to use an etrog (citron) that has part of its fragile stem still attached. Halachically , therefore, the etrog becomes unusable if the short nub of a stem becomes detached. We do not know whether, during the time of Yeshua, binding the four species together and waving all four was practiced at celebrations other than Sukkot . The practice was probably
    specific to Sukkot because we read in John 12:12 (speaking of before Passover) that Yeshua was met with the waving of palm branches only. The question remains, however, "What is the significance of waving the four species at Sukkot ?" Scripture is silent on this, but its significance was probably agricultural since Sukkot is a harvest celebration. The Talmud seeks to answer this by suggesting that the four species represent God''s creation, and that waving them in all directions signifies that HaShem is Lord of all. It is significant that an expression of worship meant for God (waving palms) was used to recognize and welcome Yeshua, and it is also significant that John 12:15 states: Daughter of Tziyon, don''t be afraid! Look! your King is coming, sitting on a donkey''s colt. What it means to "take up" the four species is open to interpretation, but this Mitzvah is unquestionably applicable to Jews and, in my opinion, to K''rov Yisrael Gentiles as well. Because we don''t know exactly
    what "taking up" means, the procedure should be done according to the established practice or halachah of each community in which the worshiper finds himself. I do not believe that taking up the four species is required of other Gentiles as part of their worship of God during Sukkot, but they may do so if they deem it to be meaningful.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch state their respective mitzvot somewhat differently as follows: (1) Maimonides: Rejoice with a palm branch for the seven days; (2) Meir: Lift up (or wave) one palm branch, one etrog, three myrtle branches, and two willow branches on each of the seven days (but not on Shabbat); (3) HaChinuch: Similar to Meir, but adds considerable content from the "oral tradition", including the analogy of each species to a man''s organs. The etrog is said to be like the heart, the lulav (palm branch) like the spine, the myrtle like the eyes, and the willow like the lips.'

  commandment: We are to assemble to read and to hear the Torah read during the Festival of Sukkot in the Sabbatical Year.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: We assume that Moses gave this order in compliance with God's directive, so it should be considered Torah . The commandment involves assembling, reading aloud (teaching), hearing, and learning. All of these are good and necessary to do at times other than Sukkot and other than in the Sabbatical Year, but the commandment specifies this particular time, so it should be complied with. Since the designated place of assembly was where the Ark of God was, it is especially important to conduct the reading in Yerushalayim , at the place where the Temple last stood. Jews everywhere should be encouraged to journey there to hear, read, and otherwise participate but, for those who cannot, similar assemblies and readings can be conducted in synagogues elsewhere and at distant parts of the world. Complying with this Mitzvah today is perhaps more symbolic and ceremonial than actually needed to learn the commandments of God because, unlike in the time of Moses, synagogues the world
    over read through the entire Torah once a year every year, and printed Bibles are generally available to all. That notwithstanding, it is a general principle that blessing follows from literally obeying Torah with a heart to please God and wherever possible. Because this Mitzvah is so closely related to Jewish identity and calling, I consider it to be optional and unnecessary for non- k'rov Yisrael Gentiles.
  classical_commentators: Meir does not include this Mitzvah in his compilation, but it is treated by Maimonides and HaChinuch as a requirement for all Jews - including women, even though the commandment appears to be time-dependant. 1 HaChinuch states that the reason this assembly is so important is that possessing the Torah is what distinguishes Israel from the other nations. 1. According to the Mishnah (m. Kidd. 1:7) , women are not required to perform positive time-dependant commandments.

  commandment: We are to cancel loans and allow our land to lie fallow in the Sabbatical Year.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Sabbatical Year is characterized by the releasing of debts that are owed to us, 2 and by allowing our land to rest - that is, not cultivating the land or harvesting its crops. On the one hand, this Mitzvah can be viewed as one of benevolence (" so that the poor among your people can eat ... " Exodus 23:11 ) because (1) crops that grow of their own accord during the Sh'mittah are available to the poor for gleaning, and (2) Israelite debtors who cannot repay what they have borrowed can be released from a lifetime of bondage. On the other hand, I believe that the primary reason for the Sabbatical Year is revealed in Deuteronomy 25:20-22 , which promises God's supernatural provision to those who will obey Him and trust Him. A question that naturally comes to mind is how releasing loans and resting our land in the Sabbatical Year applies today. I am of the opinion that it continues to apply where today's circumstances are similar to those under which the ancient Israelites
    lived. Furthermore, when it does apply, it applies not only to Jews, but also to K'rov Yisrael Gentiles. How similar the circumstances need to be are revealed to us by the Ruach HaKodesh as we pray for guidance. As for most Gentiles (not K'rovei Yisrael ), I believe that their compliance is a blessing but not a requirement; I draw this conclusion (as an analogy) from Isaiah 56:1-7 , which promises blessing to the foreigner who keeps God's Sabbaths, but apparently does not require it of him. One thing that is certain, however, is that God continues to expect all of us to look to Him for provision, rather than to think that we can cause provision to come to us through our own efforts. We ought to consider the Sabbatical Year (and God's other Sabbaths - both weekly and annual) to be a test of our faith, because our willingness to release loans and to rest our land in the Sabbatical Year (as well as rest ourselves on the other Sabbaths), is an indication that we trust God, and are willing
    to rely upon Him. 2. There is a rabbinical document called a pruzbul , by which a private debt is made public by transferring it to a beit din , thus making it redeemable during and after a Sh'mittah . It is a legal contrivance to circumvent the discharge of a debt in the Sh'mittah .
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch agree that all debts must be cancelled during the Sabbatical Year, and that loans to needy Jews may not be withheld because an approaching Sh'mittah will preclude their collectability. Although Deuteronomy 15:3 permits the repayment of loans made to foreigners to be demanded during the Sh'mittah , Maimonides and HaChinuch interpret the Scripture as requiring that loans to idolaters be collected. Meir's compilation does not reference Deuteronomy 15:3 at all, and does not promulgate any such requirement. Also, none of the commentators connect trusting God with the Sh'mittah's cancellation of debts, or with Scripture's prohibition against our refusing to make uncollectable loans to needy Jews prior to a Sh'mittah . Similarly, neither Maimonides, nor Meir, nor HaChinuch connect trusting God with Scripture's requirement that we allow our land to rest during the Sabbatical Year. Meir alone asserts that agricultural commandments pertaining
    to the Sh'mittah are only applicable in Eretz Yisrael , and he therefore places them in an appendix, and lists them separately from his other mitzvot .
  commentary_juster: In modern societies that are not primarily agricultural, the Sh'mittah command (like th Jubilee command) is difficult to apply. However, there are underlying principles that have been noted by many Bible scholars. First, the command shows the importance of renewing and preserving the land so that it is not worn out. Secondly, the command shows that God does not want people to be forever burdened with debt, but rather to be able to have a new start. So, the command encompasses a principle of their needing to be a way of release from debts that lead to destruction. Bankruptcy laws are probably the modern social equivalent because the same underlying principle is involved. The Biblical text provides that assistance should be made available for those truly in need, and the Sabbatical year's discharge of debts, coupled with the requirement that we not harvest the corners of our fields (thereby allowing some of our crops to be gleaned) are special applications of God's requirement
    of us that we care for the poor.

  commandment: We are to rest our land, and return it to its prior owner in the Jubilee Year.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: We are to count seven Sabbaths of years (forty-nine years) from each Year of Jubilee to the next. When the Year of Jubilee arrives, we are not to cultivate our land or harvest its crops in the usual way, and we are to return it to its prior owner, the one who sold it to us. When land is sold, it must not be sold in perpetuity, and a right of redemption by the seller must be an inherent part of the sale. In a very real sense, therefore, the sale of land is not of the land itself, but of the value of the crops that the land is likely to produce until the next Jubilee. The Year of Jubilee, similar to the Sh'mittah , can be viewed as a time of faith and benevolence because the crops that grow of their own accord (without cultivation) during the year is available for all to glean, including those who are poor. The Jubilee can also be viewed as a mitzvah of social and economic equalization, because Israelites that become wealthy through land that they have occupied, have
    to give the source of their wealth up in the Year of Jubilee. Like the Sh'mittah , I believe that the primary reason for God giving the Jubilee Year to the Israelites was to hone their faith and cause them to have to trust Him for their provision. A question that naturally comes to mind, of course, is how resting our land and returning it to its prior owner applies to us today. I am of the opinion that it can only apply literally as in the past, where today's circumstances are similar to those under which the ancient Israelites lived. So far as I am aware it is never the case since the assumption of Scripture regarding the Jubilee is that (1) it is meant to apply only in the Land of Israel, and (2) it is meant to apply by the entire population so that the burden of returning land that one has bought does not unjustly fall on just a few individuals who are willing to comply. Still, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable ( 2 Timothy 3:16-17 ), so we ought to consider how to
    use the inspiration when the Year of Jubilee arrives. I propose that we consider it a time to reflect on our faith by considering what our willingness would be to rest our land (should we own land in geographic Israel) and give it up in the Jubilee year as a demonstration of our trust and reliance on God.
  classical_commentators: Meir has not constructed any mitzvot pertaining to the Jubilee. Maimonides and HaChinuch have, but they do not take into consideration today's changed circumstances as compared to those that existed during the time of Moses. Their mitzvot therefore require literal obedience to the Scriptures in a way that is difficult with regard to resting the land, and nearly impossible regarding its return - even in Eretz Yisrael . Similar to their Sh'mittah mitzvot , Maimonides and HaChinuch do not connect the Year of Jubilee to man's need to trust God for provision.
  commentary_juster: In modern societies that are not primarily agricultural, the Jubilee (also the Sh'mittah ) is difficult to apply. However, there are underlying principles that have been noted by many Bible scholars. First, similar to the Sh'mittah , the command shows the importance of renewing and preserving the land so that it is not worn out. Secondly, the command shows that God does not want the ownership of land to create a permanent class of landed gentry. The Jubilee promotes equal economic and social opportunity that is also the goal of our most enlightened and compassionate governmental systems. The Jubilee restoration of land does not mean socialism since there could be disparities of wealth by other means (e.g. in gold, silver, herds, etc.). However, there is a redistribution of wealth in Jubilee was well, and it therefore equalizes opportunity. I think the principle here is not to impose taxes for on-going welfare, but to use taxes (especially inheritance taxes) to provide
    education and training so that those without financial means have economic opportunity. Perhaps we could call such taxes "equal opportunity taxes".

  commandment: We are not to leave our homes with the intention of doing work on the Sabbath.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The commandment in Exodus 16:29 that is reflected in this Mitzvah was given to the Israelites after they tried to gather manna on the Sabbath despite God having provided a double portion for them the day before. In today's context, it calls for us to trust that God will provide sufficiently for us six days of the week, so that we should not even contemplate leaving our homes in order to work on the Sabbath. In my opinion, this is not a requirement that we stay in our house or limit the distance that we may travel, but rather it is a requirement that we examine why we are leaving our house, lest it be to go to work. In addition to other considerations, it is important to remember that God first established the seventh day as holy prior to the Mosaic Covenant, and at a time when there was, as of yet, no Israel ( Genesis 2:2-3 ). Later, speaking through the prophet Isaiah, God said that non-Jews who keep His Sabbaths will receive blessings for doing so ( Isaiah 56:1-7
    ). Further confirmation for this is found in Hebrews 4:1-11 which compares Sabbath rest with spiritual rest that comes from faith in Messiah. This is not to say that keeping the seventh day Sabbath is required for Gentile believers in this age. We again note the clearly stated passages in Romans 14 , Galatians 5 , Colossians 2 , and others, that relieve Gentiles of Sabbath responsibility.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides interprets his mitzvah so as to prohibit travel on the Sabbath, further than from one's home to across an Israelite's campsite in the desert. Meir's concept in his mitzvah is similar, but he describes the maximum permissible travel as the distance across a small town. HaChinuch says the Sabbath limit is three parasangs away from the city, and he explains the prohibition against traveling further by his understanding that, after God created the world, He rested in the vicinity of His creation; HaChinuch's opinion is that we should, therefore, rest in our place as well.

  commandment: We are to determine the occurrence of every new moon.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: There is no explicit biblical commandment to determine the occurrence of the New Moon ( Rosh Chodesh ), but the numerous references to the beginning of months and to the New Year makes it a logical imperative to do so. Colossians 2:16 is the only mention of the New Moon in the Apostolic Writings, but there are several references in the New Testament to months and years. The difficulty of determining the appearance of a New Moon is that there is no appearance of the moon at all. On the night of a New Moon, one sees no moon - similar to nights that are clouded over. During the time of Yeshua, the New Moon was declared by the San Hedrin upon its receiving the testimony of two individuals that they observed it. How can one see a moon that one cannot see? The testimony received was that the witnesses saw the last sliver of moon showing from the night previous. Using modern astronomical methods of determining the New Moon is more precise and is acceptable in most of Judaism
    today. Explaining these methods is, however, beyond the scope of this Mitzvah .
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch reference the above Torah Scriptures to support their respective mitzvot regarding the New Moon. Meir is silent on the subject.

  commandment: We are to keep the Sabbath Day holy - set apart for God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Scripture speaks of keeping the Sabbath Day holy by abstaining from work, resting physically, and assembling for a holy convocation. Beyond those, it is well to remember that keeping the Sabbath Day holy means treating it as special, and setting it apart for God. That does not mean that we cannot engage in some things that are ordinary or recreational, but we need to use good judgment and maintain a Sabbath consciousness. One way of making the Sabbath special is to keep track of when it begins and when it ends. Jewish practice ushers in the Sabbath on Friday evening (before sundown) with the lighting of candles, Kiddush , prayer in either the home or synagogue, and enjoying a festive meal. There are traditionally three daytime services ( Shachrit , Musaf , and Minchah ) held on Shabbat , and the Shabbat is ended with Havdalah at sundown, after which begins the first day of the next work-week (albeit after sundown) with the evening service of ma''ariv . Within the wider
    Jewish community (and especially within the Orthodox community) there are other ways of making the Sabbath special as well. From the original Torah command to not light fires, Orthodox tradition has extended the uniqueness of the day to not turning on or off electric appliances including lights, and not driving cars (spark plugs make fire). In the same way, Torah is extended to not carrying things on one''s person outside of one''s home (not even a bible or siddur to the synagogue), and not spending money (if one does not carry it, one cannot spend it). In some communities, exceptions are made for those in the military and life-saving services. We who recognize the New Covenant have an additional depth of appreciation for the Sabbath''s holiness because of what Hebrews 4:4-11 says about it: For there is a place where it is said, concerning the seventh day, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works." And once more, our present text says, "They will not enter my rest." Therefore,
    since it still remains for some to enter it, and those who received the Good News earlier did not enter, he again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David, so long afterwards, in the text already given, "Today, if you hear God''s voice, don''t harden your hearts." For if Y''hoshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later of another "day." So there remains a Shabbat-keeping for God''s people. For the one who has entered God''s rest has also rested from his own works, as God did from his. Therefore, let us do our best to enter that rest; so that no one will fall short because of the same kind of disobedience.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides states that the meaning of Exodus 20:8 is that we are to recite words proclaiming the greatness of the Sabbath day - the Kiddush at the beginning, and the Havdalah at the end. Meir agrees with Maimonides about hallowing the Sabbath with those particular words, and adds that we must recite the Kiddush prayer over either wine or bread. He also cites Isaiah 58:13 in calling the Sabbath a delight, and states that we must honor God by washing our hands and face with warm water, dressing in clean clothing, and eating a minimum of three meals. HaChinuch is in agreement about hallowing the Sabbath with words. He states that the Kiddush should be said over wine, but that the sages have allowed it to be said over bread if a man delights in bread more than wine. That notwithstanding, HaChinuch maintains that Havdalah must be conducted over wine.

  commandment: We are to rest, refrain from work, and assemble on God's annual Sabbaths; these are (1) the first and (2) seventh day of Unleavened Bread, (3) Shavuot, (4) Yom T'ruah (Rosh HaShanah), (5) Yom Kippur, (6) the first day of Sukkot and (7) Sh'mini Atzeret.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah bestows the term "Annual Sabbath" on seven of the annually-occurring "designated times" listed in Leviticus 23 . This is because, as in the case of the weekly Sabbath, we are commanded to rest on them, refrain from work, and assemble. Of these however, only one of them - Yom Kippur - is actually termed a Sabbath in the Scriptures. Each of these days has its unique theme and reason for being, but because they bear a basic similarity to the weekly Sabbath, the related issues of work, rest, and application to Gentiles will be dealt with here only briefly. The first and seventh days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread remind us of God''s provision and our need to purge leaven (analogized to sin) from our lives ( 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 ). Of all the feasts, Passover is the one that has most caught the attention of the Christian Church. This is because of the obvious analogy of the Passover lamb sacrifice to Yeshua''s sacrifice, where the blood of each of the sacrifices,
    saved those who applied it. The next "designated time" listed on the biblical calendar, Shavuot , was historically commanded to the Israelites to commemorate the Spring harvest, but it is relevant to Gentile followers of Yeshua as well, both as an identification with the Jewish People, and also as a memorial of the Shavuot that occurred centuries later, when God made the Holy Spirit available on earth to all of mankind ( Acts 2:1-21, 10:45 ). Christian terminology for this day is "Pentecost" 1 . Shavuot is unique among the Annual Sabbaths in being the only one that Scripture does not assign a particular date on the lunar calendar. Instead, Leviticus 23:10,15-16 states: Tell the people of Israel, ''After you enter the land I am giving you and harvest its ripe crops, you are to bring a sheaf od firstfruits of your harvest to the cohen ... From the day after the day of rest - that is, from the day you bring the sheaf for waving - you are to count seven full weeks, until the day after the
    seventh week; you are to count fifty days; and then you are to present a new grain offering to ADONAI.'' This fifty-day count from "the day after the day of rest" (or Sabbath) is known in Jewish practice as "counting the omer ", and which one of several possible Sabbaths is "day zero" of the count is a subject of ongoing dispute that involves two different days that Scripture refers to as "firstfruits". The first of these is the one in Leviticus 23:10 which, for clarity, I will refer to as Yom Habbikurim . 2 The second occurance is in Numbers 28:26 , where the term is again used, but for Shavuot . Yom T''ruah (day of blowing) is also known as the "Day of Trumpets" or " Shofarot ", and as " Rosh Hashanah " (head of the year, i.e. New Year) by the Rabbinic community. It is followed ten days later by Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). Although these days were historically commanded to the Israelites, Gentile followers of Yeshua may choose to observe them as well, both to identify with the Jewish
    People, and also to use as times of personal introspection and repentance that may lead to joining with their Jewish brothers in praying for Israel on Yom Kippur . This is especially appropriate when one considers the elevated position of New Covenant believers (both Jews and non-Jews) as priests under Messiah Yeshua ( 1 Peter 2:5-10 ; Revelation 1:4-7 ). Finally, Sukkot is particularly significant for Gentiles, because Scripture prophecies the time when all the Gentile nations on earth will be required to join with Israel in keeping the Feast referred to in Zechariah 14:16-19 . This appears to be a nation-to-nation mandate and not one directed to individuals. Although "rest" is not specifically mentioned in the supporting Scriptures for the Feast of Unleavened Bread and for Shavuot , it is strongly implied by the requirement that we not work. Also, although in Hebrews 4:2-11 it is the weekly Sabbath rest that is analogized to resting in Messiah, its application to all of the annual
    Sabbaths is unmistakable. I am of the view that complying with these Annual Sabbaths by resting, abstaining from work, and assembling, is mandatory for Jews and K''rovei Yisrael Gentiles but, with the exception of the Feast of Sukkot is not mandatory for Gentiles generally. That notwithstanding, I believe that blessing comes to Gentiles who keep the Annual Sabbaths, analogous to the blessing for keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath that is promised in Isaiah 56:1-7 . Keeping the Annual Sabbaths also serves to connect Gentile believers to their Jewish brethren, and enhances understanding of the events in history that led to the Messiah''s coming and to the New Covenant. 1. According to Jewish tradition, the day subsequently defined as Shavuot is also the day on which the Torah was given at Mt. Sinai. 2. Hebrew for "Day of Firstfruits."'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and Meir loosely refer to the "first day of Passover" when they mean the first day of Unleavened Bread. This is a common Jewish practice, but is at odds with the biblical definition which describes Passover as the period from before sundown on the 14 th day of the first month ( Nisan 14), to sometime early the next day ( Nisan 15), when the Israelites began their exodus from Egypt. HaChinuch specifically refers to Nisan 15, and all three commentators recognize the exception from not doing work when food preparation is needed. HaChinuch considers the first and seventh days of "Passover" to be a single festival, unlike the case of Sh'mini Atzeret . In their writings, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch assume the common rabbinical practice in the Diaspora of doubling up on each of the Annual Sabbaths except for Yom Kippur . The reason for this duplication is interesting, but will not be explored further here.
  commentary_juster: 'My view on this is that, without the support of civil law as we have in Israel, it is very difficult for Jews to do all of the Sabbaths (e.g. the seventh day of Passover and the 8 th Day of Sh''mini Atzeret ) because the number of days are just too difficult in a non-Jewish society. I think Messianic Jews should seek to keep them all as an ideal, but there is, in my view, allowance in the Diaspora for some degree of indulgence. Regarding Gentiles, there is no requirement for them to embrace the Sabbath days, as is made most clear in Colossians 2 , Romans 14 , and Galatians 5 . Also, although there is no evidence in any historical text that this was ever expected of Gentile believers, they are not relieved from understanding and applying these Sabbath days as their communities and they, as individuals, are led by the Holy Spirit. Of course, even when some level of compliance is decided upon, Gentiles are not called to add extra-biblical rabbinical practices, although
    they are not prohibited from them either. The literal partaking of the Annual Sabbaths is covenantal to the Jewish people and would seem to have application to Gentile believers in their communities as follows: There should be teachings regarding the meanings of all the Sabbaths. It would be good and reasonable to teach on the Sabbaths in the seasons of their actual celebrations in Israel and in the Jewish community. This connects the Christian world to the Jewish people with whom they are joined through Yeshua ( Romans 11 ). Whenever Christian communities are led to celebrate these Sabbaths, it would be sufficient for them to do so on the weekends closest to their biblically prescribed dates. Lastly, Christians may choose to abstain from work and rest on these Sabbaths (similar to their Jewish brothers) in identification with the Jewish people. How the Sabbaths are acknowledged and expressed in each Christian community should be led by the Holy Spirit.'

  commandment: We are to count seven weeks and fifty days from the Day of Firstfruits (following Passover) to Shavuot, at which time we are to waive two loaves of bread to the Lord.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: '" From the day after the day of rest - that is, from the day you bring the sheaf for waving " is the day we refer to as Yom HaBikkurim - Day of Firstfruits ( Leviticus 23:10 ). It is unique among the "designated times" listed in Leviticus 23 , in that it is the only one that is not a Sabbath. The occurrence of the day we call Shavuot is determined by counting from Yom HaBikkurim , and is unique among the Annual Sabbaths in being the only one to which Scripture does not assign a particular date on the lunar calendar; in that regard, it is similar to the weekly Sabbath. The fifty-day count from "the day after the day of rest" (or Sabbath) in Leviticus 23:15-16 is known in Jewish practice as "counting the omer ", and which one of several possible Sabbaths is "day zero" of the count, is a subject of ongoing debate. To add complication, Numbers 28:26 calls Shavu''ot " Yom HaBikkurim " as well, the reason being that there were two harvests involved. Jewish orthodoxy has
    adopted the Pharisaic view that the count should start from Nisan 16, the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, thus causing Shavuot to always fall on the 6 th day of Sivan . By contrast, many in Messianic Judaism have adopted the Sadducean view which is that the count should start on the day after the Seventh-Day Sabbath that falls in the midst of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This causes the count to begin on the first day of the week (a Sunday), on Yom HaBikkurim , making this day the probable day of Yeshua''s resurrection. A result of this is that Shavuot falls on different days of the lunar calendar in adjacent years, a consequence that seems to have been intended in the Leviticus 23 account. When requiring that there be an animal sacrifice to accompany the grain offering of Shavuot , Scripture assumes the existence of a Tabernacle (or Temple) and an operating Levitical priesthood. Since we have neither today, counting to Shavu''ot and waiving two loaves of bread in the synagogue
    are correct adaptations of the Scripture, and are obligatory for both Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. Gentiles of the Nations should also keep track of the count because knowing when Shavuot occurs is important for connecting them to the Jewish people, and for commemorating the Holy Spirit''s appearance in Jerusalem on the Shavuot following Yeshua''s resurrection ( Acts 2:1-21, 10:45 ).'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides analogizes the individual obligation to count the omer to the San Hedrin's obligation to count the Years of Jubilee "year by year and Sabbatical cycle by Sabbatical cycle." He also gives much attention to justifying why counting fifty days and seven Sabbaths is one mitzvah and not two, but makes no mention of when the count should begin. Meir, in contrast, does not even mention that counting both days and Sabbaths comprises one commandment, but specifically states that we are to start to count the night of the sixteenth of Nisan , and that we are to count while standing and accompany the count with a benediction. HaChinuch states that we must count forty-nine days from the presentation of the sheaf offering, which is the sixteenth of Nisan , and we must utter the day count and the week count separately. He agrees that we are to do the count while standing and with an accompanying benediction. Despite the different way that HaChinuch expresses the number
    of days counted, all three commentators endorse the Pharisaic way of counting - not the Sadducean way.

  commandment: We are to maintain our home and all territory that is under our control completely free of leaven and chametz, from Passover through all seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah requires that no leaven, whether alone or part of food containing leaven ( chametz ), be in a Jew's possession or within his control during the seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This implies that he (or she) must, before sundown on the 14 th day of Nisan , remove it from his house, garage, shed, trash bin, business property, territory domain, or anywhere else where he has proprietary rights of control, and must not let it back in for seven full days. This abstinence commemorates the Jews' hasty departure from Egypt, when they had no time to allow their bread to rise and therefore had to eat unleavened bread on the first leg of their journey. According to Exodus 12:19 , obedience to this commandment is not an option for either a Jew or a Gentile who is a " citizen of the land " ( K'rov Yisrael ). Leaven is analogized to sin in 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 and in Galatians 5:7-9 , and its removal from our lives is directly linked to the Passover, and to
    the Passover lamb - our Messiah. But leaven is not always symbolic of sin, as we can see from Leviticus 23:17 , which requires that the firstfruits bread offering of Shavuot be made with leaven. The particulars of what should be considered leaven and chametz are controversial within Jewry. Sephardim and Ashkenazim follow different rules on the subject, and Messianic Jewish communities are equally diverse. Is leaven anything that can cause food to rise, or must there be fermentation in order for it to qualify? What grains must be removed from the house because they are subject to spontaneous fermentation during storage? Rice? Barley? Beans? Discussions of such particulars are found in the Talmudic literature, but not in any of the classical mitzvah codifications. I do not think it would be judicious for me to express my opinion of these particulars here. The general idea in the Scriptures is that the Israelites' bread that would otherwise have fermented with yeast did not have time to
    rise. Therefore, our not keeping casually-stored grains that would have had time to ferment and rise would seem to be the general intent of the biblical text. The legal fiction, in which people sometimes engage, of keeping control of their chametz (whether stored in their house or not) by selling it to a Gentile for a minimum amount of money with the understanding that the Gentile will sell it back to them after the days of Unleavened Bread is not in accord with the spirit of the Scriptures. People should gauge their purchases and production of leavened products so as to minimize their material loss, but they should not engage in subterfuge. This Mitzvah is mandated for Jews and K'rovei Yisrael , but not for Gentiles generally; the text of 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 cited above is therefore metaphorical in its application as to them.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch distinguish between not possessing leaven and not finding it in one's house. Meir and HaChinuch require that a Jew search his house for leaven, whereas Maimonides does not mention such a requirement. None of the commentators attempt to define "leaven", but HaChinuch says that yeast is an example of it. Meir states that if a non-Jew places chametz in a Jew's house and the Jew has not taken responsibility for it, the chametz need not be destroyed; otherwise it must be.

  commandment: We are not to eat chametz from Passover through the seventh day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: Chametz is any food that contains leaven, the quintessential one being bread leavened with yeast. This Mitzvah states that we must not eat chametz , from Passover through the seventh day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Each of the supporting Scriptures above states it a little differently. Exodus 13:3 instructs abstention from chametz , Exodus 12:19-20 prohibits eating food that contains chametz , and Deuteronomy 16:2-3 prohibits eating chametz along with the sacrificed Passover lamb, all of which amount to the same thing which is to not eat chametz during the seven days of Unleavened Bread. The particulars of what should be considered leaven and chametz are controversial among Jewry. Sephardic and Ashkenazic communities follow different rules on the subject, and Messianic Jewish communities are equally diverse. Is leaven anything that can cause food to rise, or must there be fermentation in order for it to qualify? What grains must be removed from the house because
    they are subject to spontaneous fermentation during storage? Rice? Barley? Beans? Discussions of such particulars are found in the Talmudic literature, but not in any of the classical mitzvah codifications. I do not think it would be judicious for me to express my opinion of these particulars here. The general idea in the Scriptures is that the Israelites' bread that would otherwise have fermented with yeast did not have time to rise. Therefore, a commonly held view that our not keeping casually-stored grains that would have had time to ferment and rise is what Scripture intends. An alternative view discounts the effect of airborne yeast and calls for discarding only those items that contain added leaven. The commercially prepared foods found in today's homes pose a special problem of identification in that some contain leaven where you would not expect it. Soups, for example, often contain yeast. My personal practice is to read all of the labels on packaged and canned foods and discard
    those that contain the words "leaven" or "yeast". This Mitzvah is mandated for Jews and K'rov Yisrael Gentiles, but not for Gentiles generally. Exodus 12:19-20 makes this clear in that most Gentiles were not part of the community of Israel in the first place, so their being cut off from it for eating chametz is meaningless.
  classical_commentators: The classical commentators' mitzvot and this Mitzvah are in agreement except for terminology. They use the word " Pesach " as inclusive of both Passover and the 7 days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, whereas my use of the word refers only to the evening period from Nisan 14 to 15 when God "passed over" the homes of those Israelite families that applied the blood of the sacrificed lamb to their doorposts. Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch agree that chametz is not to be eaten after the middle of the 14 th day of Nisan because the Passover lamb was slaughtered at dusk.

  commandment: We are to eat matzah, bitter herbs, and lamb on Passover.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Exodus 12:3-8 gives details of the first Passover that occurred on the 14 th day of the first month (on the Jewish lunar calendar), the evening before the Israelites were led out of Egypt. God subsequently commanded the Israelites to keep the Passover as an annual remembrance of their deliverance ( Deuteronomy 16:1-2 ), and Leviticus 23:5 clarifies that Passover is only part of the day, between sundown and complete darkness. On the original Passover in Egypt, the Israelites were instructed to eat a sacrificed lamb with matzah and bitter herbs ( maror ). Numbers 9:10-11 is significant here because, by commanding Passover observance a month late under certain circumstances, the point is made that Passover is to be kept each year as a lasting ordinance; it was not just a one-time event. Lambs were sacrificed on Passover until the destruction of the Second Temple, after which, animal sacrifice could no longer be done. Even had the Temple not been destroyed, it is doubtful
    that the Passover sacrifice would have continued among the Jewish followers of Yeshua because they understood Him to be their "once and for all" sacrificed lamb. On the other hand, they might have partaken of it as part of a memorial to Yeshua, since we see Paul and other disciples engaged in Temple sacrifices long after the time of Yeshua''s death ( Acts 21 ). What remains of Passover observance for Jews today, is that we partake of a seder meal on the evening of Nisan 14, during which we eat lamb if we are Sephardic (we do not if we are Ashkenaz), unleavened bread and maror (bitter herbs), and we abstain from eating (or even possessing) leaven. The Sephardim look at the eating of lamb differently from the Ashkenazim. The Sephardim eat it in remembrance of the sacrificed Passover lamb, and the Ashkenazim abstain so that no one can interpret it as constituting a present day sacrifice. There was one Passover meal (described in Matthew 26:26 , Mark 14:22 , and Luke 22:19 ), at which Yeshua
    picked up a piece of matzah from the table, broke it, and gave it to the twelve disciples who were with Him, to eat and make a memory they would later use as a memorial of His body that was be broken during the sacrifice He was about to endure. This, along with the wine He also spoke of, I consider to be a new commandment to His disciples (present and future - Jew and Gentile). Observing the Passover (without sacrificing a lamb) is mandatory for Jews and K''rov Yisrael Gentiles. It is optional for other Gentiles who may also want to observe it (albeit in some adaptive manner) as a way of identifying with the Jewish People, and also as an acknowledgement of Passover''s prophetic significance that points to Yeshua. Over the centuries, various Jewish halachic practices have developed that define how Passover is observed in Jewish communities. Gentiles who choose to observe Passover may borrow from these, but are free to depart as well, and to develop their own customs and expressions. It
    should be noted that the historic churches sometimes call the period from Good Friday to Resurrection Sunday "Passover" ( Pascha ) and do keep it to a degree, but usually without adequate reference to its Exodus roots. Finally, a word needs to be said about the prohibition to Gentiles recorded in Exodus 12:43-49 : ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon, "This is the regulation for the Pesach lamb: no foreigner is to eat it. But if anyone has a slave he bought for money, when you have circumcised him, he may eat it. Neither a traveler nor a hired servant may eat it. It is to be eaten in one house. You are not to take any of the meat outside the house, and you are not to break any of its bones. The whole community of Isra''el is to keep it. If a foreigner staying with you wants to observe ADONAI''s Pesach, all his males must be circumcised. Then he may take part and observe it; he will be like a citizen of the land. But no uncircumcised person is to eat it. The same teaching is to apply equally
    to the citizen and to the foreigner living among you." This prohibition only applies to eating the sacrificed Passover lamb (which we no longer do). It does not apply to the other aspects of Passover observance, so Gentiles are completely free to attend and even conduct Passover sedarim .'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch all recognize the requirement to eat matzah on Passover. Meir also says that we must eat matzah , maror , and charoset (a sweet paste-like mixture), and that the matzah we eat must be made of wheat, barley, spelt, oats, or rye. He also says that we are prohibited from eating matzah the day before Passover, so that our appetite for it will be increased. Maimonides and HaChinuch do not mention eating maror , but refer their readers to the Talmud's tractate Pesachim for other provisions of the mitzvah . Maimonides and HaChinuch state that it is the evening of the 15 th day of Nisan when we are to eat unleavened bread; Meir says it is on the 1 st night of Passover when we must eat it, but does not indicate the date.

  commandment: Anyone who cannot observe Passover on the 14 day of Nisan must make every attempt to do so by eating matzah and maror the following month on the 14 th day of Iyar.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: I believe the two reasons given in Numbers 9:10 for delaying Passover observance are not the only two intended, but are rather meant to suggest others as well that are equally valid. For example, if a Jewish man or woman cannot observe Passover on the 14 th of Nisan due to illness, he or she must earnestly seek to do so a month later on the 14 th of Iyar . I consider this mitzvah mandatory for individual Jews and for K'rov Yisrael Gentiles who find themselves in the position of not being able to fulfill their Passover observance obligation on the 14 th of Nisan . Other Gentiles, however, should they undertake this Mitzvah would, in my opinion be wrongly stating that meticulous Passover observance is an obligation as to them. For that reason, I consider literal compliance of this Mitzvah to be unauthorized and not recommended for Gentiles who are not K'rovei Yisrael .
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch do not include a delayed Passover observance among their listed mitzvot .

  commandment: We are to preserve God's Word, & disseminate His Word to the Gentile nations.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Jewish People (previously called Israelites and defined as those descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), are God's original and primary priesthood to the Gentile nations. This priesthood was proclaimed during the time of Moses, and its purpose was (and still is) to bring the Word of God (indeed God Himself) to those in the world who do not know Him. By virtue of Yeshua's sacrifice and the New Covenant that he brought, all who receive Yeshua as Lord and savior become affiliated through grafting into a "Jewish" olive tree ( Romans 17:11 , etc.), not to lose their original intrinsic identities as Jews or non-Jews, but to become members together in a new (co-existing) priesthood that has come to be known as the "priesthood of believers" ( 1 Peter 2:4-5 ). This new priesthood has functions and responsibilities that overlap with those of the Jewish priesthood, but the latter retains its historic place in preserving and disseminating the Word of God, and now being the
    host priesthood to the priesthood of believers.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch do not address disseminating God's Word to others directly. They imply it by emphasizing commandments (e.g. t'fillin , m'zuzot , tzitzit ) that are visible reminders.

  commentary_rudolph: It is a common misunderstanding to believe that God's covenant with Abraham (repeated through Isaac and Jacob) applies only to Jews. The Abrahamic Covenant defines the Jewish people generationally, but it is also the framework for Gentiles to willfully connect themselves to the Jewish people, thereby enlarging the "people of God" that comprises both Jews and Gentiles. It is why God told Abraham that he would be the " father of many nations. " ( Genesis 17:4 ). That notwithstanding, Gentiles (even K'rovei Yisrael - those closely connected to a Jewish community) are not themselves Jews because their priestly identity and covenantal responsibilities are not inherited, but are rather, voluntarily derived from their connection to the Jewish People through their covenant with the Jewish Messiah. In the Mosaic Covenant, Gentiles who wanted a special covenantal relationship with God received it by physically moving into the Jewish camp, becoming circumcised, sacrificing at
    the Tabernacle or Temple, and becoming part of the Jewish community. In the New Covenant, Gentiles who want a special covenantal relationship with God receive it by becoming grafted into the "Jewish" olive tree through faith in Messiah Yeshua (see Romans the "Jewish" olive tree through faith in Messiah Yeshua (see Romans 11 ). 1 B'rit milah (covenant circumcision) was (and still is) required of all Jewish males who are eight days old lest they be cut off from the covenant they have inherited. In the Mosaic Covenant, circumcision was required of any Gentile male who lived in a Jewish household and wished to covenantally connect to the Jewish people. Such a Gentile became subject to most of the commandments of Torah , but it did not result in his becoming a Jew or a Jewish convert, 2 and it is clear from Acts 15:1-20 that circumcision was not required for their salvation. Circumcising a Jewish child has historically been considered the duty of the child's father, but an experienced circumciser
    (a mohel ) is often employed. The surgery can be performed by a non-Jew, but only a Jew can receive the child into the covenant. The prevailing view is that b'rit milah should be done on the eighth day after birth when possible. So important is this eighth day principle, that halachah requires that circumcision be performed on that day even if it falls on a Sabbath. 1. Jewish individuals who have been broken off of their olive tree through unbelief have to be re-grafted. Jews that remain unconnected to their tree retain their covenantal responsibilities but not their salvific relationship with God. 2. Uncircumcised Gentiles can participate in today's Passover seders because today's seders do not include eating a sacrificed Passover animal (see Exodus 12:43-49 ). In 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 , Paul makes it clear that Yeshua is our sacrificed lamb, and he thereby encourages the Gentiles to whom he is speaking to celebrate the seder . We do not require that K'rov Yisrael Gentiles be circumcised.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch are in agreement concerning the requirement that a Jewish baby be circumcised on the eighth day if possible. HaChinuch and Meir state that if a Jewish baby is not circumcised, then there is a continuing obligation on the part of the uncircumcised individual to become circumcised when he is older. It is interesting that Maimonides and HaChinuch state that mothers have no responsibility to circumcise their sons in view of Moses' wife Zipporah having circumcised her son ( Exodus 4:24-26 ). Meir states that circumcision should be done after sunrise.
  commentary_juster: We note that participating at Passover seders has special meaning for believers in Yeshua because the fullness of the meaning of Passover is in the death of Yeshua as our Passover Lamb. As such, in the New Covenant order, both Jews and Gentiles commonly participate in the meaning of the Passover sacrifice in its New Covenant fulfilment form. Regarding Gentile participants in particular, since the Passover meal practiced by Jewish people today is a memorial without the sacrificial lamb, it is common for Gentiles to participate, even in traditional Jewish seders , without violating the Scriptures.

  commandment: We are to first sanctify and then ceremonially redeem our firstborn son from priestly service.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is formulated by joining together two commandments (directed to the Israelites) that were priesthood-related - the second reversing the first. Subsequent to God having saved the firstborn sons of the Israelites when He slew the firstborn males (both sons and cattle) of the Egyptians ( Exodus 11:4-6 ), He declared also, that all firstborn of the womb belonged to Him ( Exodus 13:1-2 , 34:19 ; Numbers 3:13 ). We understand that to mean that each Israelite family was to sanctify its firstborn son (i.e., dedicate him to service in the Tabernacle and later the Temple). After Moses rebuked the Israelites for worshiping the Golden Calf and only the Levites stepped forward to repent ( Exodus 32:25-29 ), God took the priesthood away from the Israelites as a whole, and gave it to the Levites ( Numbers 1:49-53 , 3:12 ), appointing the sons of Aaron to serve as cohanimi in place of the firstborn sons of the Israelites ( Numbers 3:10 ). He did this, not by revoking
    His previous commandment to sanctify each Israelite firstborn son, but by commanding that each Israelite family redeem their firstborn son from priestly service by paying a Levitical cohen five shekalim of money ( Numbers 3:40-51 , 18:15-16 ). Because underlying this Mitzvah are commandments with which Levites can no longer comply, I could have easily omitted it as being obsolete. I chose not to do so, however, because (1) the ceremony of Pidyon HaBen (redemption of the firstborn son) is performed among many Jewish people today, and (2) Yeshua''s consecration (and possibly His simultaneous Pidyon HaBen ) is recorded in Luke 2:22-32 . There is no biblically specified ceremony for sanctifying the firstborn son today, although circumcision may be thought of as a sanctification ceremony for all male Jewish children, with the firstborn of them assumed to be specially sanctified. Today, when the firstborn son of a Jewish family (not a cohen or a Levite) is 30 days old, he is taken to a Levitical
    cohen who receives the monetary equivalent of five shekalim from the father, and then proceeds to bless the child with the Birkat Cohanim (the Aaronic Benediction). Since Temple shekalim are no longer in use, their equivalent value in silver is substituted - either special coins made for the purpose or, in the U.S., five pre-1936 silver dollars (26.73 grams of 90% silver). It is obvious that this Mitzvah is based upon the assumption of a functioning Temple priesthood that does not exist today. Nevertheless, I believe it is important for Messianic Jews to comply ceremonially in the universal Jewish way for three reasons: (1) without it, there is no closure regarding the priestly status of firstborn male Israelites beyond their general priestly identity as Jews; (2) without it, there is ambiguity regarding the continuing priestly status of today''s descendants of Aaron (i.e. Levitical cohanim ); and (3) there is value in our being in solidarity with the rest of the Jewish world on this.
    I do not, however, believe that failing to comply with this Mitzvah in this New Covenant age is sinful. The ceremony of Pidyon HaBen only has meaning when performed within non-Levitical Jewish families since historically, the Levites were not redeemed and did, therefore, serve in the Temple. Although the ceremony is traditionally the responsibility of a firstborn son''s Jewish father, in Messianic Judaism it may also be performed by his Jewish mother or by himself when he comes of age. The Pidyon HaBen ceremony has no historic or spiritual meaning at all for Gentiles.'
  classical_commentators: 'Meir states that the Pidyon HaBen is to be performed after thirty days by Jewish families who are neither cohanim nor Levites and, if a firstborn son has no father, he must redeem himself after he comes of age; HaChinuch says this also of a son who has a father, but the father does not redeem him. Maimonides and HaChinuch agree with Meir on all matters, and specifically state that the Pidyon HaBen is to be performed by the father - not by the mother. Meir quotes Scripture that speaks of our need to sanctify the firstborn of kosher animals as well, of which we are to say: "This is hereby holy." He says that if we do not consecrate a firstborn kosher animal it is, nevertheless, holy. He also says that because there is no Temple, the firstborn animals must be left to graze until they develop a defect, and must then be given to a cohen . Both Maimonides and HaChinuch state that the consecration of cattle is to occur only in the Land of Israel, whereas Meir is silent
    on the matter.'

  commandment: We are to be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, proclaimers of the Good News, and a light to the Gentiles.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The designation of Israel to be a "kingdom of priests" and a "nation set apart" originated with the covenant that God made with Abraham. It was renewed through Isaac and again through Jacob, and came into fullness with the covenant that God made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai. We call the covenant with Abraham "the Abrahamic Covenant," and the one at Mount Sinai, "the Mosaic Covenant". Although the Mosaic Covenant was given to Israel, its ultimate purpose was not only to benefit Israel, but rather that, through Israel functioning as a kingdom of priests, the rest of the world (i.e. the Gentile nations) would be blessed. God's plan was (and still is) to bring His Word to the Jew first, and the Jew to bring it to the Gentile. It doesn't always work out that way, but that is the overall plan. Edom, Assyria, and ancient Egypt have a special role in that plan as being examples of the nations of the world that do not know God. The Israelites of old had reason to despise
    these three in particular. Esau (the patriarch of the Edomites) showed disdain for his birthright by selling it to his brother Jacob, and he later hated his brother for it ( Genesis 27:41 ). At one point in history, Assyria (Iran today) subjugated Edom (which became an Assyrian vassal state), and captured and subjugated the Israelites of ancient Samaria. Both Edom and Assyria were, therefore, enemies of Israel at one time, and Egypt became an enemy of ancient Israel as well. Although Egypt first sheltered and provided sustenance for the Israelites, it later oppressed and enslaved them. What is remarkable considering what has transpired, is that the Mosaic Scriptures name all three as blessed nations, and though they (the three nations) and their descendants may hate us and hate God's ways even today, we are, nevertheless, to bring the "Good News" of Yeshua to them with love and with the hope and expectation that some will receive it. In that way and through our prayers and our example
    of being a servant people devoted to loving God and neighbor, the Jewish people are uniquely commissioned by God to be a light to their own ("the lost sheep of the house of Israel") first, and then to the Gentile nations of the world.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch wrote mitzvot stating that we are not to exclude the descendants of Esau and of the Egyptians from full membership in our Jewish communities after they have become proselytes; Meir did not write on the subject. All three commentators wrote mitzvot requiring b'rit milah for Jews.
  commentary_juster: 'In regard to Assyria and Egypt: Despite the fact that Israel had to struggle with these two empires throughout its history, their people will nevertheless come to embrace the God of Israel and be one with the Jewish people, as the rest of the nations also come to the knowledge of God ( Isaiah 2:1-4 , supra).'

  commandment: We are nto to encourage Jewish conversion, but are to receive as Jewish Proselytes or Converts, those who have received conversion under reputable Jewish auspices.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The following incorporates excerpts from Tikkun International''s 1 halachic 2 paper " The Status of Gentiles in Messianic Judaism :" 3 The word "conversion" has a particularly onerous meaning in the history of Judaism because of its association with persecutions of the Jewish people, and attempts to force Jews to "convert" to Christianity by abandoning their Jewish identity and assimilating into the Christian Church. That notwithstanding, the American Jewish community also uses the term to describe the process of receiving Gentiles into the Jewish people by making them Jewish "converts" (proselytes) and, as generally understood, fully Jews. The modern Church and Synagogue have, generally speaking, come to use the term "conversion" as a process by which the "converted" person becomes one of their own flock, rather than as a process whereby one''s heart is "converted" from unbelief to one of repentance and faith. This is evident when some Christian denominations do not
    recognize the baptisms of other Christian denominations, and when groups or denominations within Judaism decline to recognize conversions conducted by other (usually less observant) sectors of the Jewish community. The word "proselyte", derived from (proselytos), is used in the Septuagint (LXX) to refer to Gentile "strangers" or "sojourners" in the land of Israel. Gentiles that worshipped the God of Abraham appear very early in the Bible and, by the time of Moses, two categories of "strangers" were recognized. They were those that were subordinate to the Israelites, and those that took on full citizenry that included membership in tribes, and even inheritance of land (see Exodus 12:48-49 and Ezekiel 47:21-23 ). The practice of receiving Gentiles into Israel continued throughout the centuries and today, the terms "Jewish proselyte" and "Jewish convert" are synonymous, and refer to former Gentiles who have irreversibly taken on covenantal Jewish identity that is subsequently conveyed to
    their children (through inheritance) dor l''dor . From the time of their "conversions", these proselytes or converts are considered, by the Jewish community, to be Jews in every way. It was inevitable that the matter of "conversion" would make its way into Messianic Judaism. It has always been an issue among us because of desire for unity in mixed marriages, because there are Gentiles within our congregations who perceive that they are called to become Jewish for various reasons (some good and some not so good), and because some Messianic Jewish congregations limit certain aspects of synagogue life to Jews. In tension with it, the biblical legitimacy of conversion has been questioned, principally because of the admonitions of the Apostle Paul to Gentiles in 1 Corinthians 7:17-20 and Galatians 5:1-6, 11-13 that they should not be circumcised, and because of the instruction to Gentiles in Acts 15 that they are exempt from the requirement of full Torah observance for salvation. It is Tikkun''s
    opinion (and the opinion of the authors herein), that the conversion of Gentiles to becoming Jewish proselytes should be discouraged in most cases, but that there are exceptions (illustrated by Ruth 1:16-17 and Esther 8:17b ) where it should be allowed. Related to this, it has been noticed there are two categories of Gentiles that populate Messianic Jewish congregations today, analogous to two categories that existed within Israel during the time of Moses. Back then there were those that were genuinely and permanently joined to the nation and the God of Israel (similar to the Gentiles that accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt), and there were those that lived in proximity to the camp of Israel and did business with the Israelites, but remained unaffiliated with the community. Today it is different of course, due to the New Covenant. Today, all Gentiles who receive Yeshua as Lord and Messiah are supernaturally grafted into the " Romans 11 olive tree," and become equal citizens along
    with all Jewish believers in Yeshua, in what is termed the "commonwealth of Israel" ( Ephesians 2:12 , NKJ). The Gentiles that are part of this "Commonwealth" of faith comprise the larger circle of Gentile believers. They are joined to the Jewish people by genuine affiliation, but there is an inner circle as well. Most Gentile citizens of the Commonwealth, while recognizing their grafted-in relationship with the Jewish people, do not consider themselves to be (nor do they want to be) part of the Jewish community per se; these are the believers that we call "Christians". There are, however, some Gentile citizens of the commonwealth who are called by God to have a special and permanent connection to the Jewish community - to live among Jews (Messianic Jews preferably), to maintain a Torah -observant New Covenant lifestyle, to marry Messianic Jewish believers or Gentiles similarly called, to raise their children in Messianic Jewish life, and to participate in Messianic Jewish covenantal
    responsibilities along with their Jewish comrades. Tikkun designates Gentiles who are so called to be known as K''rovei Yisrael (singular K''rov Yisrael ), - "those who are closely related to Israel." 4 We use this term to recognize Gentiles who are a genuine part of the Jewish community, but who have not converted to become Jews. Because a Jew and Gentile who marry produce Jewish children, for the sake of Jewish continuity we discourage Messianic Jews from marrying those who would raise their family outside of the Messianic Jewish community even if both are believers in Yeshua. Mixed marriages of Messianic Jews and K''rovei Yisrael are non-problematic, however, because they both have lifelong callings to the Jewish people, and are therefore certain to bring their children up to understand and embrace their Jewish identities and Jewish covenant obligations. As for two K''rovei Yisrael who marry: They will no doubt influence their children to be K''rovei Yisrael as well, but they cannot
    guarantee it because K''rov Yisrael Gentiles cannot convey their identities generationally as do Jews. Children of K''rov Yisrael parents have a choice, and may believe that they are not called primarily to live among Jewish people or to take on a Messianic Jewish communal way of life. While we recognize the biblical legitimacy of Jewish conversion, we do not encourage K''rov Yisrael Gentiles to convert because Gentile identity ( K''rov Yisrael identity included) is as important in serving God as is Jewish identity. That notwithstanding, we consider conversion an acceptable option for those K''rovei Yisrael Messianic Gentiles who are either married to Jews, betrothed or engaged to Jews, legally adopted by Jews, or who have a Jewish parent or grandparent and wish to acquire, re-acquire, or affirm, Jewish identity. We discourage conversions under non-Messianic Jewish (i.e. rabbinical) auspices, but are of the opinion that we should receive persons as Jews who are converted by any appropriate
    and reputable Jewish authority. The procedure of conversion consists essentially of two parts: (1) making a covenant declaration or oath before witnesses (similar to Ruth''s declaration to Naomi), and (2) acceptance of the covenant declaration by one or more bona fide representatives of the Jewish community (Ruth was received, and her marriage to Boaz was endorsed by the elders of their Jewish community). For men, conversion also requires brit milah (covenant circumcision), and we recommend tevilah (ritual immersion) in keeping with the custom of our people. 1. Tikkun International (a.k.a. "Tikkun") is a Messianic Jewish apostolic network and covenant community of fivefold ministry leaders and congregations. 2. Tikkun''s understanding of New Covenant Halacha is apostolic guidance and, as such, is not binding in the same way as it is understood in historical Judaism. This is principally because New Covenant believers rely on the Ruach HaKodesh to direct them individually. 3. "The Status
    of Gentiles in Messianic Judaism:" Tikkun International , June 12, 2009. 4. See A Place in the Tent; Intermarriage and Conservative Judaism, Oakland: EKS, 2004.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch constructed mitzvot commanding that we exclude the descendants of Esau or of Egyptians from our Jewish communities after they become proselytes, nor refuse to intermarry with them beyond the second generation. While these two nations are singled out as favored, classical Jewish interpretation of Deuteronomy 23:6(5)-9(8) seems to support conversion.

  commandment: We are to be reminded of and teach God's Word through tzitzit, tefillin, & mezuzot.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'What is common to tzitzit , tefillin , & mezuzot , is that all three are visible reminders of the Word of God, and teaching and remembering God''s Word through their use appears to be a Jewish covenant responsibility. The question that must be answered, however, is whether tefillin (phylacteries) and tzitzit (fringes) must be physically worn (and in what circumstances), and mezuzot physically affixed to our doorposts and gates, or whether the Scriptural commandments regarding them are intended to be metaphoric. Orthodox Judaism has concluded that they are all meant to be physically applied, while the Conservative and Reform Jewish community has concluded that the requirement of mezuzot is physical, and the others are symbolic or metaphoric. Practical as this latter interpretation seems to be, it is not likely correct because the commandments regarding tefillin and mezuzot are contained in the very same verses of Scripture, and they should both, therefore, be understood
    to be either one way or the other. My conclusion is that the tefillin and mezuzot are meant to be metaphoric but the requirement to wear fringes with a cord of blue is meant to be physical. Putting God''s words on our foreheads and tying them to our arms most likely means that God should always be in our thoughts and in what we do, and writing them on our door-frames most likely means that our homes should be dedicated to all that is godly. No harm is done, however, if one elects to apply them all physically, or to physically wear tzitzit and display mezuzot but decline to wear tefillin . This is one of those calls that (short of God revealing it prophetically) cannot be proven, but I offer several considerations that lean to the literal. First, hanging a m''zuzah on the doorpost of a house has the actual effect of reminding those who enter of God''s commandments and that only holy thoughts and deeds are welcome within. Second, because displaying m''zuzot is entirely a Jewish custom,
    it has the additional benefit of announcing to all who enter that sons and daughters of the Covenant live there, thus promoting God''s primary purpose for Israel, which is to be a nation of priests and a light to the Gentiles. I cannot help but think of another occasion in the Scriptures where the children of Israel were commanded to put something on the doorposts of their homes - the blood of the Pesachi - the Passover lamb sacrifice as described in Exodus 12:7, 13 : They are to take some of the blood and smear it on the two sides and top of the door-frame at the entrance of the house in which they eat it ... The blood will serve you as a sign marking the houses where you are; when I see the blood, I will pass over you - when I strike the land of Egypt, the death blow will not strike you. Although one can see how God''s instruction to the Israelites could have been interpreted metaphorically (as in the case of the Deuteronomy 6 and 11 mitzvah ), several things were accomplished by their
    complying literally. First, it served to identify the houses'' occupants as believers in God and trusters in His Word. Second, it served to identify the houses'' occupants as probably being Israelites. Third, treating God''s commandment metaphorically and failing to physically apply the blood to the doorposts would not have been sufficient and would have resulted in death of the firstborn for that house. As I have already said, in Orthodox Jewish communities all men wear tzitziyot , and there is discussion about whether they are also appropriate for women; Orthodox women normally do not wear them. In communities that have not adopted policies regarding tzitziyot , each individual must make his own decision about whether to wear them as described in Scripture, or substitute some other article of clothing or accessory that will accomplish the same thing - reminding anyone seeing it of the commandments of God. What fringes are is self-evident, so our decisions (other than whether to wear
    them at all) are what to make them of, whether and how to knot them, what the color and origin of the dye for the blue thread should be, and to what articles of clothing they should be attached. Since the only requirement in Scripture is that they be placed on the corners of garments, unless one''s community defines the particulars of acceptable tzitziyot , the wearer can use his own judgment on all of these. The orthodox Jewish community has adopted detailed rules for the construction of tzitziyot , which their male members attach to a special four-cornered garment called a tallit katan , and wear under their shirts or vests. Tzitziyot are also worn on the traditional rectangular prayer shawl, the tallit gadol . Both the tallit katan and the tallit gadol are often intentionally lacking the prescribed blue thread. 1 It is important to not to get so involved in the details of how to make tzitziyot , that we forget what they are supposed to remind us of, which are the commandments of God.
    We are not only to be reminded, but to be made continually aware of God''s commandments as we proceed through each day. I believe that the commandment to wear tzitziyot is applicable for both Jewish men and Jewish women, notwithstanding the prevailing modern practice of their only being worn by men. The principle of wearing tzitziyot is also applicable to Gentiles, but there is greater liberty for them and, in fact, it may be preferable that Gentiles (other than K''rovei Yisrael ) not wear fringes because the wearing of fringes today has become almost completely associated with being a Jew. If there is a concern, some kind of substitution to accomplish the same purpose is easily adaptable. It is interesting to note that not all references to tefillin are for the purpose of remembering God''s Word broadly. Exodus 13:9 connects the tefillin to remembering how God brought the Jewish people out of Egypt. 1. The practice among some to not include the blue thread has its origin in the scarcity
    of the chilazon - a sea creature from which the blue dye was originally extracted.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch adopt the Orthodox view that tzitzit , tefillin , & mezuzot are meant to be applied physically, and they address each one (including the tefillin of the arm and head) as a separate mitzvah . They also construe the particulars of each (i.e. their shapes, appearances, contents, and how they are applied) according to that which is written in the Talmud .

  commandment: We are to support the Lord's work among men through our tithes, offerings, & charitable giving.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: Tithing first appears in the Bible when Abraham gives one-tenth of the increase of his wealth to Melchizedek ( Genesis 14:18-20 ), and it appears again in Genesis 28:13-22 , when God promises Jacob blessing and land, and Jacob, in turn, promises to return ten percent of that which he is given by way of provision back to God. This was not, as some construe it, an attempt on Jacob's part to bargain with God, but rather an expression of Jacob's acceptance of the Covenant that had just been passed on to him, and his acknowledgement that all things with which he would be blessed in fulfillment of that Covenant belonged to God. The tithe appears again as part of the Mosaic Law, in which the Israelites were commanded to give one-tenth of their increase (usually crops and animals) to sustain the Levites who had no inheritance of land. Offerings over and above tithes, used for other purposes, are also prescribed in the Mosaic Law (certain offerings were required and certain
    ones were voluntary), but a percentage of income was not required of offerings as it was of tithes. Finally, there was tz'dakah ; giving to the poor and to good causes, though not required, was expected and was considered a matter of moral justice and not mere benevolence. What survives in the New Covenant of these three today is not a requirement of law, but rather the principle of giving to God's work and to those in need. One sometimes hears that tithing to one's church or synagogue is required , and that is not right. One also sometimes hears that tithing to one's church or synagogue today is no longer appropriate , and that is not right either. The reason I can espouse these seemingly contradictory things is that, like many things of the Mosaic Law, certain of its principles find their way into the New Covenant, while the particulars and the enforcement mechanisms of the Mosaic Law do not. There is no true comparison of our congregational sanctuaries today to that of the Tabernacle
    and Temple, except that they are (as the Tabernacle and Temple were then) places where the believing community goes periodically to meet God in prayer and worship, mediated through priests and a High Priest. Years ago they were the Levitical priests and Aaron was the High Priest, but now we (the priesthood of believers) are the priests, and Yeshua our Messiah is the High Priest. There is another similarity of "then and now" in that both institutions - the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and the synagogue - have expenses of upkeep. In Mosaic times the expenses included maintaining the Levites, and today it includes mortgage payments on our buildings, and the salaries of clergy and other employees. Whereas tithes and offerings were prescribed by the Mosaic Law for maintaining the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and its priests, we have no such law today but each institution today (synagogues, apostolic networks, etc.) prescribes the way(s) that its members will maintain it. 1 In denominational
    synagogues, support of the institution is usually through membership fees and charging for High Holy Day seats, and in Christian churches and Messianic Synagogues it is usually through members paying ten percent tithes on their income - a logical adaptation of the Mosaic Law. As for special offerings and tz'dakah , they are as needed today as in the past because membership fees and tithes cannot take care of every need. Messianic communities take up "freewill" offerings to cover such needs, and members of the traditional Jewish community often consider that charitable giving ( tz'dakah ) of ten percent is their minimum moral obligation. 1. In church history, a justification for enforced tithing by state churches has analogized elders to priests, and shamashim (deacons) to Levites.
  classical_commentators: The mitzvot compiled by Maimonides and Chinuch included the commandments of giving tithes, offerings and tz'dakah , whereas Meir wrote very little on the subjects - a reflection (no doubt) of today's denominational synagogues choosing to not use tithes as their mainstay of support.

  commandment: We are to be fruitful and multiply in number and in fruitfulness.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The first part of Genesis 1:28 states: " God blessed them: God said to them, ''Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth ...'' " Notice that the commandment to "be fruitful" in Genesis 1:28 comes before the command to "multiply," and that the rest of the verse: and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and every living creature that crawls on the earth. instructs us that we have an obligation to produce value from our multiplied numbers - in other words, disseminate our fruitfulness. The agricultural analogy is that fruit comes first and contains the seeds from which reproduction or multiplication of the plant occurs. Then, the more multiplication the more the fruit, so it is an unending cycle. We see God''s expectation that we multiply (increase) in fruitfulness elsewhere in Scripture as well. In Genesis 35:10-11 , for example, God repeats his commandment to Israel (Jacob) to multiply, but God also says that a nations and kings will be descended
    from him, implying that Israel''s descendants will have functions to fulfill with their numbers. Of course we know from Exodus 19:6 that one of the areas of Israel''s fruitfulness is that it is destined to " be a kingdom of cohanim " - " a nation set apart. " In Acts 9:31 , when we are told that the Messianic Community multiplied in number, it is not to inform us of their reproductive fertility, but of the fact that belief in Yeshua spread throughout the area. Similarly, Colossians 1:6 speaks of the Good News " being fruitful and multiplying ", and Colossians 1:10 speaks of " being fruitful in every good work and multiplying in the full knowledge of God. " It appears clear that God''s desire for Israel and for all of mankind is that we multiply (increase) in both number and fruitfulness. Now a word about reproduction and marriage. The Genesis commandment to multiply was given after man was created to be male and female, but prior to God having made Eve ( Genesis 2:18-24 ). Although reproduction
    was not mentioned in the context of marriage, after God made Eve, He caused her and Adam to become "one flesh" ( verse 24 ) and, since then, God intended reproduction between man and woman to be only in the context of covenant marriage. Reproduction is so implicitly part of the marriage covenant, that a party who refuses to bear children against the wishes of his or her mate may well be ruled to have abandoned the marriage covenant. The controversy regarding the use of birth control measures by consenting married persons cannot be definitively resolved within this Mitzvah . I do, however, express my opinion that methods of birth control that do not kill or abort fetuses are permitted because (1) Scripture allows unmarried persons to avoid having children by remaining single ( Matthew 9:12 ; 1 Corinthians 7:8 ), and (2) in Paul''s warning to married persons that they should not deprive each other of sexual relations ( 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 ), the reason he gives is not that deprivation
    violates a commandment to reproduce, but rather " because of your lack of self-control, you may succumb to the Adversary''s temptation. " 1 And then, Paul follows up in verse 6 with: " I am giving you this as a suggestion, not as a command. " I deduce from this that since agreed-to abstinence between married persons is not a sin, so neither is preventing conception through other non-lethal means. Finally, Genesis 1:28 requires that mankind, as a species, reproduce, but it does not command that all persons or couples reproduce. Certainly unmarried persons should not, persons with certain medical conditions cannot, and there may be some that God specifically calls to remain unmarried ( 1 Corinthians 7:8 ). 1. See also, Exodus 21:7-11 (Maimonides RN262; Meir MN42; Chinuch C46)'
  classical_commentators: In his mitzvah RP212, Maimonides states that we are to marry in order to multiply, and he cites Yebamoth 65b of the Talmud to support his assertion that the duty to be fruitful and multiply applies to men and not women. Meir does not state that it is only the man's duty, but implies it by framing his mitzvah MP43 to address only the man. HaChinuch is consistent with Maimonides and Meir and also cites Yebamoth 6 . None of the classical commentators treat being fruitful and multiplying as other than marrying and reproducing.

  commandment: We are to honor and revere our father and mother.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: Honoring our father and mother involves respecting them for their parental position both privately and in public. It also implies obeying them when we are young, but never in a way that disobeys or dishonors God. Although, by promising long life in the land, it is clear that Exodus 20:12 and Ephesians 6:1-3 are addressing Israelites, the instructions they convey are morally universal and are therefore appplicable for Gentiles as well. The King James Version of the Bible translates " tira'u " (derived from " yara ") in Leviticus 19:3 as " Ye shall fear ", whereas other versions translate the word "revere" or "respect". We are not to be frightened by our parents (that is not the kind of "fear" of them we are to have). We are rather to regard them with awesome respect, for God holds them accountable to train us up in righteousness ( Proverbs 22:6 ), and He holds us accountable for how we treat them - how we speak of them, and how we speak to them. We are not to usurp their
    authority, speak for them (unless asked), contradict them before others in a way that would cause them embarrassment or dishonor and, of course, not curse them or strike them. Our obligation to honor and revere God ( Proverbs 3:9 ; Leviticus 24:15 ; Deuternomy 6:13 ) 4 , and it is incumbent upon us, even should they do wrong to us or follow ungodly paths in aspects of their personal lives. The relevance of 1 Timothy 5:8 is that providing materially for one's parents, especially when they are at an advanced age, is one way of honoring and revering them, and not supporting them when there is a need to do so is the opposite. It is commonly thought that 1 Timothy 5:8 is only a reference to husbands supporting their wives and children, but the context in the ancient world (as well as in many places in the world today) included one's parents, because aging parents commonly lived with (or close by) their children. This principle is verified in Meir's commentary to his mitzvah MP41. 4. Similar
    to the King James Version's translation of "tira'u" in Leviticus 19:3 , most translators of Deuteronomy 6:13 translate "tira" (also derived from "yara") as "fear".
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch have not combined honoring and revering parents into a single mitzvah . Instead, they wrote separate mitzvot for each, the combined essence of which agrees entirely with this Mitzvah . In regard to honoring our parents, all three make reference to places in the Talmud , most prominently, tractate Kiddushin , and also to the Sifra ( Leviticus 19:3 ) 5 . Maimonides adds that we are required to care for our parents when they become old; Meir agrees and goes into some detail of our obligation to financially support our parents when necessary. He further says that we are to attend our father as a servant would attend his master, but we are not to sin in following our parents' instructions. In regard to revering our parents, all three commentators link reverence to fear, and instruct against standing or sitting in one's father's place. Meir says that we are not to contradict our father's words or refer to him by his name. HaChinuch is detailed
    in other ways, and raises the question of how far reverence of parents should go. He indicates that we must be able to suffer indignities and wrongs done to us without putting our parents to shame, and we must be respectful of them even if their minds become deranged in connection with their age. Of course, we are not to curse them or strike them. 5. Halachic midrash to Leviticus.

  commandment: We are to obey the biblical laws concerning marriage.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is derived primarily from Genesis 2:24 : This is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his wife, and they are to be one flesh. 1 The resulting "one flesh" is what makes the leaving and cleaving covenantal, and the fact that the commandment appears so early in Genesis is why I call it a "creation" covenant (to distinguish it from other covenants that came later). We commonly call this covenant "marriage". You will notice that several of the Scriptures from the Tanakh cited above are labeled "obsolete". That is because circumstances and conditions today are so different than during the time of Moses. Back then, the Scriptures that are now obsolete made perfect sense and could be implemented, while today they cannot. Although this Mitzvah is expressed as a "man" leaving his parents to join with his wife, the covenant of becoming "one flesh" cannot be fulfilled unless the man''s intended wife similarly leaves her parents. The "leaving"
    of parents in the Scripture is not a reference to where the couple resides. The Scripture is speaking of the controlling influence that parents rightly have over their young unmarried children, but which is improper and interfering if it is allowed to continue once the child (man or woman) becomes married. I believe the reason Genesis 2:24 reads the way it does, is that a man''s responsibility to leave his parents is different from a woman''s. It is the man''s responsibility to take the initiative in leaving, but it is the woman''s parents'' responsibility to release her to her intended husband. The implication of her parents not doing so is, of course, obvious and, after marriage, problems result when either or both of the marrieds allow improper ties to their parents to continue. The concept of becoming "one flesh" is not only covenantal, but also mystical and difficult to comprehend. Mark 10:8b attempts to explain it by stating: Thus they are no longer two, but one. Ephesians 5:29-32
    relates the phenomenon to Messiah and the Body of Believers by stating: Why, no one ever hated his own flesh! On the contrary, he feeds it well and takes care of it, just as the Messiah does the Messianic Community, because we are parts of his Body. "Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and remain with his wife, and the two will become one." There is profound truth hidden here, which I say concerns the Messiah and the Messianic Community. This "oneness" possibly reminds one of the plural unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Genesis 2:24 has been interpreted, in some quarters, as requiring everyone to marry. I do not view it that way, especially in light of Paul''s remarks in 1 Corinthians 7:8, 32-35 . I believe that Scripture teaches that the norm of creation is to marry and procreate, but it allows for not doing so and, in some cases, singleness is God''s will for an individual (see Matthew 19:12 ). This Mitzvah includes Scriptures that prohibit marriage to certain
    persons. These include family members with whom we cannot have sexual relations, persons with whom we are unequally yoked, Jews marrying persons of certain nations, etc. It also includes persons that a cohen cannot marry. Secular law also puts restrictions on marrying family members in order to avoid weakening the human genetic pool and allowing unwanted recessive traits to emerge. 1. Some translations state "cleave" to his wife.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch make no reference to Genesis 2:24 (or any other Scripture) to support leaving one''s father and mother and becoming one flesh with one''s wife when one marries. Maimonides'' RP213, Meir''s MP44, and HaChinuch''s C552, rely on Deuteronomy 24:1 to support their allegation that marriage must be by kiddushin (consecration) - a binding marriage ceremony. The Scripture does not say that, nor does any other Scripture. Maimonides and HaChinuch refer to Exodus 21:11 , and Meir refers to Deuteronomy 24:1 to support their general law of marriage, but I find all three commentators ambiguous as to whether their respective mitzvot command marriage or simply describe the kiddushin (sanctification), of a marriage ceremony. Apparently, Rabbi Dr. Charles B. Chavel, a prominent translator into English of Maimonides'' " Sefer HaMitzvot " had the same concern, for he found it necessary to introduce the bracketed word [only] in the first sentence of his
    mitzvah RP213, causing it to read: By this injunction we are commanded to take a woman to wife [only] by a binding ceremony: either by giving her something [of value] 2 , or by handing her a writ of marriage, or by intercourse [accompanied by a declaration of marriage]. Meir discusses kiddushin through the payment of monetary value, and he also discusses betrothal before nissuin (consummation) but not the other ways of consecrating a marriage. HaChinuch presents the most detail of kiddushin . He states that if marriage is consecrated by the giving of monetary value, the groom must say: "You are now consecrated to me by this money (or thing of monetary value)." If the marriage is consecrated by a document, the groom must say: "You are consecrated to me by this document (or whatever it is)." If marriage is consecrated by sexual intercourse, he must say to his bride before witnesses: "You are consecrated to me by this act of intimacy." He then takes his bride into seclusion and is seen
    doing so by the witnesses. 2. The modern equivalent of paying the bride money is for the groom to give the bride a wedding ring of significant monetary value while stating: "You are hereby consecrated to me with this ring, according to the law of Moses and Israel." It is analogous to a "bride price" practiced in certain other cultures, and opposite to a "dowry" which the bride or the bride''s father is expected to pay to the groom.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The biblical covenant of marriage consists of one man and one woman joined together to become "one flesh." On one level, "one flesh" is a mystical concept that is difficult to understand but, on a practical level, it defines marriage as being a covenant of exclusive intimacy between lifelong partners, most of whom will produce offspring. We do not profess to know why God allowed men to have multiple wives during the Mosaic and pre-Mosaic periods, but it seems not to have been God''s best for us from the beginning ( Genesis 2:24 and Ephesians 5:31 ), and it is clearly not his will for us today, as Scripture applies it to elders in 1 Timothy 3:2a & 12 and Titus 1:6a . According to Malachi 2:13-16 , God hates divorce. He instructed the Israelites to not abandon their marriage covenants through "breaking faith" - a reference to sexual infidelity in marriage. Although sexual infidelity (e.g. adultery) is the only ground for a believer to divorce another believer, it is
    not the only way to violate one''s covenant of marriage; any abandonment or desertion is a violation but, except for the abandonment of adultery, the violation does not release the innocent spouse to seek a decree of divorce from his or her believing spouse. Abandonment most often means physically leaving, but there are other ways to abandon a spouse. Committing adultery is one such abandonment, but so is physical abuse, emotional abuse, child abuse, refusing to engage in sexual intimacy, refusing to provide financial support, exposing one''s family to unnecessary danger, etc. Wrongful as these are, they are not - except for adultery - grounds for a believer to seek a divorce from another believer. Before going further, let us define some terms that are used here. "Violating" one''s covenant of marriage means doing something that is contrary to the terms of the covenant, but no violation in itself automatically ends a covenant of marriage. A violation may be of the kind that allows the
    innocent party to take steps to end the covenant by pursuing a decree of "divorce" (adultery), but the innocent party may choose to overlook or forgive even the most serious transgression and continue in the marriage as before. No violation provides grounds for the guilty party to "create facts of the ground" in order to initiate ending the covenant. The biblical law of divorce may be (and usually is) different from the secular law of nation states. Indeed, the very meaning of the word "divorce" is subject to a number of interpretations and, rather than discuss each of them, we have set forth our view, and invite the reader to reach his or her own conclusions. There is no single Hebrew or Greek noun in the biblical texts for "divorce" as there is in English. The underlying Hebrew noun for "divorce" is " sefer k''riytut ", and the equivalent Greek noun is " biblion apostasion ", - both meaning "decree of divorce", "bill of divorcement", or " get ". The Hebrew and Greek nouns respectively
    translated "divorce" do not have the same meaning as does the English noun. In English, when one speaks of "a divorce", one is referring to a legal action that terminates a marriage. In the Bible, however, the above Hebrew and Greek words that are typically translated "divorce" do not terminate anything - rather, they formally document that which has occurred, which is that one or both of the spouses have abandoned their marriage covenant through un-covenantal conduct, and the innocent spouse has declared the marriage ended. So for example, a get (a Jewish decree of divorce) is legal confirmation that a marriage has ended, but it does not itself end the covenant. The covenant is dissolved the way it was made - through the words of the parties - in this case, by the innocent party. A consequence of this is, therefore, even if an innocent spouse obtains a get , if it has been obtained for a biblically unauthorized reason, the get is void ab initio , the marriage remains intact, and any
    party that marries or remarries in reliance on the invalid get commits adultery. Whenever a verse of Scripture says that a divorced (and remarried) party is an adulterer or has committed adultery by virtue of a remarriage, such a thing is logically possible only if he or she is still married to the original spose at the time that the remarriage occurred. Matthew 5:31-32 , Matthew 19:9 and Luke 16:18 are examples of this; they state: It was said, ''Whoever divorces his wife must give her a get.'' But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, makes her an adulteress; and that anyone who marries a divorcee commits adultery. 1 ( Matthew 5:31-32 ) Now what I say to you is that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery! ( Matthew 19:9 ) Every man who divorces his wife and marries [in order to marry] another woman commits adultery, and a man who marries a woman divorced by her husband
    commits adultery. ( Luke 16:18 ) Matthew 5:31-32 seems to be making an adulteress out of an innocent wife. Although she has not committed adultery, she somehow becomes an adulteress by virtue of her husband having divorced her on an invalid ground. How can that be so? The explanation for this can be deduced from what we have previously said about a decree of divorce - that it does not break a marriage covenant in and of itself. Also, whereas the above Scriptures appear to infer that only husbands can initiate divorce, later Scriptures such as Mark 10:11-12 infer that a wife may do so as well. Luke 16:18 and Mark 10:11-12 , as commonly translated, appear to be saying that anyone who divorces and re-marries commits adultery. This can only be true if the divorce is invalid so, in what circumstance might the divorce referred to be invalid? I am of the opinion that the Scriptures are speaking of divorces that are obtained for the explicit purpose of marrying another, and so they might rightly
    read: Every man who divorces his wife [in order to marry] another woman commits adultery, and a man who marries a woman divorced by her husband commits adultery (Luke 16:18). and He said to them, ''Whoever divorces his wife [in order to marry] another woman commits adultery against his wife; and if a wife divorces her husband [in order to marry] another man, she too commits adultery'' (Mark 10:11-12). As indicated previously, a get does not, in and of itself, break the marriage covenant. Therefore, if Spouse A procures a get against Spouse B on a ground that is not biblically authorized, their marriage covenant remains intact despite the invalid get . If either spouse (let''s say Spouse B) then marries another (and presumably has sexual relations with that other) in reliance on the invalid get , he or she and the new spouse (Spouse C) are momentarily in adultery, and their attempt at marriage is ineffective because the unauthorized get did not end the first marriage. The cohabitation
    of Spouse B and C therefore comprises adultery and/or fornication, and a new ground is thus created for A to seek a divorce against B - this time on a biblically valid ground. If and when that is done, the impediment to the marriage between B and C is removed, and their marriage becomes legitimized automatically. The lesson in all of this is (1) do not seek to divorce in the first place, and (2) if you find yourself with a court-ordered decree of divorce regardless of who procured it or what court it is from, do not remarry unless the decree was obtained on biblically allowed grounds. A heavy burden is placed on an innocent marriage partner who has an improper decree of divorce forced on him or her by a spouse that does not remarry or commit adultery in some other way. Under these circumstances, any get that is obtained does not end the marriage, and the innocent party, although abandoned and in possession of a get is not, at the moment, released to obtain his or her own get and remarry.
    There is, however, a biblical remedy for this; it is for the innocent spouse to lodge a complaint against the abandoning spouse pursuant to Matthew 18:15-17 which states: Moreover, if your brother [in this case sister in Messiah] commits a sin against you, go and show him his fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother. If he doesn''t listen, take one or two others with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to hear them, tell the congregation; and if he refuses to listen even to the congregation, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector [i.e. an unbeliever]. If the complaining spouse follows the aforesaid sequence of steps and, in the midst of it (or after its completion) the abandoning spouse (who has not remarried) repents, remarries his spouse and returns to his spouse to fulfill the marriage covenant by mutual consent, then all is well. If, however,
    he or she does not repent and a bet din 2 rules that he or she should be treated as an unbeliever pursuant to Matthew 18:17 , then 1 Corinthians 7:15 can be invoked by the innocent spouse, which said Scripture states: But if the unbelieving spouse separates himself, let him be separated. In circumstances like these, the brother or sister is not enslaved - God has called you to a life of peace. This Scripture enables the innocent spouse to petition for a a writ of divorce in a public court and, if obtained, the marriage is declared to be over, and both parties are officially released to remarry. It might seem unfair that the party who is in the wrong is equally free to remarry but that is, nevertheless, the case. Although the Scriptures seem to make adultery the only ground for which a believer can sue his or her believing spouse for a get , the adjudication of other sins of abandonment using the Matthew 18 process can, nevertheless, result in a get being granted provided the offending
    spouse is found by a bet din to be unrepentant and is ordered to be treated as an unbeliever ( verse 17 ). In such a case, 1 Corinthians 7:15 may be invoked against the unbelieving spouse that has been adjudicated to be unrepentant: But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage [the bond of matrimony has been broken] in such cases. But God has called us to peace. The unbelieving spouse''s continued lack of repentance justifies the conclusion that the unbeliever has departed. We would be remiss were we not to remind the reader that 2 Corinthians 6:14 warns against a believer covenanting with an unbeliever: Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers. For how can righteousness and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have with darkness? What harmony can there be between the Messiah and B''liya''al? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement can there be between the temple of God and idols?
    For we are the temple of the living God - as God said, "I will house myself in them ... and I will walk among you. I will be their God, and they will be my people. The reason is obvious in that believers and unbelievers (by definition) walk according to different beliefs and values. They will eventually pull in against each other causing conflict, or the believer will compromise his or her values in order to keep the peace. 1. " anyone who marries a divorcee commits adultery " refers to a divorcee whose marriage remains valid. 2. A bet din is a Jewish ecclesiastical court whose judges generally consist of elders, and where rules of due process apply. There are Christian counterparts of such a court in Roman Catholicism and certain other Christian denominations, and the important thing to keep in mind is that their rulings are often at odds with those of secular courts because, even when both courts have jurisdiction over the subject matter (e.g. divorce) and the litigating parties, they
    are bound by different laws. Some hold the position that, anyone that wishes to seek a decree of divorce against his or her spouse, must do so twice (once in each kind of court) in order to fulfill both biblical and secular requirements (see 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 ). That is the Orthodox Jewish view. My view is that if one first obtains a get from a bet din , one must follow it up with a secular divorce in order to be free to remarry in our society. However, if one obtains a secular divorce on a biblical ground (e.g. adultery), because the ground produces the same result in both courts, it is my opinion that one does not need to repeat the process in a bet din ; the secular court''s decree of divorce will suffice.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'' and HaChinuch''s mitzvot , RP222 and C579, respectively, state that a divorce can only be acquired through the issuance of a writ ( get ), and Meir did not write a corresponding mitzvah on the subject. All three commentators wrote mitzvot acknowledging that Scripture prohibits a man from remarrying his divorced wife if she has remarried in the interim, and all three prohibit a man from divorcing his wife if he subjected her to false accusations that besmirched her character, or acquired his wife after stealing her virginity. They also state that a divorce can only be acquired through the issuance of a writ ( get ). They did not discuss or write mitzvot about the marriage covenant per se. Addendum by Daniel C. Juster Two Evangelical scholars, William Luck (formally a professor at Moody Bible Institute) and David Instone-Brewer, have sought to broaden the biblical grounds for divorce through books each has written. Luck''s treatment of divorce expands
    the meaning of abandoning marriage (re: 1 Corinthians 7 ) to the idea of the spouse - especially the man - not fulfilling the biblical requirements for basic covenant. Instone-Brewer references Luck''s work and expands on it with his vast Talmudic knowledge. Luck''s basic idea is that Yeshua''s exception clause is basically a rejection of the "any-cause" divorce idea, and a reaffirmation of the primary reason for divorce, which is marital unfaithfulness. Instone-Brewer, on the other hand, seeks to show, through much "Second Temple Judaism" scholarship, that unfaithfulness does not only mean adultery, but should be interpreted in terms of four requirements for marriage which first apply to the husband but, by extension, also partially apply to the wife. According to the texts of the Torah , the husband is to bring faithfulness to the marriage to not commit adultery (fornicate with another), to give the wife her conjugal rights, to provide sustenance (food and shelter), and lastly to not
    physically abuse her. Just as a slave goes free who is beaten to the extent of bodily injury, so is physical abuse of a spouse grounds for divorce. Failure to provide any of these four "requirements of marriage" amounts to basic unfaithfulness. Strangely, after making a strong case for the fourfold meaning of unfaithfulness and grounding it in first century Judaism and more, Brewer misses a central point of Dr. Rudolph''s scholarship in this Mitzvah , which is the requirement that a get (writ of divorce) must be issued by a legitimate court of elders that has the authority over the subject matter and the parties. The depth of Instone-Brewer''s Jewish scholarship is very good, so it is astonishing that he misses this, and can see believers acting in accordance with their individual consciences in determining when the lines of fidelity have been sufficiently crossed, so as to allow them a secular divorce. Rather, the biblical teaching is that no such divorce (with the allowance of remarriage)
    can be validated without a written get . Matthew 16 and Matthew 18 provide for this authority to be vested in the leadership of Yeshua''s Kehillah . Regarding the fourfold meaning of unfaithfulness and its connection to 1 Corinthians 7 , my evaluation of Instone-Brewer is that he makes a convincing case, but that it is not fully proven. While I am loathe to open up greater grounds for divorce in our era of easy divorces and remarriages, I think courts of elders should study evidence that is presented by a complainant seeking to divorce, and decide whether to issue a get based upon what they conclude are biblical grounds. Also, the more equal way to judge divorce cases, is to consider that either the husband or the wife can breach the marriage covenant.'

  commandment: We are forbidden to afflict our wife by withholding food, clothing, or marital rights.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: It is clear from the totality of the Scriptures (and especially from the New Covenant Scriptures), that the overarching commandment is for men to love their wives. The particulars of this Mitzvah in singling out food, clothing, and marital (conjugal sexual) rights is forced upon us because it is treated that way by the classical commentators, and we felt that we should respond accordingly. Many Scriptures address men but are clearly applicable to both men and women. We understand that wives are to love their husbands but the responsibility of this Mitzvah is directed specifically to husbands.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch use Exodus 21:9-10 to support their mitzvot that we must not withhold food, clothing, or marital rights from our wives. The context of the Scripture that they use to support their mitzvot is that of a wife who was previously a slave, marries her master, and the master subsequently marries for a second time when his first wife no longer pleases him.

  commandment: We are to care for and not mistreat children.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: Generally, the statement of the Mitzvah speaks for itself, and the only controversy about it has to do with the administration of spankings. The well-known saying "spare the rod and spoil the child" is often mistakenly attributed to Scripture, but its origin is actually a 17 th century poem by Samuel Butler titled "Hudibras", which has nothing to do with Scripture. Nevertheless, Proverbs 13:24 and Proverbs 22:15 speak similarly, and have been the subject of law suits and prosecutions promulgated by some in our society who believe that spanking a child for correction is cruel and abusive. In oppositional response to that, much has been written on how to administer a spanking with love that is truly corrective.
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the classical Jewish commentators.

  commandment: We are to believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: Belief in the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is not only belief in His existence, but in the fact that He is the God who brought us out of Egypt and is our only God ( Exodus 20:2 ). Also, Scripture teaches that believing in God is connected to trusting God, since one cannot trust in whom one does not believe. In order to emphasize the equivalence of belief and trust, several of the above Scriptures are rendered in two reputable translations - the NKJ that speaks of belief, and the CJB that speaks of trust in their handling the same Scriptures.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch concur that Exodus 20:2 is a Scripture that, by implication, commands that we believe in God. The rationale for this is God's own statement that He is our God, and the supreme means of our having been brought out of the slavery of Egypt. To believe, therefore, that God is God, one has to trust His Word that He is whom He says He is, thereby illustrating the inseparability of belief and trust. Meir makes another cogent point by stating that belief in God is the foundation of Jewish faith, and anyone who does not believe in God has no place among the Jewish people.

  commandment: We are not to approach God in prayer or worship while we are unrepentant of our sins.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: In the Mosaic Covenant, an Israelite would bring his animal sacrifice to the Temple (or the Tabernacle), and a Levitical cohen would assist him by slaying it, placing it on an altar, and offering it up to God in his behalf. The Israelite had to be ceremonially clean (i.e. ritually pure) to even enter the Temple's sanctuary, but whether or not he was actually repentant (i.e. the condition of his heart was right) when he offered his sacrifice was known only to God. There is another Mosaic Covenant example of the need to approach God only when repentant, and that is Leviticus 16:11 's requirement that the High Priest sacrifice a bull for himself prior to sacrificing a goat for the sins of Israel on Yom Kippur . We also assume that the ten days between Yom T'ruah and Yom Kippur was for the purpose of all Israelites examining themselves and repenting of their sins (committed during the previous year) prior to their coming before the Lord on Yom Kippur . The various commandments
    requiring that the worshiper be ceremonially clean in order to enter the Holy Temple were, no doubt, given in order to remind him of God's holiness, and that the house in which God chose to put His Name (i.e. where the Sh'khinah dwelt) must not be defiled. One thing is certain however - the worshipper's sacrifice was only acceptable if his heart was repentant before God ( Genesis 4:3-7 ; Isaiah 1:15-19, 59:1-2 ; Matthew 5:23-24 ). The Temple that stood in Jerusalem was built of brick and mortar but, in this era of the New Covenant, God's presence (The Holy Spirit) lives in Temples made of flesh (the "bodies" of believers) and, therefore, in the "bodies" of each and every one of us who will have Him ( 1 Corinthians 3:16-17, 6:19-20 ). That gives new meaning to the requirement that God's Temple be undefiled. Today, the commandment has not to do with entering a physical Temple while in an unclean state; rather, it is allowing the Temple of our bodies to fall into a spiritually unclean state,
    thereby making it uninhabitable by the Holy Spirit. Spiritual uncleanliness is caused by sin, and it persists if there is no repentance. Our need for spiritual cleanness and repentance is illustrated by several Scriptures (listed above) that essentially state that God does not have fellowship with, nor does He even hear, those who are unrepentant of their sin (see Proverbs 15:29 ; Isaiah 59:1-2 ; 1 Corinthians 11:27-29 ; and James 5:16 ).
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides and HaChinuch wrote mitzvot #RN77 and #C363 respectively, which state that no person who is ceremonially unclean is to enter the Sanctuary. Maimonides and HaChinuch do not offer mitzvot on spiritual cleanness broadly, and Meir is silent on both subjects.'

  commandment: We are to be thankful to God and bless Him in all things.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: It should be apparent from the many Scriptures quoted above, that both the Tanakh and the Kitvey B'rit Chadasha enjoin us to be thankful to God, giving thanks to Him who created all and who continues to provide for our every need. There exists, however, only one place in the Torah that specifically commands thankfulness - Deuteronomy 8:6-18 , verse 10 , which is the basis for the traditional Grace after Meals, the Birkat Hamazon . Notwithstanding that single occurrence, being thankful and giving thanks to God are deeply ingrained in Judaism and in Jewish practice. They are addressed in various places in the Talmud (e.g. in B'rakhot and Avot ), and appear in the Siddur as the first blessing that is said upon awakening ( Modeh Ani ), as the next-to-last benediction of the Sh'moneh Esreh (" Modim anachnu lach ... "), and as the central theme of the Aleinu prayer (" Va'anachnu korim umishtachavim umodim "). They are also implicit in the multitude of blessings that begin
    " Baruch atah adonai, eloheynu melech ha-olam ... " ("Blessed are you Lord, our God, King of the universe, who ..."). There are essentially two ways in which we can bless God. The first is by expressing thankful praise to Him for the blessings He bestows on us. It may be emoted spontaneously or recited ritually in what is termed a " b'rakhah ". The second way is by loving Him as our Heavenly Father, Messiah savior, and Holy Spirit, and by fulfilling His highest expectation of us, which is to be unswervingly obedient to His Word and to walk in His ways. The totality of Scripture makes it plain that our being thankful to God and our blessing Him should not be only for His provision of food, but for all of His provisions and blessings that He bestows upon us, not the least of which is His unconditional love. There is therefore a deeper way to understand and employ the Birkat Hamazon than as merely "grace after meals". It is that, in the fullness of our having eaten, we should allow its
    words to permeate our soul while contemplating our blessings, and thankfully remembering that God is our provider and sustainer, and not we ourselves.
  classical_commentators: None of the commentators (Maimonides, Meir, or HaChinuch) wrote general mitzvot commanding that we be thankful to God. That is no doubt because they only sought to codify commandments they found in the Torah , and concluded that Deuteronomy 8:10 is the only Scripture in the Torah that commands thankfulness. Two English translations for Deuteronomy 8:10 are included in the Scripture list above. None of the commentators worked in the English language, of course, but the way the New King James Version translates Deuteronomy 8:10 must have been close to how all three of them understood the Hebrew. I conclude this because all three of their mitzvot command that we bless God after we have eaten a meal (i.e. say Grace). Although the context of the Scripture is the Israelites having come into the Promised Land, Maimonides, Meir, HaChinuch and all of Judaism interpret it broadly to mean that, after we have eaten and are satisfied, we are to remember God who brought us out
    of Egypt. That is the purpose of the Birkat Hamazon . Meir states that we are also to bless God before eating. Using the logic of kal va-chomer (less to more), he states that if we are to bless God when we are satisfied, how much more is our obligation to bless him when we are hungry. The logic seems a little backwards, but that is his logic. As with thanking God, none of the commentators wrote mitzvot on "blessing God" either.

  commandment: We are to have faith in God & trust Him for all things - for our protection, for those we love, for our worldly needs, and for our very lives.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah commands us to have faith in God and trust Him for all things. Faith and trust are at the very heart of our relationship with God, so it is no wonder that there are so many Scriptures in the Bible that speak to it. Many Scriptures address it directly, and it is also built into the Jewish life experience through the Sh''mitah , the Year of Jubilee, and the various Sabbaths that require that we rest ourselves and/or our land, cancel debts, and return our land to its original owners every fifty years. All of these require that we put ourselves in God''s hands and trust Him to provide for us and protect us. Scripturally, there is no difference between faith and trust as we may see from the following two translations of Hebrews 11:1 : CJB: Trusting is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about things we do not see. NKJ: Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. This connection of trust and faith to our not seeing
    is vitally important. When we exercise faith, it is not only that we do not see God; that is always the case. It is that we do not see or understand the circumstance or the issue for which we trust Him, and we must therefore make ourselves vulnerable to Him and rely solely on Him. The extent to which we do that betrays how discipled we are. If we are new in the Lord, we likely give ourselves over to Him periodically and on a case by case basis. The ideal, however, is that our walk with God is one of continuous reliance and continuous trust as it appears was the case with Enoch in Genesis 5:24 : Hanokh [Enoch] walked with God, and then he wasn''t there, because God took him.'
  classical_commentators: 'Despite the plethora of Scriptures on trust and faith, Maimonides, Meir and HaChinuch did not construct any mitzvot specifically on the subject. Nevertheless, Maimonides separately wrote his famous "Thirteen Basic Principles of Faith" that list what we are to believe about God apart from our having natural evidence: 1. God exists. 2. God is one. 3. God is incorporeal 4. God is eternal 5. Only God may be worshipped 6. Prophets exist who hear God''s voice 7. Moses was the chief of the prophets 8. The entire Torah was given to Moses from heaven 9. The Torah is perfect and we must therefore not add nor subtract from it 10. God is omniscient 11. God rewards and punishes 12. The Messiah will come, and we should not try to predict when 13. There is a resurrection from the dead'

  commandment: We are to dedicate ourselves to God through Messiah.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'God has always required that mankind worship and obey Him, which is a form of dedication. Nevertheless, from very early times, God chose certain men to dedicate 3 their lives to Him in a special way. Sometimes God imposed it on them and sometimes it was voluntary. Sometimes they were referred to as priests, but not always. Let''s start with God''s covenant with Abraham. The Scriptures show that there was a voluntary relationship between Abraham and God, but there came a time when God gave Abraham a covenant that was not voluntary on Abraham''s part. The covenant had several components to it, but the bottom line was that Abraham and his descendants were to be dedicated to God for special service. We know this because, by the time of Moses, God was referring to the children of Israel (Israelites) as a " kingdom of cohanim for me, a nation set apart " ( Exodus 19:6 ). But God went further than that, and commanded that the firstborn of every Israelite and every animal
    within the camp of Israel must be dedicated to His service: Exodus 13:1-2 ADONAI said to Moshe, "Set aside for me all the firstborn. Whatever is first from the womb among the people of Isra''el, both of humans and of animals, belongs to me. Then God reversed Himself. He ordered that all the firstborn of the Israelites be redeemed from their service, and He dedicated Aaron and his sons (from the tribe of Levi) to be priests instead: Numbers 3:10a You are to appoint Aharon and his sons to carry out the duties of cohanim And He dedicated the rest of the Levites to serve Aaron and his sons in carrying out their priestly functions: Numbers 3:9 Assign the L''vi''im to Aharon and his sons; their one responsibility in regard to the people of Isra''el is to serve him. Numbers 3:11-12 ADONAI said to Moshe, "I have taken the L''vi''im from among the people of Isra''el in lieu of every firstborn male that is first from the womb among the people of Isra''el; the L''vi''im are to be mine." All of
    the dedications referred to up to now were imposed dedications; they were not voluntary. But there came a time when God allowed a very special kind of dedication that could be either imposed or volunteered for, and those who were so dedicated were called "Nazirites". The voluntary Nazirite vow of dedication was normally for a specified season, after which the person who took the vow was released. The law of the Nazirite is partially as follows: Numbers 6:2-8 Tell the people of Isra''el, ''When either a man or a woman makes a special kind of vow, the vow of a nazir, consecrating himself to ADONAI; he is to abstain from wine and other intoxicating liquor, he is not to drink vinegar from either source, he is not to drink grape juice, and he is not to eat grapes or raisins. As long as he remains a nazir he is to eat nothing derived from the grapevine, not even the grape-skins or the seeds. Throughout the period of his vow as a nazir, he is not to shave his head. Until the end of the time
    for which he has consecrated himself to ADONAI he is to be holy: he is to let the hair on his head grow long. Throughout the period for which he has consecrated himself to ADONAI, he is not to approach a corpse. He is not to make himself unclean for his father, mother, brother or sister when they die, since his consecration to God is on his head. Throughout the time of his being a nazir he is holy for ADONAI. Because there are other requirements for the Nazirite that require the Temple and the Levitical priests, it is not possible to become a Nazirite today and, by the grace of God it is not needed any longer. The reason it is not needed is that today, our vow of dedication to Yeshua as Lord of our lives is the New Covenant equivalent of the Nazirite vow and more: Romans 10:8 and 12:1 that if you acknowledge publicly with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and trust in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be delivered ... I exhort you, therefore, brothers, in view of God''s
    mercies, to offer yourselves as a sacrifice, living and set apart for God. This will please him; it is the logical "Temple worship" for you. In the New Covenant, this new way of dedicating ourselves to God is both available to everyone and required of everyone. 3. "Dedicate" and "Consecrate" are interchangeable.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch wrote several mitzvot pertaining to Nazirite vows but wrote none pertaining to any other kind of personal dedication to God. Meir did not address Nazirite vows or matters of dedication at all.
  commentary_juster: Notwithstanding the Nazirite vow's obsolescence, we do occasionally find people who believe that God is asking them to give themselves to Him for a period of special consecration, prayer or other purpose. Sometimes they believe that they are led, as part of that, to emulate the Nazirite vow by giving up wine and other foods such as meat, and to a time of partial liquid (e.g. water) fasting. If done with balance, there should be no objection to special seasons of dedication done in that way.

  commandment: We are to know that God exists and Who God is by observing His creation.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Romans 1:19-20 says that godless and wicked people are without excuse for not knowing God because God''s qualities (His eternal power and divine nature) are clearly seen in "what He has made". What He has made is another way of saying His creation. I am assuming that no one reading this Mitzvah is in the category of being godless and wicked or he would not very likely be reading it, so I will address my following remarks to those who are not yet convinced about God''s existence, and to the rest of us who already know Him, want more of Him, and aspire to His virtues. Since what can be known about God (His existence and His nature) are there for all to see by observing His creation, then we are remiss if we do not seek to observe His creation at every opportunity. But how can Romans 1:19-20 make such a sweeping statement - that everyone, everywhere, can know about God merely by observing His creation? If we were to point to some item of God''s creation and ask a typical
    unbeliever to explain how it could have come about without God, he would very likely respond with the Darwinism he had been taught - that it came about from organic compounds in the oceans that combined and, through natural selection, evolved to its present state. Now to me, the logic of that happening is so implausible as to defy imagination, but not to a person who has been taught that, and that has not yet had a personal encounter with God. I would fare no better were I to show the unbeliever what the Bible says about God because unbelievers do not believe the Bible either. Now the negative picture I have painted does not mean that I should not try, because (1) it is my obligation under the instruction of Matthew 28:16-20 , and (2) the Holy Spirit might anoint my words and make Himself known to the unbeliever at that moment or thereafter, and that, of course, will make all the difference. But whether I see it happen or not, I have an obligation to bring the truth of God (including
    the salvation brought by Yeshua) to the unbeliever at every opportunity. Although I cannot predict when God will come to him, I can nevertheless bring him face-to-face with God through speaking the words of Scripture, and through an effective presentation of God''s creation. But what is an effective presentation? I previously hypothesized an unbeliever who rejected the idea of God''s existence even after I showed him something of God''s creation and challenged him to explain by logic how it could have come about without God. So, that is not the approach I recommend. The approach I recommend is to show Him God''s creation in nature, and draw his attention to its goodness and beauty. Ask him: "Do you see beauty in this tree?" "Do you see beauty in this other tree?" "Do you see beauty in all of these trees?" How come? They are all shaped differently, yet they are all picture-beautiful, and there is nothing about their beauty that has anything to do with their survivability. The unbeliever
    will admit to seeing beauty in the trees I show him because we, being part of God''s creation and having been made in His image, have an instinctive understanding of goodness and beauty. There is no logic to it and there is no usefulness to it. Trees would be just as functional in adding oxygen to the environment, just as useful to nesting birds, and just as survivable in a forest crowded by other trees, if they were ugly instead of beautiful. Darwin''s theory of evolution through natural selection does not explain why the natural world is filled with beauty, and the truth of that will not be lost on the unbeliever. But we ought not to consider this Mitzvah to be only for the unbeliever, because the rest of us (who already know Him) want to (and have a need to) regularly encounter Him, and one of the ways is to observe and contemplate what He has made - His creation, that God Himself said was very good. You have no doubt noticed that, in speaking of God''s creation, I have associated
    goodness with beauty, and have shown you how relying on the beauty of God''s creation can impress an unbeliever and bring him to the place of considering the existence of God and Messiah. Genesis 1:1-31 says that God saw, on five of the six days of creation, that what He had made was "good," and the Hebrew words used for "good" in all five are " ki-tov ". Now although " tov " is very often translated as "good", it is not the only possibility and, in fact the word (and concept of) "good" is quite hard to define. What, for example comprises that which is good? The way something looks? The way it feels? The way it tastes? The way it works? When we consult the prestigious Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew Lexicon 1 for the definition of " tov ", we get all of these possibilities: (1) good; (2) pleasing; (3) delightful; (4) delicious; sweet or savory; (5) pure and clean; (6) cheerful; (7) happy; (8) glad; (9) joyful; (10) kind; (11) acceptable; (12) vigorous; (13) excellent; (14) fair;
    and (15) beautiful. It is this last definition - "beautiful" - that I suggest is a better translation of " tov " in Genesis 1:1-31 , because then the verses of Genesis read: On day 1 God created light, and " God saw that the light was beautiful. " On day 2 God separated sky from water, and on day 3 He created land, the seas, grass, plants, fruit trees and seed-bearing fruit, and " God saw that it was beautiful. " On day 4 God created day and night, seasons, days, years, the sun, the moon and the stars, and " God saw that it was beautiful. " On day 5 God created swimming creatures, birds, sea creatures and creeping creatures, all of which could reproduce, and " God saw that it was beautiful. " On day 6 God created other living creatures, livestock, crawling animals, wild beasts, and man, and " God saw that it was beautiful. " Finally, at the end of day 6 , just before He rested on the Shabbat , " God saw everything that he had made, and indeed it was very beautiful. " Now perhaps you
    are thinking that substituting "beautiful" for "good" as a translation of " tov " is forcing it to suit the purposes of this Mitzvah . Not So! Here are three occurrences in Genesis where a derivative of " tov " is translated as "beautiful" or "attractive" in the NKJ, NIV, NAS, and yes, even in the Jewish Publication Society''s TNK. 2 In the CJB: Genesis 6:2 : " ... the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were attractive " The Hebrew word used for "attractive" is " ki-tovat ". Genesis 24:16 : " The girl was very beautiful, " The Hebrew word used for "beautiful" is " tovat ". Genesis 26:7 : " After all, she is a beautiful woman. " The Hebrew word used for "beautiful" is " ki-tovat ". It is similar in many other Scriptures; for example, in Esther 1:11 , the word for "beautiful" is " ki-tovat ".

  commandment: We are not to blaspheme God; instead we are to receive Him via Messiah & the Holy Spirit.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Blasphemy is communicating disrespect for something that is sacred or someone who is holy. Among believers, we often hear doctrinal statements espoused as though they have nothing or little to do with each other. For example: Blaspheming God is a forgivable sin, whereas blaspheming the Holy Spirit is an unpardonable sin ( Leviticus 24:15-16 ; Matthew 12:32 ). If we believe in our heart and confess with our mouth that Yeshua was raised from the dead we will be saved ( Romans 10:8-9 ). It is necessary that we receive the Holy Spirit in order to receive power and spiritual gifts from on high ( Acts 1:8 ; 1 Corinthians 14:1 ). These sayings are correct, but have we sufficiently considered how they are related to each other, and why they are correct in view of their raising perplexing questions? For example, statement #1 raises the question: "Why is blaspheming the Holy Spirit unforgivable, whereas blaspheming Yeshua or the Father forgivable?" And as to statement #2: "What
    is special about believing in Yeshua as compared to God the Father and the Holy Spirit? Is it not sufficient to believe in God broadly? After all, there are those in the world that have never heard of Yeshua." And a question that may arise regarding statement #3 is: "Why does God single out the Holy Spirit as the conveyer of His power and gifts? Can we not receive God''s power and gifts directly from the Father and Yeshua without the Holy Spirit''s intervention?" The answers to these questions become clearer when we stop thinking of biblical doctrines such as these as standing on their own, and begin to appreciate them as interrelated. As a matter of fact, despite the prominence given in some quarter to sayings #1, #2, and #3, none of them are primary. What is primary and the umbrella for all of them is what is known as the " Sh''ma " - Deuteronomy 6:4-6 as explained by Yeshua in Matthew 22:34-40 : ... but when the P''rushim learned that he had silenced the Tz''dukim, they got together,
    and one of them who was a Torah expert asked a sh''eilah to trap him: "Rabbi, which of the mitzvot in the Torah is the most important?" He told him, "''You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.'' This is the greatest and most important mitzvah. And a second is similar to it, ''You are to love your neighbor as yourself.'' All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on these two mitzvot." We cannot love God with all of our heart, soul and strength unless we know Him intimately, and we cannot know Him intimately unless God reveals Yeshua to us through the Holy Spirit ( John 6:44 ). We cannot know Him by our own knowledge and virtue - even by the Words of Scripture if the Holy Spirit does not first soften our hearts and give us understanding ( Ephesians 2:8-9 ). Then, once God and His nature are revealed to us, we have the choice of whether or not to receive Him. If we do, the Holy Spirit takes up residence in us, we are given
    a new spirit, our hearts become softened, and we become open to more of God. If we do not, we keep our old spirit, our hearts become hardened, and God becomes more distant to us over time. But you say: "How do sayings #1, #2, and #3 fit into this? What about #1 for example? What about trusting in Yeshua to be saved?" Consider the totality of what John 3:14-18 says: Just as Moshe lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up; so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone who trusts in him [some translations say "believes in Him"] may have eternal life, instead of being utterly destroyed. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but rather so that through him, the world might be saved. Those who trust in him are not judged; those who do not trust have been judged already, in that they have not trusted in the one who is God''s only and unique Son.
    For anyone to believe and trust in Yeshua we must be brought to that belief and trust by the Holy Spirit, i.e. by God Himself who draws us near through the Holy Spirit ( John 6:44 ). Man cannot perceive the invisible God by his natural senses so, without the Holy Spirit, there is no natural way to know Him, and therefore no reason to believe in Him since we (presumably) do not believe what the Bible says of Him either. So, the Holy Spirit is needed in order for statement #1 above to be true. And the Holy Spirit is likewise needed for statement #2 but, as valuable as receiving power and spiritual gifts are, they are not as primary as knowing God for Who He Is; that knowledge can only be brought to us by the Holy Spirit. As for statement #3, if we blaspheme and therefore reject the Holy Spirit, we cannot be brought to the place of knowing either God the son or God the Father, and we therefore cannot be saved. On the other hand, if we blaspheme the Father or Yeshua (sinful to be sure) but
    do not reject the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit can eventually lead us to repentance and salvation. That is why Scripture refers to blaspheming the Holy Spirit (and not the Father nor the Son) as an eternal sin. 1 Thus far, I have spoken of receiving Messiah and the Holy Spirit and of their respective ministries, but Scripture also speaks of an "immersion" or "baptism" ( Matthew 3:11 ), and a "filling" ( Ephesians 5:18 ) of the Holy Spirit as well. I believe that they are essentially the same, but perhaps the baptism is an initial filling. Apparently, the Holy Spirit is like a fluid, and we can have more of less of Him depending upon our willingness to receive Him, and our repentant condition. We can have a minimal amount of Him - just enough to bring us to the place of salvation, and we can also be filled with Him, the result being that He can give us spiritual power and spiritual gifts ( 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 ). Oppositely, we can lose a portion of the Holy Spirit (drip-by-drip) as
    a result of sin, and can be re-filled with the Holy Spirit if and when we repent ( Ephesians 5:18 ). This Mitzvah and its accompanying Scriptures clearly show that the triune persons of God work together, and that the Holy Spirit, along with Messiah, is key to our relationship with God and to our salvation. 1. I do not believe that Scripture teaches that a momentary blasphemous remark against the Holy Spirit leads to eternal unforgiveness. I believe that Stern translates Matthew 12:32 correctly in saying: " ... but whoever keeps on speaking against the Ruach HaKodesh will never be forgiven ... "'

  commandment: We are to put God first in our priorities.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: If we understand that the "gods" in Exodus 20:3 are not only false deities, but rather all persons, matters, and things to which we "bow down" (i.e. put ahead of God and allow to control our lives), we understand how it is the quintessential Scripture that supports this Mitzvah . After that, Matthew 6:33 calls us to faith by exhorting us to " ... seek first his Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. " It is telling us that, despite our perceived needs and natural inclination to dwell on them, if we put our attention on God instead of ourselves, He will see to it that our needs are met.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret Exodus 20:3 as referring only to false deities. This Mitzvah is not, therefore, addressed by any of the Jewish classical commentators in the broader sense of putting God ahead of all other persons, matters, and things.

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures that support this Mitzvah speak for themselves and, for the most part, require little embellishment. I will, however, comment on one of them that is often misunderstood. In 1 Thessalonians 5:17 (according to many translations) the Apostle Paul exhorts us to: Pray without ceasing. If looked at the Scripture wrongly, it seems impossible to do and still conduct the other affairs of life. Therefore, I believe that Paul is referring, not to formal prayer where we stop everything and speak with God, but rather to the continuous dialogue that believers are able to have with God as we walk with Him (and He with us) throughout the day.'

  commandment: We are to be patient and wait for God to act.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Waiting on God and having patience are obviously connected. As a matter of fact, according to Galatians 5:22 , patience is a fruit of the Spirit. So why is exercising patience to wait on God sufficiently problematic so as to warrant a mitzvah devoted to it? It is because natural man''s way is to be impatient and to seek immediate gratification, so that when natural man petitions God for something in prayer, he judges whether or not God has answered or will answer his prayer by whether or not he sees immediate results. This Mitzvah calls us to exercise faith for God''s timeframe which is not the same as ours; consider the following Scriptures: 2 Peter 3:8-9 : Moreover, dear friends, do not ignore this: with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day. The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some people think of slowness; on the contrary, he is patient with you; for it is not his purpose that anyone should be destroyed, but that
    everyone should turn from his sins. Ecclesiastes 3:1 : For everything there is a season, a right time for every intention under heaven . Acts 1:6-7 : When they [Yeshua and his disciples] were together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore self-rule to Isra''el?" He answered, "You don''t need to know the dates or the times; the Father has kept these under his own authority." Waiting on God builds our faith and our dependence on Him, which are good things. Proverbs 3:5-6 expresses it well: Trust in ADONAI with all your heart; do not rely on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him; then he will level your paths.'

  commandment: We are to pray in faith, and have faith for the things for which we pray.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: First, we should understand that "faith" and "trust" as it applies to God are identical, and merely a translator's choice of words. Some interpret Mark 11:23-24 as assuring us that if we strongly believe for anything, God has obligated Himself to make it happen. But that is not at all what the Scripture says or implies. The Scripture says " whoever does not doubt in his heart but trusts that what he says will happen ... " There is only one way for us to not doubt in our heart for something, and that is for God to have placed it there. Then, having recognized what God's will is, if we trust Him and speak it, it will happen. God is not calling us to what is often called "positive confession", because in "positive confession" the presumption is that we have the power to control God and cause Him to do what we want him to do. Do we want a new car? The proponents of positive confession would say that all we must do is believe strongly enough for it and we will have it. No!
    God is calling us to first discern His will, and then trust Him enough to speak it aloud. If we properly hear God's will and speak it in faith, we can be assured that it will come to pass.

  commandment: We are to acknowledge and never deny our belief in God and in Yeshua the Messiah.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The undeniable weight of Scripture is that we are to always acknowledge our belief in God and in Yeshua the Messiah, and never deny it. Denial can be by lying or through silence that is misleading. The most common reasons that men deny their faith in God or Messiah are fear or to gain some advantage. Temptations to deny our faith predate the Torah itself. Consider how Job was consistently urged to curse God, but he did not. That book was preserved for us in Scripture, that we might follow Job's example when hard times, danger, or even benefit befall us where logic and common expectation tells us that we will fare better and safer if we lie or mislead someone about our Messianic faith. The story of Job is one of success. Centuries later, the story of Peter is one of failure, as he denied that he knew Yeshua and that he was one of Yeshua's disciples - not once, but three times. The temptation to deny the Lord can be subtle, and can come in many forms. Usually it comes
    from someone we want to please or someone we do not want to anger. It can occur when a co-worker blasphemes the name of the Lord and we do not (at the very least) walk away. It can occur when our employer makes a rude remark about the Lord's chosen people and we do not correct him or admit that we are one of them. It can occur when we go along with a joke that mocks marriage, sex, or other things that the Lord gave us and cares about deeply. It can occur when we hold back from witnessing to our parents, or when, as Jews, we acquiesce to eating treyf in order to be social. It can occur when we mislead another about our belief in Yeshua in our attempt to pursue Jewish conversion or apply for aliyah to Israel. The Scriptures cannot be clearer, from the earliest in the Tanakh to the most recent in the B'rit Chadasha . The mitzvot to wear fringes (and by traditional understanding phylacteries) for all to see, to display m'zuzot on one's doorposts (again for all to see), and to cleave to God
    and love Him with all of our heart, being, and resources, are the antithesis of denying Him. Regarding Yeshua, the New Covenant Scriptures make it very clear that our responsibility is to preach the Good News of His Messiahship, and that there are dire consequences if we hide it or deny it.
  classical_commentators: In their respective mitzvot , Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret "clinging" or "cleaving" to God in Deuteronomy 10:20 and Deuteronomy 11:22 as "associating" with wise men. Although in his 12 th Article of Faith, Maimonides warns against not believing in Messiah's coming or denying Messhiah's greatness, he makes no reference to it in his Sefer HaMitzvot .

  commandment: We are to know God & who He Is.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Scripture commands us to know God, but we cannot know Him without knowing something about who He is. It is true of humans as well. We can know everything about a person and still not know him because knowing a person requires that there be a relationship; if there is none, then we do not really know him. Scripture exhorts us to know God by having an intimate and personal relationship with Him; for example: John 17:3 : And eternal life is this: to know you, the one true God, and him whom you sent, Yeshua the Messiah. 1 John 4:8 : Those who do not love do not know God; because God is love. Indeed, Scripture tells us that God is our heavenly father; but, do we relate to Him as a father? One test is whether we relate to Him as we do (or should do) our earthly father. We talk to our earthly father. Do we talk to God? We listen when our earthly father speaks. Do we hear God when He talks to us? Ideally, we love our earthly father (and mother) because they gave birth to us
    and first loved us. God gave birth to us through His creation and 1 John 4:19 says: We ourselves love now because he loved us first. Loving God is foundational to our having a personal relationship with Him, and we cannot love God without knowing Him, and cannot know Him without knowing who He is. How do we know who God (in fact any person) is? We have to spend time with a person to know who he or she is, and it is no less true of God. If this Mitzvah causes us to evaluate whether we spend enough time with God to know who God is, then it has done its job. It is important that we know how to spend time with a God whom we cannot see. First, we can converse with God. If we are a believer, we know that God hears us when we speak to Him, but what is sometimes more challenging is hearing Him when He speaks to us. For those of us that confess that we rarely hear God or do not hear God at all, I would say that the first step in our hearing Him is our believing that we can. Our ability to know
    God through conversing with Him is a foundational attribute and empowerment of the New Covenant; we read in Jeremiah 31:32-33(33-34) : "For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra''el after those days," says ADONAI: "I will put my Torah within them and write it on their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will any of them teach his fellow community member or his brother [to] ''Know ADONAI''; for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest; because I will forgive their wickednesses and remember their sins no more." God says that the New Covenant he will make with the Israelites will result in everyone who is party to it knowing Him as Lord and, to achieve it, He will put the Torah within each of us, and write it on each of our hearts. I have no doubt that the Israelites of old who heard Jeremiah speak his prophesy did not have a clear understanding of how God would bring it to pass, but we now know that He did it by sending the
    Holy Spirit to indwell those of us who receive him. For that reason, knowing God must involve the Holy Spirit for, without the Holy Spirit, we are out of communication with both Yeshua and the Father, and therefore out of communication with God. God has graciously provided us with help for our getting to know Him, and that help is the Bible that tell us about Him - ergo , the Scriptures quoted in this Mitzvah about knowing Him. We must keep in mind, however, that knowing God (which is the goal) is different from knowing about Him, but knowing about Him helps us to know Him. Here are two Scriptures that exhort us to have knowledge about Him: Ephesians 1:16-17 : I have not stopped giving thanks for you. In my prayers I keep asking the God of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, the glorious Father, to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you will have full knowledge of him. Colossians 1:9-10 :&nbosp Therefore, from the day we heard of it, we have not stopped praying for you, asking
    God to fill you with the knowledge of his will in all the wisdom and understanding which the Spirit gives; so that you may live lives worthy of the Lord and entirely pleasing to him, being fruitful in every good work and multiplying in the full knowledge of God. While these Scriptures exhort us to have knowledge of God, they do not themselves give us that knowledge. I therefore refer the reader of this Mitzvah to the above list of God''s many attributes. The list tells us who God is and, interestingly, most of the items on it tell us who we should be as well. We achieve those attributes by putting off our old selves, and modeling our new selves after Yeshua ( Ephesians 4:22-24 ).'
  classical_commentators: The mitzvot compiled by Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch command us to believe in God, to love Him, worship Him, fear Him, cleave to Him and relate to Him in other ways, but they do not address knowing Him.

  commandment: We are to know that God is echad.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Hebrew word for "our God" in Deuteronomy 6:4 is " Eloheynu ", which is the first person plural possessive of " Elohim " - a word which, despite its plurality, all Genesis 1:1 translators agree means "God". In addition, the English word "one" in Deuteronomy 6:4 is the Hebrew word " echad ", which is a composite (and not an absolute) unity. So, while our God is plural in His nature, He is one God and not many Gods combined into one. This is a great mystery for which we have no natural example to aid our understanding. Wherever it occurs in Scripture, the Hebrew word " Elohim " (along with its derivatives), although plural, is universally translated as "God", and the Hebrew word " echad ", a composite unity, is most often translated "one".
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch express this mitzvah as "knowing that God is a unity." They emphasize the singleness of the unity by adding that God has no partner or associate, and are in agreement that believing in the unity of God is a core belief of the Jewish faith. None of the commentators acknowledge or discuss the composite nature of " echad ", or the plural nature of " Elohim ".

  commandment: We are to love God with all of our heart, soul, strength, and mind.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is recited by Jews the world over several times a day in a portion of the Torah known as the " Sh''ma " ( Deuteronomy 6:4-9 ). It is so foundational to Jewish faith, that when Yeshua was asked in Matthew 22:36 , " Rabbi, which of the mitzvot in the Torah is the most important? " he replied by quoting Deuteronomy 6:5 : " ''You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength'' " (see also Mark 12:30 and Luke 10:27 ). Loving God is a covenant commitment to Him that is proven though our obedience ( John 14:21-24 ) and our willingness and sincere desire to put His agenda before our own ( Matthew 6:33, 16:24-25 ; Luke 9:23 ). That notwithstanding, love (including love of God) has an emotional component to it, a passion, that must be guided by that covenant commitment; the two go together. Also, perceiving God''s nature, character, majesty, and faithfulness, causes us to recognize His love of us, and stimulates
    our love of Him in return ( 1 John 4:19 ). Loving God is also connected to our loving one another in two prominent Scriptures. 1 John 4:20-21 makes it clear that, despite any claim we may make to the contrary, we cannot love God if we do not also love our brother. The other Scripture is a continuation of Yeshua''s statement that loving God is the most important commandment; in Matthew 22:39 he also said: " And a second is similar to it, ''You are to love your neighbor as yourself.'' " (See also, Mark 12:31 and Luke 10:27 ).'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides analogizes loving God with meditating upon and contemplating His mitzvot ; he says that by so doing, we get to know Him and receive joy. Also, because the words of the Sh'ma speak of teaching God's mitzvot , Maimonides associates the commandment to love God with our obligation to teach the people of the world that they must have faith in Him and serve Him. Meir agrees with Maimonides, and adds the component of having affection for God. He refers to Abraham's relationship with God as an example of there being "love" between them, and he quotes Genesis 12:5 as an example of Abraham's love through obedience, and Isaiah 41:8 as an example of God considering Abraham to be His friend (see reference to this in James 2:23 ). HaChinuch adds an interesting perspective by stating that a man cannot fully obey God's Commandments unless he loves Him. This is the reverse of (but not inconsistent with) the Scriptures cited above that infer that one way to love God is
    by obeying His Commandments. HaChinuch also cites God's relationship with Abraham, and that our love of God should cause us to encourage others to serve and worship Him as well.

  commandment: We are not to test God's promises and warnings.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'We are commanded by Deuteronomy 6:16 not to put God to the test. What this means is that we must believe God in that whatever He says He will do, and not intentionally act in such a way as to force His hand and provoke Him to prove it. The bottom line is that we must trust and not doubt God''s warnings and promises. In Matthew 4:5-7 , we read how Yeshua Himself demonstrated the principle by refusing to jump from the Temple in order to prove His identity by forcing His Father to save Him supernaturally. There are two instances in Scripture where God seems to be saying the opposite. One of them is in Judges 6:36-40 , where Gid''on asks God for supernatural signs of His Word. But Gid''on was not testing God; he believed God. On the contrary, he was doubting the accuracy with which he was hearing God, and was testing himself. The other instance is in Malachi 3:10 , in which God says, in part: " Bring the whole tenth into the storehouse, so that there will be food in my
    house, and put me to the test ... " This is not a contradiction of the Deuteronomy 6:16 commandment either, because here God is not asking doubters or unbelievers to put Him to test Him in order to prove His truthfulness. He is lovingly beseeching Israelite believers to follow His instructions so that they can have and enjoy His promised blessings.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides does not command against testing the promises and warnings contained in Scripture, but rather against those voiced by God's prophets. HaChinuch interprets Deuteronomy 6:16 somewhat differently by saying that we should not test true prophets excessively. Meir does not have a mitzvah on this subject at all.

  commandment: We are to reverently and lovingly fear God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: "Scripture tells us that God is our Heavenly Father, that we are His created\nchildren, and that He wants us to have a loving relationship with Him. At the\nsame time, we are not to approach Him with the same kind of comfortable\nfamiliarity as we would a peer, but with awesome respect, having full\nknowledge of His power. This is easier to understand for those of us who have (or had) godly and\nloving parents here on earth, because we have experienced, in the natural,\nwhat good fathers and mothers are like, and we are able to transfer our\nunderstanding to our relationship with God. It is more difficult (and even\ncounter-intuitive) for those of us who have not had good parental\nexperiences, so we must glean our understanding from the words of Scripture,\nand from what others tell us and teach us. The attributes of God disclosed in Scripture are many, and often seem\ncontradictory. God is compassionate, yet He executes judgment. God loves,\nyet He punishes. So when\
    \ we read in Deuteronomy 6:5 \" ... you are\nto love ADONAI your God with all your heart ... \", and then read in\nScriptures like Deuteronomy 6:13 \" ... You are to fear ADONAI your\nGod ... \", we may not know what to think. The problem is partially that our English language Bibles tend to use the\nword \"fear\" to translate different underlying Hebrew and Greek words used in\ndifferent kinds of situations. So, for example, the derivative of ( yarei ) that is\napplied to God in Deuteronomy 6:13 means \"reverend fear\" - the kind\nthat holds God in awe, deference, and honor. Yes, the word can also mean to\nbe afraid of God but, when it is used that way, it is meant as a warning to\nsinners who ought to be afraid. It is a different kind of fear that is referred to in 2 Timothy 1:7 ,\nwhich the NKJ version translates: For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and\nof a sound mind. Here, the Greek word for \"fear\" Î´ÎµÎ¹Î»á½·Î± ( deiliah ), which has a different\
    \ connotation than ( yarei ) in that it\nmeans a lack of courage, cowardice, or timidity. Other Greek words such as Ï\x86á½¹Î²oÏ\x82 ( phabas ) and Ï\x86oÎ²á½³Ï\x89 ( phabei-oh ) in 2 Corinthians 5:11 and 1 Peter 2:17 respectively, have connotations similar to ( yarei ). In addition to the lexical evidence that fearing God (for an obedient\nbeliever) should not mean being afraid of Him, we also have textual evidence\nfor the same premise. A Scripture that strongly implies this is Proverbs\n22:4 ; it informs us that \"fear of God\" (\"fear\" being derived from ) is a reward that results\nfrom our being humble. In other words, it is a good thing - not something\nto be dreaded. Another Scripture that implies something similar is Ephesians 5:21 that tells us to \" submit to one another in fear of\nthe Messiah \" (\"fear\" here is Ï\x86á½¹Î²oÏ\x82). There\nis no other place in the New\nCovenant Scriptures that suggests that we should be afraid of Messiah Yeshua\nand, in fact, everything we\
    \ read about Him suggests the opposite. Therefore\n\"fear of the Messiah\" (and therefore Ï\x86á½¹Î²oÏ\x82 in this context) could not mean being\nafraid and must, instead, be referring to a character virtue."
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides does not say that we are to fear God, but rather that we are to believe in the fear of God, and be expectant of his punishment at all times. He then launches into a discussion of blaspheming, and pronouncing the Name of God in vain as it is related to fearing Him. Meir states that we must fear God, and that the path to fear and love are the same. He also refers to "reverend fear" that requires that we not pronounce God''s Holy Name in vain or without purpose. HaChinuch also uses the term "reverend fear", and warns us to fear God''s punishment if we sin. Like Maimonides (and to a lesser extent Meir), HaChinuch spends a considerable proportion of his writing on our not blaspheming or speaking the Lord''s Name in vain. The connection that both he and Maimonides make to fearing God is that, doing either, results in our losing the kind of reverend fear of God that God requires. Maimonides and HaChinuch emphasize an expectation and fear of God''s punishment,
    whereas this Mitzvah emphasizes a reverend and loving fear of God, with the hope and expectation of our not sinning. Maimonides also speaks of not speaking God''s Name in vain. Although all three commentators state that we are not to speak God''s Name in vain, none of them make reference to the third of the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:7 3 . Also, even though it is a reality that if one sins, punishment is likely to follow, I do not believe it is the intended meaning of the Commandment to fear God. Perhaps the difference in my approach has to do with my belief that we are exclusively in and subject to the New Covenant. The New Covenant acknowledges the possibility that a believer in God and Messiah will sin, but it does not assume it. This is unambiguously taught in 1 John 2:1 : My children, I am writing you these things so that you won''t sin. But if anyone does sin, we have Yeshua the Messiah, the Tzaddik, who pleads our cause with the Father. 3. For a discussion of Exodus 20:7 , see
    Mitzvah # A6 of this compilation.'

  commandment: We are to treat God as holy by proclaiming Him holy, by being holy and by not profaning His Name.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah re-formulates two of the traditional taryag mitzvot into a mitzvah having three components. The traditional mitzvot direct us to (1) sanctify God''s Name, and (2) not profane God''s Name. The components of this re-formulated mitzvah direct us to (1) treat God as holy, (2) proclaim God''s holiness, and (3) not profane God''s Name. There is logic to linking them in this way. God proclaims His own holiness, and requires that we acknowledge it by being obedient to these three directives. God''s holiness encompasses His entire nature that includes His integrity, purity, trustworthiness, goodness, righteousness, justice, compassion, love, and all His other attributes. There are other ways (in addition to these three) of acknowledging God''s holiness, but the key to them all is holding God holy in our hearts and thoughts and reminding ourselves of it regularly. That is the purpose of the third benediction of the Amidah and of the Kedushah - prayers that are a
    part of most synagogue services. The third benediction of the Amidah states: 1 You are holy and Your Name is holy, and holy ones praise You every day, forever. Blessed are You, Hashem, the Holy God. And the Kedushah (quoting Isaiah 6:3 ) states: 2 We shall sanctify Your Name in this world, just as they sanctify It in heaven above, as it is written by Your prophet, "And one [angel] will call to another and say: ''Holy, holy, holy is Hashem, Master of Legions, the whole world is filled with His glory.'' And it ends with 3 From generation to generation we shall relate Your greatness and for infinite eternities we shall proclaim Your holiness. Your praise, our God, shall not leave our mouth forever and ever, for You O God, are a great and holy King. Blessed are You Hashem, the holy God. 1. Translation: The ArtScroll Siddur , Third Edition, (Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications, Ltd., Sept. 2006). 2. Ibid. 3. Ibid.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides', Meir's, and HaChinuch's positive mitzvot RP9, MP5, and C296, respectively, all draw, from Leviticus 22:32 , the commandment that we are to sanctify God (or God's Name). Their negative mitzvot RN63, MN155, and C295, respectively, draw from the same Scripture, the commandment that we are not to profane (or desecrate) God's Name. All three commentators say, of their positive mitzvot , that we are to proclaim God to the world and never deny Him - even at the risk of injury or death. We are also to refrain from committing sin (especially sins connected to idolatry), since sin dishonors God and, by inference, denies His holiness.

  commandment: We are to serve, worship, praise, & pray to God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Despite the numerous Scriptures in both the Tanakh and the Kitvey B''rit Chadasha that exemplify and exhort to worship, praise, and prayer, there is no explicit commandment in the Torah that requires any of them. The overall message of Scripture embracing them is unmistakable, however, so the early Rabbis and codifiers of the Law decided to list (in their mitzvah compilations) Scriptures that command giving service to God, and to treat "service" as encompassing prayer. I chose to do something similar in this Mitzvah by joining worship, praise, prayer, and service, and letting "worship" be the umbrella that encompasses the other three. Scripture (in particular Zechariah 4:6 , Romans 8:26-27 and Philippians 3:3 ) is clear that true worship and its components can only be entered into with the power and assistance of the Holy Spirit. If one understands worship as being a complete giving over of oneself to another, it is easy to see how praise, prayer, and service can be
    components of worship. It is not always the case, however; whether they are part of, and contribute to worship, depends upon the degree of "giving over", and their intensity. For example, merely complementing someone (praising him) does not constitute worship, and neither does asking an ordinary favor of someone (old English usage of praying), or serving someone as an employee. That notwithstanding, requesting something of a person while continuously praising him, showering him with unsolicited service, and pursuing him with an attitude of submission and adulation, may very constitute worship. In common modern usage, the word "prayer" is generally understood to mean petitioning God but, as I have indicated, in "old English" usage, it was a request made to anyone. For example, in Job 33:1 (rendered in the King James Version of the Bible) we read of God saying:: Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. God was certainly not "praying" to Job as we understand
    Job to have prayed to God. Serving another is similar, in that whether or not it constitutes worship depends upon the degree to which the service is rendered and the attitude that accomanies it. We read in 1 Peter 4:10 : As each one has received some spiritual gift, he should use it to serve others, like good managers of God''s many-sided grace. This exhortation to serve others is clearly not an invitation to worship them, whereas Yeshua''s answer to Satan in Luke 4:8 : The Tanakh says, ''Worship ADONAI your God and serve him only.'' illustrates how giving service to God does (and should) rise to the level of worship. Serving another with abandon (as a willing slave) is what constitutes worship, and it is only appropriate in our rendering service to God. An additional word concerning prayer: It has been taught, in certain circles, that Mark 11:24 (and similar Scriptures) can be used as a way of getting God to give us what we want, the theory being that, if we believe for something enough,
    God will give it to us. It is called "faith" by those who advance this view, but it is a mistake because true faith requires first hearing from God, and then believing and praying for what God wants - not for what we want - unless the two coincide. A Scripture that must be applied when interpreting Mark 11:24 is Jude 1:20 : But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith, and pray in union with the Ruach HaKodesh. Praying in union with the Holy Spirit is the key (see also, Hebrews 11:1 ).'
  classical_commentators: 'Whereas Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch express themselves somewhat differently, they essentially agree that prayer is linked to service. Because they cannot find anything in the Torah explicitly commanding prayer, they treat praying to God and rendering service to God as being essentially the same and only quote Scriptures that command service. The only reference to worship is found in the caption of Maimonides'' Commandment #RP5, as translated by Charles B. Chavel in his two volume work, "The Commandments." 1 Meir captions his Commandment #MP7 as "Praying Every Day to God," and HaChinuch captions his Commandment #C433 as "The Precept of Prayer to the Almighty." Despite Chavel''s caption, Maimonides does not discuss worshiping God at all, but rather exhorts us only to serving Him and to prayer. Of the three, Meir is the only one of the commentators that connects praising God to prayer and service. He states that the commandment requires a sequence in addressing
    God: (1) praising Him; (2) petitioning Him; and (3) both praising and thanking Him. He also says that, in praying to God, it is necessary to do so with "focused intention of the heart." This is known as praying with kavanah . HaChinuch begins his mitzvah #C433 by referring to the Scriptures commanding that we give service to God, and then quotes Maimonides: Now, R. Moses b. Maimon of blessed memory wrote: Although this mitzvah is one of the all-inclusive precepts - in other words, those which include the entire Torah , since the service of God includes all the mitzvot - it likewise contains a specific detail: namely, that God commanded us to pray to Him ... HaChinuch then proceeds to explain our responsibility to pray three times a day, corresponding to the times when sacrifices were conducted in the Temple. He uses the term "prayer services", which links prayer with service, and expresses that predominant Jewish understanding that "prayer services" are meant to give "service" to God.
    As in the case of the other commentators, HaChinuch does not refer to worship even once. All three of the commentators, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch, rely on Talmud Bavli Ta''anith 2a as their authority for linking prayer to the Scriptures commanding service to God. 1. Charles B. Chavel, The Commandments , vol. 1, (London: The Soncino Press, 1967).'

  commandment: We are to cling to God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Clinging to God means that we are to tenaciously grab hold of Him and not let go. We are to derive our strength from God, trust Him, and allow nothing to separate us from Him or entice us away from Him. This becomes most meaningful during times when we are tempted us to abandon God and follow the path of self or sin. James 4:7-8a teaches that, during such times, we must submit to God. Moreover, take a stand against the Adversary, and he will flee from you [us]. Come close to God, and he will come close to you [us]. We do this by remembering God''s Word in 2 Timothy 2:26 : that [we] may come to [our] senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will. Yeshua addresses this in Matthew 6:13a , in the prayer he recommends to His disciples: And do not lead us into hard testing, but keep us safe from the Evil One.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides states his mitzvah as our being commanded to cleave (or cling) to God, and he goes on to say that the cleaving or clinging to God is accomplished through associating with wise men. Meir's and HaChinuch's mitzvot do not even mention clinging to God in the way they are stated (although Deuteronomy 10:20 is quoted as the operative Scripture); instead, they command us to attach ourselves to Torah scholars and their disciples. They then say that if we do so, it is as though we are attaching ourselves to the Shechinah . It is ironic that all three commentators choose to redirect Scripture's clear message of clinging to God, to a different message - that of clinging to men. They derive this equivalence from Talmud .

  commandment: We are to have reverence for God's sanctuary.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah historically applies to having reverence for the Tabernacle of God and later for the Temple, for these were, according to Scripture, most holy. Today, we may apply this Mitzvah to any biblically authorized sanctuary in which God dwells or in which we worship Him. This includes edifices such as synagogues, churches and chapels, and may be extended to their furnishings and accoutrements that are set aside as holy objects used in worship. We must treat even the space of these sanctuaries with respect and not conduct ourselves in ways that demean their purpose. Some synagogue and church sanctuaries are temporary or convertible spaces that are used for other things besides worship. In such cases, the space ought to be ceremonially commissioned when it is about to be used as a sanctuary, and decommissioned, and its holy objects put away, when its use as a sanctuary is concluded. The 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 Scripture is interesting in that it applies to our personal
    bodies and also to our corporate body, the body of believers. Having reverence for these bodies is not very different from how we are to treat sanctuaries of brick and mortar, in that we are to care for them and not subject them to, or use them for, unholy purposes.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch treat their respective mitzvot as only applying to the historical sanctuary of the Temple, whereas Meir applies it in a more contemporary way. He refers to synagogues and places where Torah is studied as "little sanctuaries" and states that we must not do ordinary and frivolous things in them like sleep, and engage in laughter and idle conversation.

  commandment: We are to model God's Holiness by our appearance & by what we wear.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: A common feature of the Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah is that they speak against conduct that detracts from some aspect of God's holy order. By "holy order" I mean the natural order of things from the creation, before the "Fall", that reflects God's will and perfection. One would hope that the Scriptures cited are self-evident and that man would want to obey them. Sadly, however, there are many perversions rampant in today's society, and ungodly forces agitating to hold them out as acceptable. The Scriptures that teach against wearing two species of thread (animal wool and vegetable linen) or sowing two species of seeds are symbolic of not mating two species of animals. With modern manufactured clothing such as we wear, it is not possible to know what kinds of threads have been used to make our clothing, but modern clothing is not known to combine wool and linen. Today there is no universal standard of what constitutes a male or female garment. It is defined by
    the culture in which the garment is worn, and tends to change over time. For example, women in the western countries wear slacks, whereas in years gone by they did not because slacks were then thought to be for men only. The prohibitions against marking one's skin, cutting one's flesh, and trimming one's hair and beard in certain styles deserve special mention because tattooing, body piercing, and bizarre hair styles have become increasingly popular. The commandments prohibiting them were given at a time when each of them was a recognized heathen practice, and anyone who exhibited any one of them was, essentially, declaring himself to be an idolater. Castration also mars the body, but its affect is more profound and will be dealt with separately elsewhere. It is still the case that permanent markings, disfigurements, extreme hair styles, and cross-dressing are with us today. Idol worship in its classical sense is no longer the issue, but rebellion against godly norms is, as is illustrated
    by "Punk" and "Goth" appearances that emphasize darkness over light. In addition, tattooing, cutting, and gross piercing permanently disfigures the body that God gave us and, for that reason, should be understood to not be God's will despite any religious theme (e.g. a cross) that a tattoo or item of jewelry attached to piercings may have. A believer who receives one of these knowing beforehand that Scripture prohibits them commits sin; one who receives a tattoo innocently has not committed sin, but he or she should refrain from making it visibly obvious because of what it implies. Once a tattoo has been received it is permanent, and if the wearer repents in Yeshua, any sin that may have been committed concerning it is over and done with. In my opinion, there is no continuing responsibility to attempt to remove a tattoo surgically.
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat the Scriptures cited herein similarly and literally, and connect them to the practices of idol worshippers. Gashing and balding the head (tearing out hair) over the dead are illustrative of those practices. HaChinuch refers to God''s evaluation of the creation in Genesis 1:31 : " God saw everything that he had made, and indeed it was very good. " To attempt to alter what God made is therefore very bad, and is sin.'

  commandment: We are to preserve and not destroy things that belong to God and that are holy.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah brings together two Scriptures that, at first glance, have little in common. Deuteronomy 12:2-4 commands the Israelites to destroy all the places and objects used for idol-worship that they find among the heathen nations they are dispossessing; however, if in the process of doing so they come across places of worship and things belonging to HaShem - those they must not destroy. Eight chapters later, Deuteronomy 20:19-20 forbids the Israelites from destroying fruit trees while laying siege to a city. The connection between these seemingly unrelated Scriptures is the attribute of "holiness" as applied to the trees. God indeed wants places where idolatry is practiced and implements used there to be destroyed, but He does not want His holy places and things - things that belong to Him or that He provides as a blessing for men (like the fruit trees) to be destroyed in the process. Even when they have fallen into the hands of an enemy - holy things of God retain
    their holiness and must not be destroyed. Ephesians 4:29 illustrates this Mitzvah in a less tangible form: Let no harmful language come from your mouth, only good words that are helpful in meeting the need, words that will benefit those who hear them. Here the holy possession of God that we must not harm or destroy is our neighbor. The Scripture warns us that our words can be harmful to those who hear them, so we must speak only good and helpful words in order to not bring destruction to our neighbor who is God''s holy creation. Jewish halachah and tradition have long recognized the principle of preserving, and not destroying, things that belong to God and that are holy. An example is that we do not "trash" or tear up old Bibles, Torah scrolls or siddurim . Instead, there is a procedure whereby we ceremonially bury them in a way that is analogous to the way we bury a deceased person. 1 . I am also reminded of the way in which Leviticus 19:23-24 commands our holy respect for fruit-bearing
    trees. We do not eat their fruit during the first three years of their planting; the fourth year fruit is considered holy, and all of it must be used for praising God. It is only from the fifth year on that we may eat the fruit with an expectation of receiving its blessing year after year. Consider also, our "practical" respect for trees in Israel where we seek to plant them and not destroy them (e.g. Tu B''shvat ). By contrast, the Israel Defense Forces came under severe criticism for destroying olive trees in the process of clearing land for Israeli settlements. This Mitzvah is mandated for both Jews and K''rovei Yisrael , and is highly recommended for believing Gentiles as well. The particulars of how to accomplish it need prayer - especially in these modern times when text that includes God''s Name can be deleted from a computer or from cyberspace at the touch of a button. 1. In Orthodox Jewish practice the list is greater, and includes such things as tfilin'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat this Mitzvah as two distinct mitzvot as follows: Regarding Deuteronomy 12:3-4 : All three commentators generalize the circumstances alluded to in this Scripture to include anything that is overtly holy (including one of the seven Names of God) and anything that is generally useful. Meir would carry this even to the point of not melting down a piece of metal upon which has been written one of God''s Names. HaChinuch emphasizes that we must not erase any holy writing, or destroy a temple or altar established for the worship of God. Both he and Maimonides state that if Scripture is written down by an Israelite, it must not be erased or destroyed. If it is written by an heretical Israelite, it is not holy and must be destroyed (even if it contains God''s Name) because the heretic did not believe in the holiness of the Name when he wrote it. HaChinuch says that if it is written by a heathen, it should not be destroyed, but rather
    hidden and stored out of sight. Maimonides agrees with Meir and HaChinuch, that we must not break down houses where the Lord is worshiped. Regarding Deuteronomy 20:19 : All three commentators interpret this Scripture broadly to include destruction of all kinds. Maimonides and Meir first deal with the Scripture literally as prohibiting our destroying fruit trees in the process of setting siege to a town, and Maimonides adds: "in order to cause distress." 2 Meir goes on to say that we must not cut down any fruit tree destructively, nor break a useful object, nor tear a garment, nor ruin food, nor demolish a sound structure. HaChinuch states that we must not destroy fruit trees in order to cause damage or loss, nor should we needlessly set fires, tear clothing, or break vessels. He says that the reason for these restrictions is in order to fulfill the mitzvah of loving others (presumably he means our enemies), and to bring out the love that is inherent in godly people. We are to love that
    which is good and beneficial, be saddened when a valuable thing is broken or destroyed, and never destroy anything in anger. 2. See also, Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Hilchot Melachim VI, 10 .'

  commandment: We are to use our speech, minds, hearts and actions for that which is good and holy.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This "positive" Mitzvah on "directing our speech, thoughts and actions to that which is good and holy" is a companion to a "negative" Mitzvah that "we are not to wrong one another through our speech." While the compilations of rabbinical commentators list many of the positive and negative elements of this Mitzvah , the weight of Scripture (that we should use every aspect of our being for good) suggests that this Mitzvah be written to combine them. This Mitzvah quotes a goodly number of Scriptures that reference how we are to use (and not use) speech and actions, but I want to also address what might seem (at first) to be opposite, which is holding back on speech, or remaining silent. Proverbs 18:21 says that speech has power, but silence also has power, as we read in Isaiah 53:7 , a prophecy of Yeshua''s use of silence in the final hours of his life: He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
    sheep before its shearers is silent, So He opened not His mouth. Here are some other Scriptures that suggest times when there is wisdom and virtue in being slow to speak or in remaining silent: Exodus 14:14 (NIV): The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still. Psalm 37:7a : Be still before ADONAI; wait patiently till he comes. Proverbs 11:12 : He who belittles another lacks good sense, whereas a person of discernment stays silent. Proverbs 13:13 : He who guards his mouth preserves his life, but one who talks too much comes to ruin. Proverbs 17:28 : Even a fool, if he stays silent, is thought wise; he who keeps his mouth shut can pass for smart. James 1:19 : Therefore, my dear brothers, let every person be quick to listen but slow to speak, slow to get angry'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch list mitzvot that include the components of this one, such as their mitzvot to love God (RP3, MP3, C418), not murder (RN289, MN32, C34), and not to steal (RN244, MN34, C224).

  commandment: We are not to conduct sacrifices of any kind apart from the Holy Temple.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is based on ones that Maimonides and HaChinuch wrote, limiting sacrifices to within the Sanctuary court. Their reason for highlighting this limitation was that the Israelites were to be reminded to not sacrifice to (or in the manner of) foreign Gods. This instruction is especially relevant in precluding our conducting sacrifices today at a time when there is no Holy Temple, but it gives no hint of whether sacrifices might be resumed if (and at such time as) the Temple is rebuilt, nor what kind of sacrifices they might be if it is. Clearly, with the sacrifice of Yeshua having occurred, they cannot be sacrifices for sin. The few Scriptures included herein that prohibit the use of unauthorized altars for sacrifice are but a sampling of many others that are in the Bible.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch paraphrase closely the Scriptures upon which they rely, and Meir chose not to write a mitzvah on the subject.

  commandment: If we appoint a ruler over us, he is to be one whom God chooses - one who rules according to the Word of God, and does not prefer himself over his people.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'How can Romans 13:1-6 say: For there is no authority that is not from God, and the existing authorities have been placed where they are by God. And how can Hebrews 13:17 say without qualification: Obey your leaders and submit to them. Are there not evil rulers that would command us to do ungodly things and yet we must obey them? It is indeed a conundrum unless we consider that the leaders spoken of are those referred to in Deuteronomy 17:14-20 - leaders approved by God, and governing with knowledge of Torah , and with intent to do God''s will. These rulers may be of our secular governments or they may be the elders of our congregations but, if we do what we ought to do - choose rulers that are approved by God and accountable to Him, all will be well. This requires that we be involved in the appointing process of our leaders, in order to make sure that whether king, or president, or governor, or congregational elder - our rulers will be of the mind and character to
    govern in godly ways. Yes, things go awry in this fallen world and, when they do, we must take our instruction from God (through the Holy Spirit) and rely on Him to set things right. And until things are set right, if we are commanded against God''s Torah , must obey God and not man (see Acts 5:26-29 & Revelation 13:6-10 ).'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch refer to Deuteronomy 17:16-17 to support their mitzvot stating only that a king must not amass great personal wealth. The quintessential example of a king that did amass great wealth is King Solomon who, according to 2 Chronicles 9:13-29 , received twenty-two tons of gold each year in addition to other items of worth, and according to 1 Kings 11:3 , had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines who eventually turned his heart away from God. Meir wrote no mitzvah on the subject.

  commandment: We are not to castrate a male human being other than for medical necessity.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: Castration is removing or doing irreparable damage to a male's testicles. There is no specific commandment in Scripture prohibiting the castration of human beings or animals, but we surmise it with regard to men from the Scriptures cited that impute holiness-connected disabilities to castrated men and beasts. Castrated men were prohibited from entering the assembly of the Lord and could not serve as priests, and castrated animals could not be used for sacrifice in the Temple. So far as I am aware, men-slaves are no longer castrated to produce eunuchs for guarding harams or young boys castrated to preserve their soprano, mezzo-soprano or contralto voices. Nevertheless, our society does neuter male animals to change their behavior, their size, or their tenderness when used for food. For example, steer meat comes from a castrated bull, a capon "chicken" is a castrated rooster, and an ox is a steer that has been bred for work. Castrating animals or fowls does not appear
    to prohibit their being considered kosher for food. Castration of men is occasionally done for medical reasons (e.g. cancer), and our various societies have, on occasion, castrated especially sex offenders as part of a punitive process.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch state that Leviticus 22:24 (despite it not saying so) prohibits castrating a male of any species whatsoever. Also, Maimonides and HaChinuch (not Meir) reference Leviticus 2:11 and Leviticus 6:10(17) , neither of which seem to have relevance to the subject of castration.

  commandment: We are to forgo self interest when appropriate.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The plethora of Scriptures that exhort us to die to our self-interests are due to the inclination of fallen man to dwell on himself and to put his interests above those of others. Still, we cannot completely ignore aspects of our welfare or we cannot live. We have to eat, clothe and shelter ourselves, keep from things unhealthy, and petition God to meet our needs (yes, petitioning God is most certainly a choice that is in our self-interest). Several of the Scriptures cited above speak of "loving ourselves", so "dying to self-interest" cannot be an absolute, and we therefore need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to determine when and how much each is needed. We encounter problems when we step out of God's will by being legalistic in either extreme - (1) putting others before ourselves in inappropriate circumstances, or (2) putting ourselves before others in equally inappropriate circumstances. A ludicrous example of the first extreme (putting another's need before our own)
    would be our stopping to feed a homeless man in the midst of our being severely injured and in need of emergency treatment. An equally ludicrous example of the second extreme (putting our self before another), would be our passing by an injured person lying in the street because we are hungry and late for dinner. Although neither of these examples are realistic, they do point to our need for God to cleanse us of unholy self-interest that is common to fallen man, and also to our need for Holy Spirit imparted wisdom in balancing our personal needs against those of others in the various situations that we encounter.

  commandment: We are not to practice idolatry.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Most of the mitzvot promulgated in the Mosaic era appear to command against worshiping foreign gods of the supernatural kind - sometimes attributed to animals and natural objects (e.g. the Nile river god and the frog god of the Egyptians), and sometimes man-made objects (e.g. heathen carved statues and the golden calf). While not spoken of directly in the Mosaic Law, Satan and satanic influence is at the core of all idolatry and of all gods other than the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It was the archangel Lucifer (later named Satan) who first rebelled against God, and who was cast out of heaven and allowed to become the god of the earth to the extent that man would allow him. Satan''s first attempt at seducing man away from God was successful (i.e. Adam and Eve), and the rest of the earth''s history has been his war against God for the heart of mankind. There were (and still are) pagans who were/are susceptible to worshiping foreign gods, such as the Canaanites
    and Egyptians of old, and the Hindus and Satanists of today. The religions of the Canaanites and Egyptians severely impacted the Israelites in years gone by but, today, Satan''s attack on God''s people is more subtle. We get a hint of the kinds of idols that impact us most today from the following Scriptures: 1 Samuel 15:23: For rebellion is like the sin of sorcery, stubbornness like the crime of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of ADONAI, he too has rejected you as king. Ephesians 5:5: For of this you can be sure: every sexually immoral, impure or greedy person - that is, every idol-worshipper - has no share in the Kingdom of the Messiah and of God. Colossians 3:5: Therefore, put to death the earthly parts of your nature - sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed (which is a form of idolatry) 1 Timothy 6:10: For the love of money is a root of all the evils; because of this craving, some people have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves to the
    heart with many pains. These Scriptures indicate that stubbornness, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed for money and property are all idols. Other common idols are money, property, power, and security. An idol is therefore anything (or anyone) that we desire more strongly than we desire God, and idolatry is any giving-in to such a desire, such that we put that thing or person ahead of God. This Mitzvah commands us to put away all idolatry, both the worship of foreign gods, as well as those other idols that draw us away from the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Anyone who allows such things to dominate his or her life is guilty of idolatry.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote nine mitzvot that collectively express the principle of this one Mitzvah . Most of the commentators' mitzvot are self-explanatory, but there is one that bears special mention. In his mitzvah C27, HaChinuch criticizes Maimonides for making no distinction of culpability between making an idol with one's own hands, and commissioning one's agent to make an idol for him. HaChinuch writes that there should be such a distinction because of an established Talmudic rule ( TB Kidushin 42b ) that a person who commissions another to commit a wrong is not himself guilty of the wrong. In saying this, HaChinuch may be referring to Maimonides' RN3 and not RN2 which is described in this Mitzvah . Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch wrote separate mitzvot for bowing down to an idol (Maimonides RN5; Meir MN11; HaChinuch C28), and for worshiping an idol (Maimonides RN6; Meir MN 12; HaChinuch C29), which seems to me to be splitting hairs. In their
    mitzvot RN14, MN13, and C86 respectively, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret Exodus 23:13 narrowly to mean that we are not to swear in the name of idols, and in their mitzvot RN26, MN27, and C518 respectively, they interpret it to mean that we are not to prophesy in the name of an idol. In his mitzvah RN10, Maimonides admonishes the reader to not study or pay attention to idolatry, whereas Meir and HaChinuch (MN16 and C213 respectively) command the reader to not turn toward idolatry. While there is, indeed, the possibility that a spiritually weak person could become attracted to idolatry through learning about it, I do not believe that the Scriptures cited support such a broad restriction. Deuteronomy 12:30 is clear that the prohibition is against inquiring about foreign gods for the purpose of following them.

  commandment: We are not to pursue, engage in, or utilize anything that is occult.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah commands against seeking, engaging in, or utilizing occult supernatural powers. The term "occult" covers a wide range of prohibited activities that include (but are not limited to) divining, fortune-telling, sorcery, astrology, magic, wizardry, witchcraft, enchanting, soothsaying, spell-casting, or consulting the dead or communicating with spirits other than the Spirit of God. This Mitzvah is relevant today because many (if not all) of the occult practices mentioned in Scriptures are still practiced in certain quarters. Some more recent occult activities that are not mentioned in Scripture are hexing, water witching, numerology, Kabbalah , voodoo, new age spiritism, mindreading, channeling, energy healing (and there are others). It is not necessary to know the definitions of each of these or how each is different from the others. All that one needs to know is that it is a serious sin to attempt to communicate with any spirit other than the Holy Spirit,
    or to seek power from any source other than from God.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch each wrote ten mitzvot that collectively express the principle of this Mitzvah . Curiously and uncharacteristically, HaChinuch's mitzvah C514 (having to do with a kind of wizardry) that is analogous to Maimonides' mitzvah RN37 and Meir's mitzvah MN173, does not reference a Scripture from the Torah , but only tractate Kil'ayim (viii, 4) of the Jerusalem Talmud, and Job 5:23 (see * above) that seemingly speaks to an unrelated subject.

  commandment: We are not to derive any benefit from idolatry.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah prohibits us from deriving any benefit from idolatry. This includes deriving benefit from objects of idolatry, from idolatry as a practice, and from those who engage in it. We are prohibited from selling or even possessing objects of idolatrous worship, and thereby benefitting from their value and the intrinsic value of their material components. We are also prohibited from benefitting in less obvious ways such as (I would argue) employing idolaters to do for us on the Shabbat , that which we are commanded to not do ourselves. It also prohibits us from benefitting from idols that are not of the physical kind, but rather idols of the heart and flesh such as pride, lust, self before God (and others), etc. There are numerous ways that we might be able to (but must not) derive benefit from such idols; an example would be compromising a moral biblical precept in order to not lose a business opportunity (see Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 ). Idols of all kinds
    (including things of the occult) are associated with demons and curses (see Deuteronomy 7:26 ), and we must therefore not possess them, take them into our homes, or even touch them. It is a matter of discernment, however, as to how direct the receiving of benefit from an idol or idolatry must be, in order for it to be considered a violation of Scripture. For example, is it permissible to eat food prepared by one you suspect of being an idol worshiper? Suppose the restaurant one enters exhibits a statue of Buddha or displays food sacrificed to the proprietor's ancestors? Interestingly, Scripture allows Israelites to receive commercial benefit from foreigners (most likely idolaters during the time of Moses) that they cannot receive from fellow Jews. One such example is that all debts are cancelled during the sh'mittah (sabbatical year) as to fellow Jews but not as to foreigners ( Deuteronomy 15:1-3 ). Therefore, if you loan to a foreigner and the sh'mittah arrives, you can continue to
    collect what you have loaned, whereas, if you loan to a Jew you cannot. Another example is that, according to Deuteronomy 23:21(20) , a Jew can lend at interest to an outsider (presumably even an idolater), whereas a loan to a fellow Jew has to be interest-free. Finally, note the similarity of Acts 15:28-29 and Deuteronomy 32:38 in their instruction to not eat or drink foods connected to idol worship. They both prohibit the physical eating of such foods, but one might perceive a broader and higher meaning from them, which is to abstain from nourishing ourselves with anything related to idolatry.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat the subject of not benefiting from idolatry as several mitzvot . They anticipate that some of the prohibited benefits of idolatry could be (1) covenanting with idolaters for any gainful purpose; (2) wearing items that have adorned an idol; (3) obtaining a wife for one's son; and (4) profiting from the precious materials of carved statues.

  commandment: We are not to entice others to idolatry.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The Scriptures are clear that we are not to entice anyone into idolatry. Although they refer to physical idols and false gods, Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 consider anything to be a "god" or an idol that competes with the one true God by becoming man's master or that we put ahead of the one true God in any other way. Such idols can be money, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, property, power, security, greed, and others. Consequently, anyone who entices others to pursue such things is guilty of violating the Scriptures that underlie this Mitzvah .
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch published similar mitzvot on the subject of this Mitzvah . Maimonides' RN15, Meir's MN14, and HaChinuch's C87 declare that we must not call any person to idolatry, and Maimonides' RN16, Meir's MN23, and HaChinuch's C462 state that we must not persuade an Israelite to engage in idolatry. Maimonides supports the Scripture's prescribed death penalty for leading an Israelite into idolatry, and states that the victim - the one who was persuaded - should be the one to put the enticer to death. Capital punishment by the governing authorities is not authorized in the New Covenant but, where there is unrepentance, excommunication and expulsion from the community of believers is authorized (see Proverbs 22:10 , Matthew 18:15-17 , Romans 16:17 , 1 Corinthians 5:11 , 2 Thessalonians 3:6 , and Titus 3:10-11 ).

  commandment: We are not to enable others to idolatry.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 make it clear that Idolatry is broader than just worshiping physical idols and foreign gods. An idol is anything (or anyone) that we desire more strongly than we desire God, and idolatry is any giving-in to such a desire, and putting that thing or person ahead of God. Given that definition, what it means to practice idolatry or entice others to idolatry is clear but, what is not as clear is what it means to enable idolatry. That is more subtle and often goes unrecognized. We know that a family member is addicted to alcohol, yet we allow him to store liquor in the house. We have a listless son who will not work, yet we house him, feed him, and lend him our car. Consciously enabling another to commit sin (including idolatrous sin) makes us a participant, and as culpable as the one who actually commits it. The commandment in Deuteronomy 7:2 to kill the heathen and show no mercy was given in the context of Israel first entering the promised
    land and God delivering the heathen of the land into their hands for destruction. Even today, we should show limited mercy to the opponents of God if the mercy will further their idolatry. To give a trivial opinion example, if a person drops a stack of pamphlets that teach unbiblical practices, we should not assist him in gathering them up. We cannot apply the Scripture to justify destroying all heathens in these New Covenant times because that would be in violation of Leviticus 19:18 and Matthew 22:39 , which require that we love our neighbor, in violation of Matthew 5:44 , which commands us to love our enemies, and in violation of 1 Peter 2:13-14 , which commands us to submit to human authorities. To destroy all idolaters today would also be contrary to our New Covenant commission to carry God's Word to the sinners of the world ( Mark 16:15 ; Luke 15:10 ; Romans 5:8 ; 1 Timothy 1:15 ). Now a word about Exodus 23:33 that prohibits us from allowing idolaters to dwell in our land lest
    their sin be a snare for us. As individuals, we cannot control what is allowed in the Land of Israel, but we do have control over who we allow to live in our houses and congregations. This is not to say that we should not invite idolatrous sinners into our dwelling places as guests for a time, for how else can we minister the Word of God to them? Still, such persons should not be invited for an extended period of time, or allowed to share occupancy with us as co-owners or co-tenants.
  classical_commentators: 'This Mitzvah consolidates several mitzvot that were codified separately by Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch. In his mitzvah to show no mercy to idol-worshippers, Meir takes an exceptionally severe position by saying that if we see an idol-worshipper drowning, we are not to save him, and if we find him ill, we are not to cure him. He does not, however, advocate precipitating a person''s death merely because he is an idol-worshipper. Maimonides treats this mitzvah in another way - as a prohibition against extending grace to an idolater. He says, for example, that we must not complement an idolater as being good-looking. A strange example, but it makes the point. Note: Leviticus 19:16 that is cited by Maimonides'' RN19, and Exodus 23:5 that is cited in Maimonides'' RN18 and HaChinuch''s C458, do not appear to have relevance to the subject of this Mitzvah .'

  commandment: We are to cease all idolatrous practices, and destroy associated objects and places that are within our domain and control.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Mosaic Law calls for a complete destruction of idolatry including, in many cases, killing idolaters themselves. During the time of Moses, the Israelites lived under a theocracy that was governed directly by God that made these practices reasonable, but today we live under (and are subject to) governments that are secular. The laws under which we live today do not allow us to apply many of the Mosaic Laws literally, and they should not allow it, because the governments under which we now live are not ruled by God. That notwithstanding, God's extremely negative attitude toward idolatry should be adopted as our own, and we should seek the Holy Spirit for how to bring destruction to idolatry in every way that is permissible in our individual circumstances. Idolatry, in its broadest terms, comprises not only the worship of false deities, but anything that we allow to displace God in ruling our lives. Colossians 3:5 lists some of them and, although slaying idolatrous
    people is not authorized in the New Covenant, we are called to put to death instead, things such as sexual immorality, impurity, evil desires, and greed (see also, Matthew 6:24 ). Because today we live under secular laws and governments, we cannot do away with objects and places of idolatry that are owned by others. We cannot, for example, smash the statue of Buddha in our neighborhood Chinese restaurant, nor burn down the Hindu temple across town. We can, however, destroy and remove from our own houses and domains under our control, idolatry-connected art, jewelry, books, videos, and other such items that are owned by us, and we should. Similarly, we should not play games or view videos that depict idolatrous or occult practices, and should not show approval of those that do. As for the broader definition of idols, i.e. associations, things and practices that draw us toward unholy thoughts or deeds or that exercise power over us that is not from God - these we must renounce and do away
    with, and help others to do so as well.
  classical_commentators: 'The mitzvot of Maimonides and HaChinuch ascribe credibility to a literal contemporary interpretation of the Mosaic Scriptures, whereas Meir does not. For example, in his RN186 and RN187, Maimonides states 1 that we must "slay all the people of an apostate city", and "exterminate the seven Nations that inhabited the Land of Canaan." Meir simply does not write corresponding mitzvot for these two. 1. Maimonides, Sefer Ha-Mitzvot of Maimonides , v. 1, pp. 199-202 (London: The Soncino Press Ltd, 1967).'

  commandment: We are not to listen to those who would lead us toward idolatry.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The Scriptures are clear that we are not to listen to those who would lead us toward idolatry. Although they refer to physical idols and false gods, Matthew 6:24 and Colossians 3:5 consider anything to be a "god" or an idol that competes with the one true God by becoming man's master, or that we put ahead of the one true God. Such idols can be money, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, property, power, security, greed, and others. Consequently, anyone who listens to those who lead toward such things, violates this Mitzvah .
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah incorporates two of the classical commentators' mitzvot - to not listen to one who prophesies in the name of an idol, and to not make one's home in the land of Egypt where one can be influenced by Egypt's heresies and idolatrous customs.

  commandment: We are not to enter into covenants with idolaters and unbelievers.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The Scriptures are plain in commanding that we are not to enter into covenants with idolaters and unbelievers in God, Yeshua, or the Bible. The kinds of covenants prohibited are not trivial agreements, but rather the kind that yoke individuals in causes for which the covenanting parties' understanding of God, morality, and ethics is material. Likewise, the kinds of idolaters contemplated are not those with minor personal bondages, but rather those whose idolatries render them unbelievers or persons whose judgments are likely to adversely affect the covenants into which they enter. The result of a believer entering into covenant with such a person can be isastrous because a believer's basis for conduct is God's Law, whereas an unbeliever recognizes no such authority. The prohibition of this Mitzvah does not usually apply to contracts such as those to buy or sell a described item at a defined price, because the terms of such agreements are not vague and are usually not
    dependent on the moral and ethical values of the parties. On the other hand, partnerships of most kinds (especially marriage) by believers and unbelievers are prohibited because, in the course of continuously dealing with one another, partners must be biblically in accord in handling situations as they arise. In cases of unequal yoking, the covenanting parties hold different values and respond to different authorities for their conduct; the result is that, sooner or later, they will either dissolve their covenant and part ways, or the believing party will be persuaded by the unbelieving party to compromise his or her biblical principles. Many a marriage and business partnership has been shattered through unequal yoking.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch limit their mitzvot to the kinds of idolatries that are prevalent in the Tanakh - the kinds that involve unbelief in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the consequent worship of heathen gods and physical idols. The people groups they include are the seven nations of Canaan and the Ammonites, Moabites, and heretics in general. They do not address idolatries of the heart and flesh.

  commandment: We are not to adopt the customs and practices of heathens.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures quoted herein prohibit the ancient Israelites and later New Covenant believers from adopting the customs and practices of heathens. Typical of these practices are eating blood, fortune-telling, practicing divination, rounding one''s hair, cutting the edge of one''s beard, tattooing or cutting one''s flesh, wearing heathen-style of clothing, wearing garments of the opposite sex, worshiping idols, practicing debauchery, becoming drunk, and participating in wild parties and orgies. Of special interest are Deuteronomy 12:2-4 and Deuteronomy 12:29-31 that enumerate ways in which heathens served their gods, and forbid Israelites from serving the one true God in similar ways. These two Scriptures have been the source of much debate as to whether customs and practices that were once used in idolatrous ways but are no longer used in those ways can be redeemed. Can a church not have a steeple because ancient heathen temples most probably had pointed roofs? Can
    we not light candles on Shabbat because the ancient heathen used candles and torches as part of their idolatrous worship? My opinion is that some such things can be used and some cannot, and we need to consult the Holy Spirit to know which are which. 1 Other Scriptures that are related to this Mitzvah are those that prohibit wearing clothing made of wool and linen, and clothing of the opposite sex. I see them as related. Deuteronomy 22:9-11 prohibits our sowing two different kinds of seeds, plowing with two kinds of animals, and wear clothing made of two kinds of thread (wool and Linen). Leviticus 19:19 prohibits our mating two kinds of animals, sowing two kinds of grain, and wearing clothing made of two kinds of ( shatneiz ), which means "stuff". Deuteronomy 22:5 prohibits our wearing clothing of the opposite sex, which presumably means mixing two kinds of clothing - those of our own sex, and those of the opposite sex. The theme that is common to all of these is mixing things that do
    not naturally go together, and reminds one of 2 Corinthians 6:14 that states: Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers. For how can righteousness and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have with darkness? Mixing things that do not belong together was (and still is) a perverted heathen practice (for example, mixing temple worship with prostitution), and we are prohibited from adopting heathen practices as our own. 1. In view of this prohibition, one might consider the inappropriateness of Christians adopting heathen practices such as displaying images of deceased persons, erecting Christmas trees, and coloring Easter eggs.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch address each Scriptural prohibition separately; they do not connect them in a common theme. For example, Maimonides' RN30 deals with adopting the habits and customs of unbelievers generally, RN43 deals with shaving our temples, RN44 with shaving our beards, RN41 with receiving tattoos, etc. According to Meir, examples of heathen customs that we must not follow are distinctive heathen dress, growing locks of hair, shaving the sides of the head, and leaving a crest of hair in the middle of the head (Mohawk hair style). Curiously, Meir exempts from such restrictions, those who are close to government rulers and, for whatever reason, must emulate their appearance. Maimonides likewise prohibits our wearing heathen dress, emulating heathens in their appearance, and participating in their social gatherings.

  commandment: We are to apply the Mosaic Law in a manner that is consistent with New Covenant realities.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah was written to explain God''s expectation of us in the New Covenant, and how to apply His commandments today that were given under the Mosaic Covenant. Although many Mosaic commandments are impossible or imprudent to comply with literally today, 2 Timothy 3:16 assures us that all of them are valuable in some way: All Scripture is God-breathed and is valuable for teaching the truth, convicting of sin, correcting faults and training in right living The reason that some of the commandments given under Moses cannot be complied with today is that they were constructed for a covenant that has been replaced (or has almost been replaced) by a New Covenant that is very different: Jeremiah 31:30-31(31-32) "'' Here, the days are coming,'' says ADONAI, ''when I will make a new covenant with the house of Isra''el and with the house of Y''hudah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by their hand and brought them out of the
    land of Egypt; because they, for their part, violated my covenant, even though I, for my part, was a husband to them,'' says ADONAI. " Hebrews 8:13 By using the term, "new", he has made the first covenant "old"; and something being made old, something in the process of aging, is on its way to vanishing altogether. Today''s conditions are changed. We no longer have the Tabernacle or Temple, there is no longer a functioning Levitical priesthood or Levitical High Priest and, even if we rebuilt the Temple and reinstalled Levitical priests, most of the sacrifices required by the Mosaic Law would be unauthorized because Yeshua is now our sacrifice for sin and our High Priest: Hebrews 10:10-13 It is in connection with this will that we have been separated for God and made holy, once and for all, through the offering of Yeshua the Messiah''s body. Now every cohen stands every day doing his service, offering over and over the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this one, after
    he had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God, from then on to wait until his enemies be made a footstool for his feet. Hebrews 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great cohen gadol who has passed through to the highest heaven, Yeshua, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we acknowledge as true. Hebrews 7:17-27 For it is stated, "You are a cohen FOREVER, to be compared with Malki-Tzedek." Thus, on the one hand, the earlier rule is set aside because of its weakness and inefficacy (for the Torah did not bring anything to the goal); and, on the other hand, a hope of something better is introduced, through which we are drawing near to God. What is more, God swore an oath. For no oath was sworn in connection with those who become cohanim now; but Yeshua became a cohen by the oath which God swore when he said to him, "ADONAI has sworn and will not change his mind, ''You are a cohen forever.''" Also this shows how much better is the covenant of
    which Yeshua has become guarantor. Moreover, the present cohanim are many in number, because they are prevented by death from continuing in office. But because he lives forever, his position as cohen does not pass on to someone else; and consequently, he is totally able to deliver those who approach God through him; since he is alive forever and thus forever able to intercede on their behalf. This is the kind of cohen gadol that meets our need - holy, without evil, without stain, set apart from sinners and raised higher than the heavens; one who does not have the daily necessity, like the other cohanim g''dolim, of offering up sacrifices first for their own sins and only then for those of the people; because he offered one sacrifice, once and for all, by offering up himself. Attempting to apply statutory laws in a literal way when the result is improper or does not make sense is what is called "legalism", and it is warned against in Scripture: Romans 6:14-15 For sin will not have authority
    over you; because you are not under legalism but under grace. Therefore, what conclusion should we reach? "Let''s go on sinning, because we''re not under legalism but under grace"? Heaven forbid! Galatians 3:10-12 For everyone who depends on legalistic observance of Torah commands lives under a curse, since it is written, ''Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the Scroll of the Torah.'' Now it is evident that no one comes to be declared righteous by God through legalism, since ''The person who is righteous will attain life by trusting and being faithful.'' Furthermore, legalism is not based on trusting and being faithful, but on [a misuse of] the text that says, ''Anyone who does these things will attain life through them.'' So, the question remains: How do we apply the Scriptural commandments of the Torah that seem undoable today? The answer is different for every commandment and for every situation in which we find ourselves, and the New Covenant Scriptures
    tells us how; it is to consult and be led by the Holy Spirit: John 14:26 But the Counselor, the Ruach HaKodesh, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything; that is, he will remind you of everything I have said to you. Romans 7:6 But now we have been released from this aspect of the Torah, because we have died to that which had us in its clutches, so that we are serving in the new way provided by the Spirit and not in the old way of outwardly following the letter of the law. Romans 8:1-2 Therefore, there is no longer any condemnation awaiting those who are in union with the Messiah Yeshua. Why? Because the Torah of the Spirit, which produces this life in union with Messiah Yeshua, has set me free from the "Torah" of sin and death. Romans 8:14 All who are led by God''s Spirit are God''s sons. Notwithstanding the importance of being led by the Spirit, it is sometimes helpful to group literally undoable commandments by subject category and consider their significance
    and application collectively. What follows is a list of such subject categories along with suggested applications, and one or two Scripture examples for each: Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Require the Holy Tabernacle, Temple, or Place that God Chooses Scriptures that Assume an Operative Levitical Priesthood Scriptures that Call for Punishment Scriptures that Pertain to the Government of Ancient Israel Scriptures that Pertain to the Land of Ancient Israel Scriptures that Pertain to Specific Wars Scriptures that Pertain to Sacrificing Animals Scriptures that Pertain to Bloodless Offerings Scriptures that Pertain to Holy Places & Things Scriptures that Pertain to Consecrations, Dedications & Redemptions Scriptures that Pertain to Ritual Purity Scriptures that Pertain to Health & Sanitation Scriptures that Pertain to Slavery & Indenture Scriptures that Pertain to Sh''mitah & the Jubilee Scriptures that Pertain to Criminal Justice Scriptures that Pertain to Civil Justice Scriptures
    that Pertain to Mosaic Jurisprudence Scriptures that Pertain to Idols & Idolatry Scriptures that Pertain to Family Matters Scriptures that Require the Holy Tabernacle, Temple, or Other Place that God Chooses Exodus 25:8 They are to make me a sanctuary, so that I may live among them. Deuteronomy 12:21 If the place which ADONAI your God chooses to place his name is too far away from you; then you are to slaughter animals from your cattle or sheep, which ADONAI has given you; and eat on your own property, as much as you want. The Holy Tabernacle, the Temple, and other special places designated by God were not only places in which to conduct sacrifices, but also where the glory of God dwelt on earth, and where men (who were authorized) could encounter God intimately and powerfully. Chapters 40 to 48 of Ezekiel prophesy the detailed rebuilding of a Temple that is mysterious as to its identity, function, and when it is to happen (or has happened). Some scholars believe that the passage is
    a commandment for the Jewish people to rebuild God''s Temple. Most significant, however, is that the place where God chooses to place his name is a foreshadowing of the New Covenant''s visitation of the Holy Spirit who has come to live within all men that are willing to receive Him: 1 Corinthians 6:19a Or don''t you know that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who lives inside you, whom you received from God? Also, 1 Corinthians 3:16 shows that the corporate body of Messiah is also a Temple of the Spirit today: Don''t you know that you people are God''s temple and that God''s Spirit lives in you? This is anticipated by John 4:23-24 where worship in spirit and in truth transcends a particular temple location: But the time is coming - indeed, it''s here now - when the true worshippers will worship the Father spiritually and truly, for these are the kind of people the Father wants worshipping him. God is spirit; and worshippers must worship him spiritually and truly. Scripture
    Catagories Scriptures that Assume an Operative Levitical Priesthood Leviticus 8:1-4 ADONAI said to Moshe, ''Take Aharon and his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket of matzah; and assemble the entire community at the entrance to the tent of meeting.'' Moshe did as ADONAI ordered him, and the community was assembled at the entrance to the tent of meeting. The above Scripture speaks of the ordination of Aaron and his sons as Levitical priests, and Aaron as High Priest. A significant value of the Scriptures concerning Levitical priests, is that they teach us what the functions of a priest and priesthood should be and, although the Levitical priesthood is no longer operative, other priesthoods are. The people of Israel are said, in Scripture, to be a kingdom of priests ( Exodus 19:6 ). Also, 1 Peter 2:4-5 defines a priesthood of believers in Yeshua, and Hebrews 4:14-16 establishes Yeshua as the New Covenant''s High Priest.
    God has New Covenant priestly expectations of Israelites (today referred to as Jews) and of all believers in Yeshua - not to conduct sacrifices - but to prayerfully intercede for others, teach, counsel, and otherwise serve our fellow man. Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Call for Punishment Exodus 22:2b-3(3b-4) A thief must make restitution; so if he has nothing, he himself is to be sold to make good the loss from the theft. If what he stole is found alive in his possession, he is to pay double, no matter whether it is an ox, a donkey or a sheep. Exodus 31:13-15 Tell the people of Isra''el, ''You are to observe my Shabbats; for this is a sign between me and you through all your generations; so that you will know# that I am ADONAI, who sets you apart for me. Therefore you are to keep my Shabbat, because it is set apart for you. Everyone who treats it as ordinary must be put to death; for whoever does any work on it is to be cut off from his people. On six days work will get done;
    but the seventh day is Shabbat, for complete rest, set apart for ADONAI. Whoever does any work on the day of Shabbat must be put to death. Leviticus 24:19-20 If someone injures his neighbor, what he did is to be done to him - break for break, eye for eye, tooth for tooth - whatever injury he has caused the other person is to be rendered to him in return. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 If a man has a stubborn, rebellious son who will not obey what his father or mother says, and even after they discipline him he still refuses to pay attention to them; then his father and mother are to take hold of him and bring him out to the leaders of his town, at the gate of that place, and say to the leaders of his town, ''This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, he doesn''t pay attention to us, lives wildly, gets drunk.'' Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death; in this way you will put an end to such wickedness among you, and all Isra''el will hear about it and be afraid. Leviticus 24:19-20
    declares that "eye for eye, tooth for tooth" is the Mosaic standard of punishment for causing personal injury to another. Expanding the principle to other kinds of infractions, one is reminded of a quote from W.S. Gilbert''s The Mikado : "Let the punishment fit the crime." Sensible as these standards for punishment may seem, they are rarely employed by today''s secular governments that tend to not allow creative discretion to judges. The Scriptures requiring execution and other extreme punishments of those who violate certain biblical commandments are often shocking because, by today''s standards, many of the offenses that called for death and other severe punishments during the time of Moses are not even considered crimes today. We no longer stone our rebellious and drunkard sons, nor do we put to death those who violate the Sabbath and, should we attempt to do so, we would be in violation of the laws of the secular governments under which we live. During the time of Moses, the Israelites
    lived under a theocracy that was governed directly by God and today, we do not. Torah for us today, is ancient law that we read about in the Bible in order to understand its principles. For the Israelites under Moses, however, it was contemporary law that was spoken by God directly to them from Mount Sinai. For the Israelites to disobey that which God commanded them in so personal a way would have been a direct "slap in the face" of God, and worthy of the severe punishments that we read about. There are also offenses in the Torah for which punishments are not severe by today''s standards, but which, nevertheless, cannot be applied without transgressing today''s secular laws. For example, Exodus 22:2b-3(3b-4) directs that a thief must pay double restitution for what he has stolen, and he must be sold as a laborer (a slave) if he cannot afford to pay. On the surface, double restitution seems fair and doable, but it is not enforceable because the secular laws under which we live do not
    allow for it, and slave labor is, of course, a violation of the secular law. For us, the main value of the various punishments we read about in the Scriptures is that they give us an understanding of the seriousness with which God considers certain kinds of wrongful conduct. In today''s world, capital punishment of a rebellious son would not be allowed. Yet, God considers rebellion and stubbornness so serious a sin that we read in 1 Samuel 15:23 : For rebellion is like the sin of sorcery, stubbornness like the crime of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of ADONAI, he too has rejected you as king. It is also of interest to note that, except for captives in war, nothing in the Mosaic Law authorizes imprisonment as a punishment; yet, imprisonment is the principle form of punishment employed by secular governments today. Really, imprisonment as a punishment is a blunt instrument because it does not promote heart-felt repentance. For non-capital offenses, restoration through community
    service and paying back offended persons (and then some) is much more redemptive. What is more, being imprisoned with other offenders often brings greater criminality that is acted out upon the prisoner''s release - the opposite of that which is intended. Societies should take this into account in constructing their systems of law. Scripture Catagories Scriptures that Pertain to the Government of Ancient Israel Exodus 30:13-14 Everyone subject to the census is to pay as an offering to ADONAI half a shekel [one-fifth of an ounce of silver] - by the standard of the sanctuary shekel (a shekel equals twenty gerahs). Everyone over twenty years of age who is subject to the census is to give this offering to ADONAI Deuteronomy 1:17 You are not to show favoritism when judging, but give equal attention to the small and to the great. No matter how a person presents himself, don''t be afraid of him; because the decision is God''s. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me and I will hear it.
    The Scriptures quoted could be complied with if one were a citizen of Israel under Moses, but could not (and cannot) be complied with under other governments. Still, they have teaching value. For example, the Exodus Scripture teaches us that there is a government''s need to know how many residents occupy its country, and the Deuteronomy Scripture establishes standards for judging legal cases, except that today, cases that are removed from a lower court are sent to a higher court - not to Moses.'
  classical_commentators: The 613 mitzvot listed by Maimonides and HaChinuch include several that cannot be literally complied with today. Meir's compilation leaves out many of them, which is why his compilation lists fewer. None of the classical Jewish commentators recognize the existence of a New Covenant, and their interpretations of the Torah Scriptures reflect that view.
  commentary_juster: Romans 7 makes it clear that we are in the New Covenant Order and not the Mosaic when it refers to the widow and indicates that she is now freed from her covenant bond. That would not have been the case were we still under the Mosaic Covenant. We who are believers have died and been raised in the Messiah and, although we have been released from the Mosaic Covenant, we are, nevertheless, expected to apply its teaching in a manner that is applicable in the New Covenant. Contrary to the idea of secular society, the Bible enjoins all nations to acknowledge God and to embrace the principles of God's Law for the governing of the society. In classical Protestant thought first defined by John Calvin, this was called the second use of the Law. God's Law (both Mosaic and New Covenant) provides the framework for society's civil law, so followers of Yeshua should work toward bringing their civil society into conformity with its principles. The ideal of all nations acknowledging
    the Lordship of God and His Law is repeated throughout the Prophets and the Writings.

  commandment: We are to administer justice both in and out of our courts.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The following is Merriam-Webster''s definition of "Justice": 1a. The Maintenance of administration of what is just especially by the impartial adjustment of conflicting claims or the assignment of merited rewards or punishments. 1b. The administration of law; especially the establishment or determination of rights according to the rules of law or equity. 2a. The quality of being just, impartial, or fair. (1) The principle or ideal of just dealing or right action (2) Conformity to righteousness and law. 3. Conformity to truth, fact, or reason - correctness It is a helpful definition but not dispositive because it self-defines by using the word "just". "Justice" is hard to define. I think of it as fairness that is somehow connected to authority. It has the connotation of a person receiving that which is due him or that which he deserves. In reviewing the Scriptures with the purpose of listing those having to do with justice, it becomes apparent that one would have to
    list just about the entire Bible. The Scriptures listed in support of this Mitzvah are therefore only a representative sample of those that can be listed, and the Bible;s emphasis on justice is evidence of how important justice is to God. Justice (or the lack of it) exists in all of society, and can broadly be put into one of two categories. First, there is justice that is connected to a court of law or other governmental authority, where what is considered "just" is defined by a rule or statute. The other category is justice that is informal, and has to do with how individuals or groups of individuals treat each other in their daily encounters. There is also a term known as "social justice", that can involve either or both of the aforementioned categories. Exactly what "social justice" comprises is controversial, but it refers to the equality (or lack thereof) of individuals within society, regarding their opportunities, privileges, and the distribution of wealth. It is too great a
    subject to be dealt with in this Mitzvah . As with all of the Mosaic era commandments, many of those having to do with justice are no longer directly applicable in today''s world in which we live. Examples are the commandment establishing sanctuary cities and commandments prescribing punishments for infractions of law - capital punishment in particular. Whereas, capital punishment was the ultimate penalty under the Mosaic Law and still is today under many systems of secular law, it no longer exists under the New Covenant, for which the ultimate penalty is expulsion from the body of believers (see Matthew 18:17 ). We understand that today''s legal matters pertaining to persons and things outside of the body of believers are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the secular governments to which we are subject, but we consider the Mosaic Law still relevant in guiding us as to the principles of punishment, restitution, restoration, and God''s will in general. In order for a court to have the
    capacity to adjudicate a case, it must have three kinds of jurisdiction - personal, territorial, and subject-matter. This applies to ecclesiastical courts as well as to secular courts, except that the territorial jurisdictions of ecclesiastical courts are considered to be the entire world. Secular courts get their subject-matter jurisdiction from civil laws (e.g. statutes, ordinances, case law, etc.), whereas ecclesiastical courts usually get their subject-matter jurisdiction from the Bible. 1 Personal jurisdiction is acquired in various ways in each of the court systems. In the secular courts it is sometimes connected to the defendant''s domicile, sometimes to where damages sued for have occurred, and sometimes it is defined by statute. Personal jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical court is a debated matter. It should be over all believers - Jews (Messianic & non-Messianic) if it is a rabbinical court ( beit din ) and over all Messianic Jews and Gentile believers in Yeshua if it is a court
    convened by a Christian church or Messianic synagogue. Sometimes, personal jurisdiction is acquired by the defendant being a member of a congregation, denomination, network of congregations, or organization; plaintiffs are automatically subject to the jurisdiction of the court to which they apply for relief. 1. Sometimes also from extra-biblical writings such as the Talmud.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'' mitzvah RP175 and Chinuch''s C78 are worthy of special mention because of how Maimonides and HaChinuch translate Exodus 23:2 . Both of their mitzvot follow TB Hullin 112 2 in declaring that the majority should rule in a legal case when there is a dispute among judges. Not contrary but different, the Complete Jewish Bible (in basic agreement with Christian translations) states: Do not follow the crowd when it does what is wrong; and don''t allow the popular view to sway you into offering testimony for any cause if the effect will be to pervert justice. That notwithstanding, the following English translation of the Tanakh 3 supports Maimonides and HaChinuch by translating Exodus 23:2 : Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment. Clearly, this second translation is quite opposite in that its phrase "to decline after many to wrest judgment" supports Maimonides'' and HaChinuch''s
    mitzvot RP175 and C78 respectively, whereas the CJB translation does not. It is important to note that even when a mitzvah of Mosaic vintage appears to have application today, the application may have to be adjusted. An example would be the mitzvah to not convict a person on the testimony of only one witness. The caution is still observed, but today''s forensic technologies (e.g. ballistic and DNA testing, photographs, voice recordings, etc.) allow very great certainty in connecting suspects to crimes without their being even a single eyewitness. A word is needed regarding Maimonides'' departure from Meir and HaChinuch concerning the meaning of Deuteronomy 17:11 . Meir and HaChinuch interpret " the place which ADONAI your God will choose " as the Sanhedrin . Maimonides, on the other hand, in his RN312, interprets the Scripture to mean that we are not to disagree with the authorized conveyors of tradition. 2. This reference is to tractate Hullin of the Babylonian Talmud. 3. "The Holy

  commandment: We are not to injure or cause damages but, should we do so, we must make restitution and pay penalties prescribed by law.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: '"Damages" is that aspect of law that has to do with loss. If damage is to a person, we call it "injury". Damages that are actionable (recoverable from another) originate in either "tort" or "contract". A tort is a wrongful act (intentional or unintentional) that infringes the rights of another and leads to damages. An example of an intentional tort is assault, and of an unintentional tort is negligence that causes damages. A contract is an agreement between parties, and damages can result from a party either intentionally or unintentionally failing to fulfill his or her part of the agreement. An intentional bailment is usually a contract to place one''s property in the custody and care of another. A bailment can, however, come about unintentionally, such as when one finds and takes temporary possession lost property. Depending on the circumstance of what causes damage or injury, appropriate remedies can be restitution, paying compensatory money damages, paying punitive
    damages (in the case of an intentional or reckless tort or gross negligence), specific performance of a contract (a court order to perform a contract as agreed), etc. What we are speaking of here are infractions of civil law as distinguished from criminal law, but they sometimes overlap. An example of overlap is theft. Theft is a civil offense to the victim who incurs financial damage, and it is simultaneously a criminal offense to society at large because of damage to the peace of the community. Bringing a thief to justice can, therefore, involve making restitution to the person from whom he stole, paying a fine to society, and also possibly a jail sentence. The Scriptures listed above each speak to circumstances and conduct that can and often do cause damages. The torts, contracts, and remedies illustrated by the Scriptures are mere examples of others that exist, but they serve to make the point. Some of them are geared more to the time of Moses than to today, but similarities to modern
    situations can easily be seen, which is why our contemporary laws have largely been derived from these ancient examples. In today''s urban society I do not have an ox to be gored by my neighbor''s ox, but I do have a car that could conceivably be gored by his car; it is the same principle. In order for a civil court to have the capacity to adjudicate a claim for damages, it must have three kinds of jurisdiction - personal, territorial, and subject matter. An ecclesiastical court (a Jewish court is called a bet din ) must have these as well, except that its territorial jurisdiction is considered the entire world. Civil courts get their subject matter jurisdiction from civil law (e.g. statutes, ordinances, case law, etc.) and ecclesiastical courts get their subject matter jurisdiction from the Bible. Personal jurisdiction is acquired in various ways. In the civil courts it is sometimes acquired by the defendant''s domicile, sometimes to where the damages sued for occurred, and sometimes
    it is defined by statute. Personal jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical court is a debated matter. It should be over all believers in Yeshua if it is a church court, and over Jews (Messianic or not Messianic) if it is a bet din . Sometimes, personal jurisdiction is acquired by the defendant being a member of a congregation, denomination, network of congregations, or organization. Plaintiffs are automatically subject to the jurisdiction of whatever court they apply to for relief.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch limit their respective mitzvot to the specific torts and contracts referred to in the Torah ; they do not discuss modern applications or adaptations.

  commandment: We are to receive inheritance according to established law and to that which is approved by God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: There are three kinds of inheritance referred to in Scripture; they are (1) financial inheritance (money, personal property and land), (2) royal inheritance (e.g. kingship passing from father to son), and (3) moral inheritance (i.e. non-tangible assets such as character traits and ethical values. In addition, there are two mechanisms that govern inheritance - (1) last wills and testaments, and (2) statutes of intestacy (i.e. rules that govern inheritance in the absence of a last will and testament). All of these date back to the time of Moses and before but, because today we live under secular governments (not the theocracy of ancient Israel), today's laws of inheritance are what govern. Financial inheritance under Moses and today are the same in that they were and are controlled by statute, albeit statutes that are different. The system of financial inheritance under and prior to Moses was what we call "primogeniture". It is where all the financial assets of a deceased
    person are inherited by the person's firstborn or eldest son (sometimes firstborn daughters inherited as well), who then become the family's patriarch and is expected to use his inheritance to care for his siblings and their families. Primogeniture still exists in places, but has been largely eliminated in the western world where it has been replaced by laws of intestacy and "last wills and testaments." Wills that are duly made and executed govern (within limits) and, in the absence of a will, a person's financial assets usually go to his spouse and children according to a statutorily defined plan. Royal inheritance, where it exists in kingdoms today, is similar to how it was at times in the past, in that it normally goes to the firstborn child (sometimes the firstborn son) by law. In that way it is similar to primogeniture in that the firstborn has responsibility to provide for his siblings as kings have responsibility to provide for their subjects. King David was succeeded by his son
    Solomon in what is sometimes referred to as the Davidic Dynasty, and the kingship passed from father to son) until the Babylonian exile in 586 BCE. Moral inheritance is different from the other two in that through it, moral, ethical, and religious values are conveyed through God's influence rather than through law, but the result of conveyance is just as real. Within the Jewish community (and some other communities) there exists what is sometimes referred to as a zava'ah or "ethical will", which is a document designed to pass wisdom and ethical and moral values from one generation to the next. The idea of the ethical will is inspired by Genesis 49:1-33 , where Jacob prophesies over, and seeks to convey blessings to, his gathered sons.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch, wrote only one mitzvah each on inheritance. They were on financial inheritance, supported by Numbers 27:8-9 and Deuteronomy 21:17 .

  commandment: We are to appoint elders in our communities to lead, pray, judge, teach, & make halachah.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah presents Scriptures supporting the statement: "We are to appoint elders in our communities to lead, pray, judge, teach, & make halachah ." The Scriptures on appointing, leading, praying, and teaching are self-explanatory, so this commentary is limited to discussing the role of elders making halachah . Halachot are rules that have the force of law in a Jewish community. Elders of a Messianic Jewish congregational (or network of congregations) community can declare halachah (law) for their congregation or network if their community acknowledges that they have been given the authority to do so by Scripture. Examples of common halachic rules for congregations are (a) membership in the congregation requires tithing; (b) membership in the congregation requires attendance at services; (c) pork products are not allowed to be served at congregational meals; and (d) men that assist in a Shabbat Torah service must wear a tallit gadol . During the Mosaic era, elders
    were appointed to sit at the gates of the Israelites'' cities and judge cases that were brought to them (e.g. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 ; Ruth 4:1-2 ). With one exception, the cases decided by elders that we read about in the Bible are those in which a person lodges a complaint against another person. The exception, the one in which halachah is made, is Acts 15:1-31 . In that Scripture, elders and apostles gathered in Jerusalem to consider and rule upon how much of Torah (Mosaic Law) is required of the Gentiles. It is an inescapable necessity that elders of a community interpret God''s Law (both Mosaic and New Covenant) for their respective communities, and make decisions as to the Law''s application. If they do not, the practices of individuals and families within each community will be out of step with one another, confusion will result, and the community will not be able to function. Here is a Scripture from the Mosaic era that will illustrate my point; it is the familiar commandment to
    keep the Shabbat: Exodus 20:8-10 : Remember the day, Shabbat, to set it apart for God. You have six days to labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Shabbat for ADONAI your God. On it, you are not to do any kind of work - not you, your son or your daughter, not your male or female slave, not your livestock, and not the foreigner staying with you inside the gates to your property. But, what constitutes work? Continuing in one''s income-producing occupation is obviously the kind of work that is prohibited by the Scripture, but what about an elderly or disabled person walking three miles to a synagogue? That is obviously hard work for them, so is it allowed? If the elders of the synagogue community determine that it is, or is not, and make their ruling a standard for that community, they are making halachah , and such decisions are absolutely necessary for a community of individuals to be able to function together. There are hundreds if not thousands of such examples, but I
    will present just one more for clarity; referring to the Feast of Unleavened bread, we read: Exodus 12:15 For seven days you are to eat matzah - on the first day remove the leaven from your houses. For whoever eats hametz [leavened bread] from the first to the seventh day is to be cut off from Isra''el. But what does it mean to eat matzah for seven days? Does it mean to eat it every day for seven days, or does it only mean to not eat leavened bread for seven days? And what constitutes chametz ? Clearly, bread risen with yeast is chametz , but is it also other foods that have yeast in them? And if we let a piece of matzah be exposed to the air long enough for yeast spores from the air to fall on it, does the matzah become chametz and therefore unacceptable to be eaten during Pesach and the week following? These are the kinds of decisions that are best made by the Jewish community in which we live, and when the elders of our community declare the answers to these and similar questions,
    they are making halachah for their community. The concept of halachah is not the same in the Messianic Jewish community as in the wider Jewish community. In the wider Jewish community, halachah is inextricably connected to certain ancient rabbis whose rulings on Mosaic Law (both written and oral) are recorded in the Talmud . Responsa are modern (and not-so-modern) era decisions and rulings made by respected Jewish scholars in response to questions of Jewish law put to them - also involving the written and (what they consider) oral Mosaic law. Messianic Jewish halachah , however, is fundamentally different in that it does not acknowledge an oral Torah , and looks to the Scriptures (Old and New Testaments) as the only divine authority. It does, from time to time, consider teachings in the Talmud - not for their authority, but for information about what is considered to be Jewish in the wider Jewish community, and occasionally for interpretive wisdom and cultural application. There is another
    way in which Messianic and "wider-Jewish-world" halachah are different, and that is that Messianic Judaism seeks God''s interpretation of His Law, whereas Orthodox Judaism believes that it has the authority to interpret it themselves and even change God''s Torah ; the origin of this belief can be found in TB Bava Metziah 59b , in which one translation states: 1 It has been taught: On that day R. Eliezer brought forward every imaginable argument, but they did not accept them. Said he to them: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let this carob-tree prove it!'' Thereupon the carob-tree was torn a hundred cubits out of its place - others affirm, four hundred cubits. ''No proof can be brought from a carob-tree,'' they retorted. Again he said to them: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let the stream of water prove it!'' Whereupon the stream of water flowed backwards - ''No proof can be brought from a stream of water,'' they rejoined. Again he urged: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let the
    walls of the schoolhouse prove it,'' whereupon the walls inclined to fall. But R. Joshua rebuked them, saying: ''When scholars are engaged in a halachic dispute, what have ye to interfere?'' Hence they did not fall, in honor of R. Joshua, nor did they resume the upright, in honor of R. Eliezer; and they are still standing thus inclined. Again he said to them: ''If the halachah agrees with me, let it be proved from Heaven!'' Whereupon a Heavenly Voice cried out: ''Why do ye dispute with R. Eliezer, seeing that in all matters the halachah agrees with him!'' But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: ''It is not in heaven.'' What did he mean by this? - Said R. Jeremiah: That the Torah had already been given at Mount Sinai; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice, because Thou hast long since written in the Torah at Mount Sinai, After the majority must one incline. The Mitzvot presented in this book are my and Dr. Juster''s offered suggestions for Messianic Jewish (New Covenant) halachah , but can
    only become halachah if and when they are received as such by a Messianic Jewish community. 1. Online Soncino Babylonian Talmud Translation, Rabbi Dr. I. Epstein, editor, 2015.'

  commandment: We are to examine creatures for signs of their eatability, and are not to eat those that are forbidden to us.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'In the foregoing Scriptures, we encounter categories of creatures (and also specifically named creatures), some of which are clean and may be eaten, and others of which are unclean and may not. Eatability and cleanness generally coincide, but they are separate attributes as Leviticus 11:46-47 explains: Such, then, is the law concerning animals, flying creatures, all living creatures that move about in the water, and all creatures that swarm on the ground. Its purpose is to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten. The Mosaic commandments specifying which creatures may and may not be eaten are generally complied with as an unchallenged part of Messianic Jewish life and practice. Nevertheless, the question sometimes arises as to God''s rationale for these restrictions and whether today, in the absence of the Holy Temple (ceremonial cleanness had to be maintained in the Temple), the food
    restrictions still apply. Those who believe they still apply may offer their personal opinions as to why, but Leviticus 20:24b-26 gives us God''s reason: I am ADONAI your God, who has set you apart from other peoples. Therefore you are to distinguish between clean and unclean animals and between clean and unclean birds; do not make yourselves detestable with an animal, bird or reptile that I have set apart for you to regard as unclean. Rather, you people are to be holy for me; because I, ADONAI, am holy; and I have set you apart from the other peoples, so that you can belong to me. Scripture''s reason for the food laws is clearly that Israelites (today called Jews) are a holy people set apart, and are therefore commanded to a unique lifestyle (including restrictions as to what we are allowed to eat) so that we will be seen as set apart. This reason is not Temple-dependent, and is therefore as valid today as it was at the time the food commandments were given to Moses. Perhaps it is even
    more important today, because so many of the world''s Jews are integrated into the general society and have lost visibility. It is my opinion, therefore, that it is God''s will that today''s Jews (and the K''rovei Yisrael who dwell in community alongside us) continue to obey the biblically commanded restrictions on what may and may not be eaten, and that it is sin for us not to do so. There are those who would say that my position is not correct - that Jewish believers in Yeshua who aspire to keep the food laws (in fact any laws) are rejecting Messiah''s sacrifice and God''s grace, and are putting themselves in an unholy bondage. This false theology is discussed in general terms in my essay " Elephants in the Room: What Paul Really Meant by His Comments on the Law " that is found in the preliminary section of this book. It is beyond the scope of this Mitzvah to discuss the various New Covenant Scriptures that are typically used to come against obeying God''s food laws in the Torah, but
    I will mention the main ones for the reader''s convenience; they are Mark 7:18-19 ; Acts 10:9-15 and 11:1-9 ; 1 Corinthians 8:8 and 10:25-27 ; Colossians 2:16 ; and 1 Timothy 4:1-5 . How then should today''s Gentile believers respond to the dietary commandments? Some say that they should not seek to keep them because doing so will diminish Israel''s visible uniqueness as a people set apart ( Leviticus 20:24b-26 ). Others say: "If God gave these dietary restrictions to his ''chosen people'' they must be good, so I will adopt them as well." My opinion is that if Gentile believers voluntarily adhere to the biblical food laws as a witness to their grafted-in connection to the Jewish people, they are acting appropriately. On the other hand, if they profess that the commandments are directed to all believers in Yeshua in order to mark them as a holy people analogous to the Jews ( Ephesians 2:11-22 ) and that they are in sin if they do not keep them, then they would be wrong (in my opinion),
    and would indeed be obscuring Israel''s intended uniqueness. It is therefore my opinion that, in general, obedience to the food laws (other than those mentioned in Acts 15:19-20 and Acts 21:25 ) by Gentiles is optional. In closing, I should like to say a few words about the term " kosher " as it applies to the dietary laws - a term that I have thus far intentionally not used in this discourse. The word means "allowed", and it is correctly used in describing whether the Bible permits a creature to be eaten by an Israelite (e.g., "A goat is a kosher animal, whereas a pig is not."). The reason I have avoided its use in this Mitzvah , is that the word " kosher " has another connotation as well, and that is in stating whether the flesh of a particular creature (or a particular substance) is allowed to be eaten according to rabbinical standards. So, for example, the meat of a goat (which is a kosher animal) is not kosher , according to rabbinical standards, if the goat was not slaughtered
    appropriately, or that the slaughter was not conducted under rabbinical supervision. One ought to therefore be alert to how the word " kosher " is used in context, so as to elicit its intended meaning.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch are unified in their mitzvot that prohibit the eating of certain creatures but, whereas Maimonides and HaChinuch have written positive mitzvot requiring that we examine creatures for signs of their cleanness and consequent eatability, Meir has no such corresponding mitzvah . In their mitzvot #RP152 and C155 respectively, Maimonides and HaChinuch combine Leviticus 11:9-12 and Leviticus 20:25 to defend their positive mitzvot that we are to examine creatures of the sea for tokens (fins and scales) of their acceptability for food. Leviticus 11:9-12 describes the sea creatures that we may and may not eat, but Leviticus 20:25 makes no reference to fish whatever.'
  commentary_juster: 'For those not satisfied that the only rationale for this Mitzvah is that it is a standard created by God to make a distinction between Israel and the nations, they may consider these others: First is that it is for health. This is argued in " None of These Diseases " by S. I. Macmillan. The problem with his position is that not all the creatures prohibited in Scripture are clearly unhealthy to eat. Certainly, God''s best for Israel is that it be healthy. Second, is the idea that the clean-unclean laws (beyond the food laws) show the nature of sin in a symbolic way in that certain animals feed off death or, like pigs, are unclean because they are filthy (Keil and Delitzsch, " Commentary on the Old Testament ", first published in 1866). Third, is " Purity and Danger " by Mary Douglas, in which she argues that there was a reasoned sense of the ancients as to what was fitting or not fitting - what was whole or not whole - in categories of living creatures. It was seen as
    natural that fish should have fins and scales. In her last years before her death, she was no longer convinced of her position, and came to believe, instead, that there simply were animals that God valued as being free from men''s use. While there is truth in all of these views, it would seem best that we embrace the idea that God''s reason for making distinctions is part of his making the Jewish people distinct, and that not all of the creatures named in Scripture are subject to a human rationale.'

  commandment: We are not to boil a young animal in its mother's milk, nor do anything of similar cruelty to any of God's creatures.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The commandment " You are not to boil a young animal in its mother''s milk. " forms the basis for a number of halachic rules that include not mixing milk with meat, not eating foods that contain both milk and meat, and abstaining from eating milk and meat at the same meal or within some hours of each other. This illustrates the rabbinical principle of "building a fence around the Law" in which rules are promulgated that are more stringent than those of the Torah , ostensibly to keep one from violating the commandment itself. The problem with this particular fence is (1) no one accidently cooks a young animal in its own mother''s milk, and (2) keeping the rules of kashrut regarding milk and meat have so overtaken the attention of Orthodox Judaism, that the underlying moral message in the Scripture has been all but lost. What is that moral message? It most probably is "Don''t do cruel things to God''s creatures as the heathen do." I say "most probably" because we have
    no absolute proof that boiling young animals in their mother''s milk was a heathen practice. Nevertheless, it was certainly not a Jewish practice, so whose practice would it otherwise be? We know that heathens sacrificed children to their gods by fire ( Leviticus 18:21 ), and how very similar it is to kill a mother''s child (albeit an animal mother) by boiling it in her own milk - milk of her body that was meant to nurture it, not kill it. It is as though the mother herself had killed her child! I believe the commandment "You are not to boil a young animal in its mother''s milk" is an idiom that was very well understood in Moses'' day as meaning: "Don''t do cruel things to God''s creatures as the heathen do." The reason I believe it is an idiom meant to be interpreted broadly, is because it appears three times in Scripture, and all three times it is appended (almost as an afterthought that doesn''t quite fit) to commandments associated with our treatment of animals. In Exodus 23:17-19
    and Exodus 34:23-26 , the commandment follows instructions involving blood sacrifices, and in Deuteronomy 14:21 , it follows an extensive exposition regarding our use of living creatures for food. It is also meaningful that Abraham saw no problem in serving his guests a meal prepared with milk and meat ( Genesis 18:7-8 ), and his guests, who were (at the very least) God''s emissaries, ate it. What does this mean for Messianic Jewish practice? First, and quite obviously, we must not boil a young animal in its mother''s milk. Second and most important though, we must treat all of God''s creatures with humane kindness - especially those that we domestically raise for slaughter; this Mitzvah stands for that above all. Whether or to what degree we comply with Orthodox halachah regarding the mixing of milk and meat is entirely a matter of choice and not of commandment, but there are some situations where compliance is appropriate and even needed. One that comes to mind is where we live within,
    or are part of, a Jewish community that keeps rabbinically kosher . Another is where hospitality requires it because a guest whom we wish to accommodate keeps some level of kashrut , and will be constrained in what he can eat at our table if we serve meat and dairy at the same meal. Still a third is where (while recognizing our liberty to do otherwise) keeping kosher helps us in maintaining our identity as Jews. Although the practice of not mixing milk and meat is most commonly associated with Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, this Mitzvah , with its emphasis on morality, is as applicable to Gentiles as it is to Jews. The only thing that does not apply to a Gentiles is keeping halachically kosher as a help in maintaining Jewish identity (since there is none). The reasoning might, however, apply to K''rovei Yisrael Gentiles who find that keeping halachically kosher is helpful in maintaining their K''rov identity within the Jewish community.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch are almost identical in how they express their two mitzvot - the one that prohibits cooking meat in milk, and the other that prohibits eating meat cooked in milk. Their mitzvot do not specify any specific animal or its age. Since the Scriptures they rely on prohibit the cooking (boiling) but not the eating, they need a rationale for their mitzvot that prohibit the eating. The rationale they offer is that eating meat cooked in milk derives an improper benefit from the prohibited cooking. Meir states that we must not benefit from cooking meat in milk if both the meat and the milk come from kosher animals, but if one or the other is from a non- kosher animal, we may benefit (but, of course, not eat). He also states that we may cook fish or locusts in milk and eat the resulting product. Maimonides speculates that the reason for the Scriptures prohibiting boiling a kid in its mother's milk has to do with idolatrous practices ( Guide to
    the Perplexed 111:48 ); HaChinuch disagrees, but offers no alternative.

  commandment: We are not to eat fat, meat from strangled animals, or food polluted by idols.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The third chapter of Leviticus discusses the procedure for peace offerings made by fire to the Lord and, in speaking of the fat of the offerings, Leviticus 3:16-17 states: The cohen will make them go up in smoke on the altar; it is food, an offering made by fire to be a fragrant aroma; all the fat belongs to ADONAI. It is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations wherever you live that you will eat neither fat nor blood. So, the rationale for not eating the fat of an animal is that the parts of the animal that have significant fat belong to God. That is why we offer up the fat to God as food in the Peace Offering, and why we do not eat it ourselves; it belongs to God. I am of the opinion that Leviticus 3 prohibits Jews and K''rovei Yisrael from eating any masses of fat that covers an animal''s inner organs, and any food in which animal fat is the main ingredient. 1 I express no opinion regarding the degree to which incidentally occurring fat must be
    removed from meat, nor do I believe that Scripture prohibits Jews and K''rovei Yisrael from eating marbleized meat (i.e. meat containing embedded particles of fat). Gentiles generally are not prohibited from eating fat, but many abstain for reasons related to health. Although not biblically required, choosing to only purchase rabbinically-certified meat is an easy and automatic way to comply with this Mitzvah as well as with several others having to do with kashrut . The biblical prohibition in Acts 15:19-21 against eating meat from strangled animals and food polluted by idols is often thought of in its context of applying to Gentiles. However, it is clearly applicable to Jews as well; that is what is meant by: For from the earliest times, Moshe has had in every city those who proclaim him, with his words being read in the synagogues every Shabbat. A matter that deserves some discussion, however, is the meaning of the expression " polluted by idols ". Some translations render this "offered
    to idols", or "sacrificed to idols", bringing to mind the ritual slaughter of an animal as part of pagan worship, and then bringing the meat home to eat. This kind of idol worship is rare in the developed world, but still may occur among pagan and satanic cults. We do sometimes encounter restaurants and food markets where there is evidence that the owners engage in idol worship (oriental restaurants especially), and we also encounter " halal " restaurants and markets where the meats are blessed by Muslim clerics in the name of Allah . In my opinion, the former is not a violation of Scripture so long as the food being offered for sale has not been involved in idolatrous rituals. The latter is more problematic and, in my opinion, eating such food should be avoided unless there is nothing else to eat. 1. "Animal fat" does not include the fat in milk. Consequently, butter, cheese, cream, and similar foods are permitted.'
  classical_commentators: 'Meir and HaChinuch interpret Scripture''s prohibition from eating fat as only applying to certain "forbidden" fat ( chelev ). HaChinuch states that there are three kinds: (1) fat attached to the entrails, (2) fat attached to the kidneys, and (3) fat on the loins; he then goes on to make anatomical distinctions in considerable detail. Maimonides makes no distinction as to kinds of fat that are chelev , and kinds that are permitted. HaChinuch explains the prohibition on eating fat by asserting its unhealthy nature. Maimonides and Meir make no attempt at explanation.'

  commandment: We are not to eat blood or anything with the blood still in it.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah to not eat the blood of birds or animals is so important that it applies, not only to Israel (the Jewish people) under the Mosaic Covenant, but to Gentiles as well. Scripture states that the life is in the blood, and it is true in more ways than just biologically. This prohibition of eating blood dates all the way back to Genesis and, although we do not have many details of the animal sacrifices that far back, we can assume that the blood of the animals was poured out in the process of conducting the sacrifice, just as was commanded during the time of Moses. So, the "life in the blood" spoken of in Scripture was not only that of the sacrificed animal, but was also a reference to the life of the person that brought the sacrifice - his mortal life as well as his eternal life. The prohibition of our eating animal blood in the New Covenant is most interesting. Yeshua is our ultimate sacrifice and, according to Matthew 26:28 , His blood was shed on behalf of
    many, so that they may have their sins forgiven. Therefore, now that Yeshua has given his life's blood, it would be wrong for believers in Yeshua to continue to seek forgiveness for our sins and life with God through the blood of animals. That is why Yeshua directed his disciples in Mark 14:23-24 to drink His blood instead. 1 But "why," one may ask, "was the prohibition against eating animal blood begun as early as Genesis?" I believe that it was prophetic. In essence, it was saying that all blood must be respected and not treated as mere food because life is in blood, and one day the Messiah will come and His blood will be poured out for us (figuratively) to eat. In an attempt to extract blood from meat before it is cooked, Orthodox Judaism prescribes a procedure called " kashering " (also called " koshering ") that consists of first soaking the meat in cold water, and then salting the meat with medium-coarse crystals of salt. The procedure is not considered necessary if the meat is
    roasted on an open flame. Clearly, no procedure can remove all blood from meat, so what is God's expectation of us in complying with this Mitzvah ? My opinion is that God wants us to be conscious of blood when we decide what meat to eat, and that he expects us to refrain from eating or drinking whole blood and foods that are intentionally made with blood, or where blood is added (e.g. blood sausage). It is my personal belief that He also expects us to refrain from eating meat from an animal whose blood was not intentionally drained from it at the time of (or soon after) slaughtering it, or killing it in a hunt. Kashering is a noble effort to remove blood from meat, but I do not consider it necessary unless it is to comply with the standards of Jewish Orthodoxy. If that is the reason, there are other considerations as well, such as there being rabbinical supervision of the slaughtering and processing of the resulting meat product. 1. We do not drink Yeshua's blood literally, but figuratively
    through the Shulchan Adonai , as a way of participating in His blood sacrifice.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch all wrote mitzvot prohibiting the eating of blood and quoted Leviticus 7:26 in support. Special Note Curiously, although Leviticus 19:26 is similar to Leviticus 7:26 in prohibiting the eating of blood, the commentators did not use it for that purpose and instead, used it to support an entirely different mitzvah . So in his RN195, for example, Maimonides interprets Leviticus 18:26 to mean that we must not eat or drink to excess and cause the death of a rebellious son by judicial sentence. In MN106, Meir speaks of blood as being the kind of food eaten by a stubborn and rebellious son, that we should not eat a live animal, and that we should pray before we eat. And in C248, HaChinuch speaks of not overeating, and uses many words in trying to show what Leviticus 19:26 has to do with having a rebellious son.

  commandment: It is halachically prescribed that we do not eat the sinew of an animal's thigh.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The statement of this Mitzvah begins "It is halachically prescribed ... rather than "We are to ..." as in other Mitzvot because Genesis 32:33(32) that underlies it is not stated as a commandment; it reads: QuoteParagraph This is why, to this day, the people of Isra''el do not eat the thigh muscle that passes along the hip socket - because the man struck Ya&039;akov&039;s hip at its socket. Although, in Judaism, the above verse of Scripture is halachically treated as a commandment, it cannot be proven to be so because it could merely be saying that between the time of Jacob and the time of Moses (when we assume Genesis was redacted), the community of Israel elected to remember Jacob''s struggle with the "man" by not eating the "sinew of the thigh" ( gid hanasheh or "thigh muscle" in the CJB) of an animal that passes along the hip socket. It is because Jacob''s own thigh muscle was damaged when the "man" with whom he wrestled all night touched his hip socket in order
    to force the contest to an end. 1 The "man''s" identity is shrouded in mystery, but it is apparent that he contained "the fullness of all that God is ..." 2 because Jacob said of him in Genesis 32:31(30) : "I have seen God face to face, yet my life is spared." Whoever the "man" was, it is clear that Jacob spent all night wrestling in the pursuit of a blessing to which God had already committed Himself through His earlier promise to Abraham; nevertheless, the "man" with whom Jacob wrestled declared in Genesis 32:39(28) : "From now on, you will no longer be called Ya''akov, but Isra''el; because you have shown your strength to both God and men and have prevailed." While the apparent complement was given for Jacob''s tenacious pursuit of the godly objective of acquiring a blessing, it was unnecessary for him to be injured in the process of acquiring it, and he wouldn''t have been, had he trusted God''s promise (about which he knew) instead of trying to extract the blessing through his own
    strength. It was a characteristic of Jacob to act in the flesh, and it was not the first time that he sought God''s blessing through fleshly means ( Genesis 27:1-35 ). It is worthy of note that Jacob did not win the wrestling match, and the "man" (who was clearly a supernatural being) did not lose it since he clearly could have killed Jacob had he wanted to. Many in today''s Jewish community comply with Jewish law and custom by not eating the sinew of an animal''s hip ( Genesis 32:33(32) ), but we also understand the Scripture''s twofold lesson for us, which is: (1) like Jacob, we must be zealous in our pursuit of godly things; but (2) unlike Jacob, we must do so in faith, and in reliance on God''s strength - not on our own. We must submit to God and not wrestle with Him, lest He have to disable us as He did Jacob. There are many Scriptures that teach this principle; I will list but a few here: Zechariah 4:6b ''Not by force, and not by power, but by my Spirit,'' says ADONAI-Tzva''ot.
    Psalm 105:4 Seek ADONAI and his strength; always seek his presence. Proverbs 3:5-6 Trust in ADONAI with all your heart; do not rely on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him; then he will level your paths. Ephesians 6:10 Finally, grow powerful in union with the Lord, in union with his mighty strength! Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through him who gives me power. James 4:7 Therefore, submit to God. Moreover, take a stand against the Adversary, and he will flee from you. There is a practical problem to overcome when we seek to abstain from eating meat from an animal''s thigh unless we purchase our meat exclusively from a kosher source (the origin of chopped beef or "hamburger" from non- kosher sources is often not labeled and is unknown). Kosher meat is not always available, so the next simplest solution in attemptingto comply with halachah is to learn the cuts of meat that come from an animal''s hind quarter (sometimes referred to as non- kosher cuts) and avoid
    them. There is, however, another but more laborious solution, which is for the consumer or the butcher to search for and remove all sinew-like structures in meat that comes from an animal''s thigh; these would include veins, nerves, tendons, and cartilage. God does not expect the average person to be an anatomist or have the time to do it, so I am confident that making a reasonable effort to avoid eating meat from an animal''s hind quarter is sufficient, although not required unless ascribing to a community''s standard that seeks to build a fence around the Torah . Interestingly, Orthodox halachah sometimes establishes an even greater fence around the Torah by prohibiting the consumption of meat from behind an animal''s 13th rib, which is the entire rear half of the animal - not just the hind quarter. There is one more issue that needs to be thought of whenever we depart from halachic kashrut , and that is how it may affect our hospitality to guests who keep rabbinically kosher . There
    is no one solution I can recommend other than to inquire of our guests'' needs and do our best to comply. It is sometimes expedient to avoid serving meat altogether. 1. Scholars argue over exactly what the gid hanasheh was, some calling it "muscle", others "nerve", and still others "tendon". For most practical purposes it does not matter, because the laws of kashrut require that all visible nerves, tendons, and veins be removed from the hind quarter of an animal if the hind quarter is to be used for food. Because such preparation is often cost-prohibitive, it is the common Jewish practice (except where food is scarce) to not eat the hind quarter of an animal at all. 2. See Colossians 2:9 (CJB).'
  classical_commentators: The translators into English of Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch that I consulted, all translate gid hanasheh as "the sinew of the thigh vein." Meir says that there are two sinews - an inner one that is near the hip socket, and another that is further away. He says that the inner one is the subject of the Torah prohibition, and the other cannot be eaten either as a result of rulings of the Sages. Of the three, HaChinuch is the only one who attempts to explain the underlying reason for the mitzvah , but draws conclusions that both exceed and contradict the biblical text. He says, for example, that the man who wrestled with Jacob was Esau's (not Jacob's) guardian angel, and he was attempting to extirpate Jacob and his progeny from the world. When he did not succeed, he caused Jacob pain by dislocating his hip. HaChinuch says that this is predictive of Esau and his descendants (the Arabs) 3 seeking to eradicate and inflict pain upon the Children of Israel, that they
    will not succeed, and that when the Messiah comes, Israel will be healed. 3. Esau, the elder son of Isaac, married his cousin Machalat, the daughter of Ishmael.

  commandment: We may eat from either a hunted or a slaughtered bird or animal, but are forbidden to eat from an animal that was killed by beasts in the field or that died of its own accord. Whether slaughtered or hunted, the creature's blood must be poured out and, if it is an animal, its young must not be slaughtered with it on the same day. If it is a mother bird sitting on chicks or eggs, the chicks may be taken, but the mother bird must be released. 1
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah joins together into one, all the commandments in Scripture that address the hunting and slaughtering ( sh''chitah ) of animals and birds for food 3 . It illuminates the compassion and mercy God has for His created creatures, and the holiness he requires of His people. Although hunting and slaughtering for food are permitted, the harvested creature''s blood must be poured out at the time of its death in order for its meat to be considered kosher . This is specifically commanded in Leviticus 17:13 in the case of hunting, and in Deuteronomy 12:15-16 , 23 and 15:20-23 in the case of slaughtering; its purpose is to comply with the Scriptures that forbid us from eating blood. 4 Each way of harvesting an animal or bird has its own challenges. The kosher way of sh''chitah (practiced by the ancients for centuries) is to cut the neck of the creature in such a way that its blood pours out, thereby fulfilling this Mitzvah automatically. The wound that results from
    hunting, on the other hand, rarely causes the animal''s or bird''s blood to pour from its body, so it must be bled as a separate and intentional act. An animal or bird that dies of its own accord ( n''veilah ) or is killed by a wild beast in the field ( t''reifah ) may not be eaten because there is no way to bleed it, and no way to know how long it has been dead nor the state of its former health. If it died of its own accord, the latter is of obvious concern. The prohibition against slaughtering an animal together with its young on the same day ( Leviticus 22:28 ) is a mitzvah of compassion that is reflective of God&'' compassion for His creatures. An analogous act of compassion is commanded by Deuteronomy 22:6-7 , which forbids us from taking a mother bird who is sitting on chicks or eggs; the chicks may be taken, but the mother bird must be let go. In today''s developed world, most of us do not slaughter or hunt for our meat; instead, we rely on professional slaughterers and butchers
    and, unless they are rabbinically supervised, we have little control over what methods of slaughter and bleeding may have been used. One solution is to only purchase kosher meat; if that is not feasible, we ought to make some inquiry into how the animals we purchase are slaughtered and their meat processed. While certain procedures (such as shock or bolt stunning) used to render an animal senseless prior to slaughtering might not satisfy rabbinical standards of sh''chitah , bleeding it immediately after it is stunned would probably satisfy the biblical standard. Acts 15:27-29 reinforces Genesis 9:3-4 (part of the Noahic Law) in making it clear that Gentiles are not to eat meat with the blood still in it, in much the same way as Jews are commanded to not to eat blood under the Law of Moses 5 . There is a common misinterpretation of these Scriptures which are often said to mean that one must not eat the limb of a living animal. Certainly one must not, but the prohibition is much broader
    than that; it is against the eating of any blood 6 . In my opinion, both Jews and Gentiles are held to the same biblical standard of not eating blood, which includes not eating meat from an animal in which the blood has not been poured out. As for the other requirements of this Mitzvah , they are mandated for Jews and K''rovei Yisrael , and strongly recommended for other Gentiles. Ritual slaughter (other than bleeding) is not biblically required for either Jews or Gentiles. 1. Except in the case of Genesis 9:3-4 , all animals and birds referred to in this Mitzvah are assumed to be kosher . 2. This commandment is part of the Noahic Law that was intended for Gentiles and given prior to the Law of Moses. 3. A slaughterer is known as a shochet . 4. Fish are exempt from the requirements. 5. Under the New Covenant as well. 6. Since meat cannot be divested of all traces of blood, see Mitzvah # K4 for efforts that may be taken to reduce its blood to an acceptable minimum.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and Chinuch agree that Genesis 9:3-4 and Deuteronomy 12:23 forbid us to eat the limb or flesh cut from a living animal. They acquire this interpretation from Chulin 102b of the Talmud despite the fact that the Scriptures do not say that at all. They also associate these Scriptures with Exodus 22:30(31) , which commands us to not eat the flesh of an animal that has been torn by wild beasts in the field. Maimonides, Meir, and Chinuch state that we are forbidden to eat an animal that has died of its own accord ( n'veilah ), and Meir adds that n'veilah includes meat from an animal that was not properly slaughtered. All three commentators take the position that Deuteronomy 12:21 teaches that ritual slaughter is required of all animals or birds that one wishes to eat, and none of the commentators allow for eating a hunted animal or bird - even if its blood is first poured out. This is probably one of the most extreme of the rabbinical fences placed around
    the Torah in that it adversely affects many in the world who must hunt in order to eat. Consistent with this view, the commentators interpret Leviticus 17:13 as applying to ritual slaughter when, in fact, the actual subject of the Scripture is hunting. HaChinuch says that fish and locusts need not be ritually slaughtered. How one slaughters a locust he does not say.

  commandment: We are to receive, hold, and occupy the Land of Israel.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures quoted above clearly show that the Land of Israel was given to the Children of Israel (the Jewish people) as a main component of God''s covenant with Abraham. Those that say otherwise (principally Islamic Arabs and their supporters) are contradicting both the Holy Scriptures and the writings of their revered "prophet" Mohammed. Because God gave the Land of Israel to the Jews, it is sinful to deny it to them and a mitzvah to support them in the Land. There are many ways to give that support. Some Jews are called to make Aliyah (emigrate) to Israel and become part of Israeli Jewish society, while others remain among the nations (the diaspora) and contribute by donating and raising money for Israel, by visiting Israel to work on kibbutzim , by participating in humanitarian causes that benefit Israel and its citizens, and by praying in accordance with Psalm 122:6-9 : Pray for shalom in Yerushalayim; may those who love you prosper. May shalom be within your
    ramparts, prosperity in your palaces. For the sake of my family and friends, I say, "Shalom be within you!" For the sake of the house of ADONAI our God, I will seek your well-being. There is a caveat associated with this Mitzvah , and that is that we must distinguish between supporting Israel''s right to exist and thrive on the one hand, and supporting the politics of its secular government on the other. Because God''s hand is on Israel it is often right in its political decisions, but not always because it is not yet fully submitted to God and Messiah. In faith, that will come soon, but meanwhile we must seek divine discernment for how to pray and how to support.'

  commandment: We are to bless and not curse the Jewish People.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'We see from the Scriptures presented that the people of Israel - the Jewish People - are God''s chosen people (He calls them sons) and therefore blessed and protected by Him. His protection at any point in time is conditioned on Israel''s obedience to Him but, it transcends the times of their punishment, and returns when Israel repents. But it is for God to judge and punish Israel when He deems it needed, and not for anyone else. Even when God used an enemy nation to punish Israel, he did so by using a nation that deserved and was destined for punishment itself because it was already hostile to Israel. To bring the matter more up to date, the Apostle Paul said in Romans 11:7-8 : What follows is that Isra''el has not attained the goal for which she is striving. The ones chosen have obtained it, but the rest have been made stonelike, just as the Tanakh says, ''God has given them a spirit of dullness - eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, right down to the
    present day.'' More and more, the Jewish people are having the scales of blindness fall from their eyes and are receiving Yeshua, and it would therefore be well to remember what Paul also said in Romans 11:25-27 : For, brothers, I want you to understand this truth which God formerly concealed but has now revealed, so that you won''t imagine you know more than you actually do. It is that stoniness, to a degree, has come upon Isra''el, until the Gentile world enters in its fullness; and that it is in this way that all Isra''el will be saved. As the Tanakh says, ''Out of Tziyon will come the Redeemer; he will turn away ungodliness from Ya''akov and this will be my covenant with them ... when I take away their sins.'' In view of that and all else that has been presented, it would behoove both individuals and nations to receive the blessing and not the cursing that is promised for blessing and not cursing the Jewish people.'

  commandment: We are not to exclude Gentiles from being part of the Jewish Community.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah prohibits excluding Gentiles from Jewish communities. A Jewish community that is the kind of which I am speaking has Jewish members, governing and pastoral leaders, organized prayer that is culturally Jewish, Bible and/or Torah studies, table fellowship, an adherence to biblical halachah as it applies to Jews, and a shared Jewish style of life. Even a casual perusal of the Scriptures presented in this Mitzvah will demonstrate that, throughout Jewish history, there have always been Gentiles that resided alongside, and participated with, their Jewish brothers within Jewish communities. So close was the communal relationship between Jews and gerim (committed Gentiles) during the Mosaic Covenant era, that God provided for there to be an inheritance of land given to Gentiles that was within the territory of a tribe with whom a Gentile was living ( Ezekiel 47:21-23 ). The relationship gets even closer in the New Covenant where, according to Romans 11:16-18 ,
    Gentile believers in Yeshua become connected to their Messianic Jewish brothers and to the Jewish people globally by figuratively being grafted into, and becoming branches on, a cultivated olive tree that is owned by Israel (the Jewish people): Now if the hallah offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole loaf. And if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you - a wild olive - were grafted in among them and have become equal sharers in the rich root of the olive tree, then don''t boast as if you were better than the branches! However, if you do boast, remember that you are not supporting the root, the root is supporting you. We know that the olive tree into which Gentile believers are grafted belongs to Israel because we read in Romans 11:24 : For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their
    [Israel''s] own olive tree! What is more, we read in Ephesians 2:11-14 : Therefore, remember your former state: you Gentiles by birth - called the Uncircumcised by those who, merely because of an operation on their flesh, are called the Circumcised - at that time had no Messiah. You were estranged from the national life of Isra''el. [Commonwealth of Israel in the New King James translation] You were foreigners to the covenants embodying God''s promise. You were in this world without hope and without God. But now, you who were once far off have been brought near through the shedding of the Messiah''s blood. For he himself is our shalom - he has made us both one and has broken down the m''chitzah [middle wall of separation] which divided us ... Another reason that Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish communities is the matter of table fellowship and hospitality of Jews to Gentiles that is exemplified in the following Scriptures: John 4:7-10 A woman from Shomron [ a Gentile ] came
    to draw some water; and Yeshua said to her, "Give me a drink of water." (His talmidim had gone into town to buy food.) The woman from Shomron said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, ask for water from me, a woman of Shomron?" (For Jews don''t associate with people from Shomron.) Yeshua answered her, "If you knew God''s gift, that is, who it is saying to you, ''Give me a drink of water,'' then you would have asked him; and he would have given you living water." Acts 10:25-28 As Kefa entered the house, Cornelius [ a Gentile ] met him and fell prostrate at his feet. But Kefa pulled him to his feet and said, "Stand up! I myself am just a man." As he talked with him, Kefa went inside and found many people gathered. He said to them, "You are well aware that for a man who is a Jew to have close association with someone who belongs to another people, or to come and visit him, is something that just isn''t done. But God has shown me not to call any person common or unclean" Hebrews 13:2 (NAS)
    Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers [ presumably includes Gentiles ], for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it. Still another reason that Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish communities is the application of Matthew 7:12 (see also, Luke 6:31 ): Always treat others as you would like them to treat you; that sums up the teaching of the Torah and the Prophets. And even another (and perhaps the best) reason for Jews to not exclude Gentiles from their communities is that it is God''s plan for Jews and Gentiles to worship side-by-side at the end of times. We see this in Revelation 7:9-10 : After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language [ Jews & Gentiles ]. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands; and they shouted, "Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
    Would we think it proper for a Gentile community to exclude Jews? There were many such communities in the United States in the past, but thankfully there no longer are - at least officially. While Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish congregations and other Jewish community entities, there are some situations where Jews caucusing with Jews may be appropriate - a Jewish discussion group on Jewish topics for example. I do believe it is important for Jewish disciples of Yeshua to fellowship in communities where their Jewish identities, life patterns, and covenant responsibilities are encouraged. For that reason, Gentiles that join and commit themselves to a Messianic Jewish congregation should adopt the congregation''s Jewish ways of being, and not try to influence it to become Christian in culture. That notwithstanding, some aspects of Torah apply differently to Jews and Gentiles. Perhaps this Mitzvah can best be summarized by Psalms 133:1 : Oh, how good, how pleasant it is for
    brothers to live together in harmony. In the New Covenant, Jewish and Gentile believers in Yeshua are brothers and sisters in the Lord and should therefore live together in harmony wherever they choose to worship. 1 1. Daniel C. Juster, Jewish Roots: A Foundation of Biblical Theology (Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image Publishers, 1995).'
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the classical commentators.
  commentary_juster: I should like to add perspective to the preceding section 6, " Gentiles who live among Jews allowed to eat the Passover lamb if circumcised " ( Exodus 12:43-49 ). There is a change of application in the New Covenant where Gentiles are not encouraged to be circumcised in order to eat the Passover. Yeshua is now our Passover Lamb, and we share the Lamb together in the Lord's Supper without Gentiles having to be circumcised. The teaching of the New Covenant is that Gentiles are fully included without circumcision, contrary to the orientation of the Mosaic era. There are promises and commands that both share equally while, at the same time, distinctions of calling are preserved and lived out in different ways ( Romans 11:28-29 ). Both share in an equality of priestly status ( Ephesians 2:5 ; 1 Peter 2:10 ) with different out-workings of their respective priestly callings. An example of this is the general calling of the Jewish people to respond to God's promise of their
    return to the Land of Israel, and to the events leading to the Messianic Days. A Social Caveat There are certain groups where the inclusion of one class of persons and the exclusion of all others is socially acceptable. Examples of these are age-specific groups such as men's and women's Bible studies, B'nei Mitzvah classes, and married couples discussion groups. There are also specific nationality and racial groups that are formed out of their common interests, but their acceptability is usually due to their having a minority status. So, for example, a Hispanic discussion group might be acceptable, whereas an all-white discussion group almost certainly would not be. The problem of social unacceptability surfaces most clearly when persons of a specific race, religion, color, or ethnic origin, are excluded from a community of the kind where people live, work, and worship together.

  commandment: We are to pursue righteousness, i.e. determining what is right and doing it.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Righteousness is the quality of being morally right or justifiable. A righteous man always seeks to do what is right but, if he errs in innocence, he remains righteous because his character in desiring to do right is unchanged. Similarly but opposite, a man of unrighteous character can stumble into doing things that are right from time to time but, if his character is unchanged, he remains unrighteous. This Mitzvah anticipates times when doing the right thing seem risky due to possible adverse consequences that we foresee and fear, or at least would prefer to avoid. At such times of decision we are tempted to disregard what we know is right and, instead, do what seems safest. The foregoing Scriptures call us instead to faith, and to three simple steps: (1) Determine what''s right; (2) Do it; (3) Trust God to take care of the consequences. These steps are exemplified by Esther''s heroism in Esther 4:7-16 , and are the natural follow-through from 2 Corinthians 5:7 that
    reminds us: for we live by trust, not by what we see. Or, as the New King James Version translates the Greek: We walk by faith, not by sight. The Bible, beginning to end, describes the righteous character of God, and exhorts us to aspire to be like him - righteous. There are so many Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah that I have elected to save space by printing out the text of those from the Torah and the Gospel books, and only citing the others by chapter and verse.'

  commandment: We are to consider the biblical principles of war and apply them where possible.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures quoted herein include those that are referred to by Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch to support their respective mitzvot about the waging of war. Nevertheless, because conditions today (whether in Israel or elsewhere in the world) are different than during the time of Moses, we cannot and should not seek to apply the commandments literally. That notwithstanding, even those commandments that we deem obsolete contain principles that are helpful and even applicable today, hence the title of this Mitzvah "Biblical Principles of War", and my brief attempt to highlight some of them: TAKING A CENSUS The census of men twenty years of age and over who were subject to military service referred to in Numbers 1:2-3 , has its counterpart in the U.S. Selective Service System and in military conscription programs in other countries as well. Its purpose is to assess military readiness in case a call to arms is needed. EXCLUSION OF LEVITES FROM MILITARY SERVICE The Levites
    had priestly duties that had to continue during military campaigns and they were therefore excluded from the fighting. Today, there are no priests and a portable Tabernacle for them to care for, but the United States does recognize the special calling of ordained ministers by excusing them from compulsory military service. What is more, ordained ministers that volunteer to serve as military chaplains are excluded from fighting alongside the troops to whom they minister. ORDINARY MEN EXEMPT FROM MILITARY SERVICE Israelite men were exempt from military service if they had recently planted a vineyard of fruit, if they were engaged to marry, if they were a new husband, and if they were afraid. At various times since World War II, American men were deferred from the Selective Service System''s draft if they were a full-time student, if they were married, if they had a young a child, and if they had certain medical conditions or disabilities. At earlier times in U.S. history, men could buy
    their way out of military service, or be excused by providing a substitute replacement. OCCUPYING CONQUERED LANDS The Israelites had to cross over the Jordan and possess the lands that they conquered. Overpowering their adversaries was not enough; actual possession was required. We in the U.S. sometimes forget that principle in wars of today where we strike a blow and then pull back for fear that we will be accused of being called conquerors. Not only do we refrain from possessing the land we take in battle, we pay to restore it and give it back to our former enemies. NOT BEING AFRAID There was a reason that the Israelites were not to be afraid, and that is that God was fighting on their side. We have no such guarantee in a secular nation that goes to war without first inquiring of God. APPOINTMENT OF MILITARY COMMANDERS In ancient Israel, commanders were appointed from the ranks just before battles, whereas in the modern world, commanders are usually appointed from a pool of professionally
    trained soldiers. Early in U.S. history men of means could purchase a military command, and there have also been occasions when appointment as an officer (including a commanding officer) was made based on political considerations. MARRYING WOMEN PRISONERS According to Scripture, a man could take a woman prisoner as his wife as though she were his chattel. In some parts of the world that may still be the case but, in the western countries, women must consent to marriage. TAKING THE POSSESSIONS OF A CONQUERED ENEMY AS BOOTY There were occasions when ancient Israelite soldiers were allowed (even commanded) to take for themselves the possessions of those whom they conquered. There were also times recorded in Scripture when they were commanded not to take possessions, and to destroy them instead. Taking booty in modern wars is discouraged but still happens - especially in third world countries. GUARDING AGAINST SICKNESS & MAINTAINING SANITATION Isolating those who are sick and maintaining
    sanitary conditions within military camps are as necessary today as they were in ancient Israel. MEN WHO WILL NOT FIGHT At all times in history there were those who, when called to serve in the military, have refused. Those who were fearful were sometimes excused on the premise that they posed a danger to their fighting comrades, and sometimes they were punished. In the U.S. in modern times, religious conscientious objectors were allowed to perform alternative civilian service, and others who refused were prosecuted. ESTABLISHING LASTING PEACE Establishing lasting peace has always been a goal of mankind even while seeking to achieve it through war. As Isaiah 2:3-5 states: Then they will hammer their swords into plow-blades and their spears into pruning-knives; nations will not raise swords at each other, and they will no longer learn war.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides' and HaChinuch's mitzvot about war are literal extractions from the Bible, while Meir wrote relatively little on the subject.

  commandment: We are to resist, & not yield to, temptation to sin.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'God''s first commandment ever was His instruction to Adam and Eve to not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve was tempted by the serpent to eat of the tree and she did, and she tempted Adam, and he ate as well. That is what is often referred to as the "original sin", and one of its consequences is that mankind has been plagued by temptation to sin ever since. We have lost our innocence of not knowing evil and there is no longer the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to tempt us, but other temptations to sin abound. That''s the bad news. The good news is that God has given us Yeshua, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the New Covenant which, together, are more than adequate to keep us from falling into temptation and committing sin. The two Scriptures that are most relevant are 1 Corinthians 10:13 and James 4:7 . The first assures us that God will not allow us to be tempted beyond our ability to cope, and that He will, in addition, always provide
    a means of escape. The second Scripture assures us that Satan cannot lodge within us, or continue to harass us, if we summon the power given us by God and resist. Notice that neither Scripture calls us to passivity. The first requires that we search for and employ the means of escape provided for us, and the second requires that we actively resist the sin of which we are tempted, by emphatically saying "no!" to it. If we do those things we are promised victory, and even should we fail at times, 1 John 1:9 promises us: If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he is trustworthy and just, he will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing.'

  commandment: We are to keep our promises.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah "Keeping Our Promises" is a generalization of several more specific mitzvot promulgated by the Classical Commentators Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch having to do with keeping oral commitments, and delaying or revoking vows. In addition to the Torah Scriptures, our obligation to keep our promises appears to also be the message of Matthew 5:33-37 and James 5:12 , their general rule being: ... let your ''Yes'' be simply ''Yes'' and your ''No'' simply ''No''. James advises against swearing oaths to emphasize one''s truthfulness. The expectation is that whatever New Covenant believers say ought to be so trustworthy that, except for society''s requirement of submission to judicial authorities and its laws pertaining to certain legal documents, we should avoid swearing oaths. It is part of the intensification of Torah in the New Covenant. The literal application of Numbers 30:4-16(3-15) was operative under the Mosaic Covenant in ancient Israel when women had
    fewer legal rights than men, and their fathers or husbands could intercede to nullify their vows made to God and others. That may continue to be the secular law in various places of the world today, and it is the prevailing secular law today that parents can nullify contracts made by their minor children, and guardians can nullify commitments made by those who are adjudicated legally incompetent. It should not have to be said (but I will say it), that under the New Covenant (also under today''s Anglo-American law), adult women are no longer legally subordinate to their fathers and husbands as they were in the past.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch limit their mitzvot to promises made orally, although one can infer that they encompass written contracts as well. Maimonides recognizes exceptions to the general rule in the case of wives and daughters who are under the authority of their husbands and fathers respectively. Meir makes no exception for women in his mitzvot , but cites the Talmudic rule that allows an "expert scholar" or three "ordinary persons" to release a "man" from a vow that he has made and subsequently regrets. HaChinuch cites the Talmudic rule but states that, according to Maimonides, it should not be listed among the compilation of mitzvot . He then goes on to expound the rule and describes four situations in which a man should be released from his vow. Of the three commentators mentioned, HaChinuch treats the subject far more in depth than the other two.

  commandment: We are to tell the truth and not lie.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'It is clear from the foregoing Scriptures (and others not cited) that truth-telling is a commanded virtue, and that the opposite of truth-telling (lying) is a sin. We know that truth-telling is a godly attribute because in Numbers 23:19 , when under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Balaam said to Balak: God is not a human who lies or a mortal who changes his mind. When he says something, he will do it; when he makes a promise, he will fulfill it. In complete contrast to God who does not lie, John 8:44 quotes Yeshua (scolding a group of Judeans out to kill Him) as saying that Satan is the original liar; we read: You belong to your father, Satan, and you want to carry out your father''s desires. From the start he was a murderer, and he has never stood by the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he is speaking in character; because he is a liar - indeed, the inventor of the lie! This appears to be a reference to Genesis 3:2-4 where Satan (in
    the form of a serpent) lies to Eve about eating from the tree " in the middle of the garden " and says to her: It is not true that you will surely die ... In my stating categorically that lying is a sin, I believe I should address the often-debated Scripture passages in which Abraham and Isaac were less than candid in admitting that Sarah and Rebecca respectively were their wives; they are: Genesis 20:2 Avraham was saying of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister"; so Avimelekh king of G''rar sent and took Sarah. and Genesis 26:7 The men of the place asked him about his wife, and out of fear he said, "She is my sister." He thought, "If I tell them she''s my wife, they might kill me in order to take Rivkah. After all, she is a beautiful woman." Apologists for Abraham sometimes use Abraham''s convoluted explanation in Genesis 20:12 to try to show that Abraham didn''t lie because Sarah was not only Abraham''s wife, but also his half-sister. The same explanation cannot, however, be made for Isaac
    and, the truth be told, both men lapsed in their faith, fearing for themselves and for their wives. Then there is the occasion where Rebecca and Jacob conspired to deceive Isaac into blessing Jacob instead of Esau. It is one of the unique aspects of the Scriptures, that God allows us to see the foibles of even the greatest of the patriarchs.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch listed mitzvot on various aspects of honesty, but did not write one that generalizes that we must tell the truth and not lie. For example, Maimonides listed (1) not withholding evidence from a court; (2) not bearing false witness and punishing those who do; (3) not prophesying falsely; (4) not committing fraud by moving land boundaries; (5) not swearing falsely to avoid paying our debts; and (6) not using or keeping dishonest weights and measures. The closest that the classical commentators come to writing a general mitzvah on truth-telling is their use of Leviticus 19:14 to say that we must not cause anyone to stumble by giving misleading or wrong advice. Leviticus 19:14 actually speaks of not cursing a deaf person or placing an obstacle in the path of a blind person; therefore, in constructing their respective mitzvot , the commentators have not treated deafness and blindness as physical disabilities, but rather as conditions of
    lacking sufficient information to make safe and appropriate judgments.

  commandment: We are to return anything we find which was lost by another. If he is not near us or we do not know who he is, we are to keep it safe for him until he claims it.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: The Deuteronomy verses that support this Mitzvah speak of an item lost by a brother. Nevertheless, Exodus 23:4 and general principles of morality strongly suggest that it must apply to a non-brother as well - even an enemy - for otherwise, the finder would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the loser. It is therefore logical that if the finder knows the loser and does not return the article, his omission amounts to constructive theft. Deuteronomy 22:2 contains a departure from many secular laws today that permit a finder of lost property to take ownership of it if it is not claimed within a specified period of time. Scripture forbids a person from ever claiming title to a lost item, even if the owner is unknown or at a great distance so that return would be impractical. The finder must keep the item safe, and take reasonable steps to discover its owner. It is significant that some state governments today also prohibit the finder of property from keeping it, by providing
    that certain kinds of unclaimed property escheats to the state if the owner does not come forth to claim it within a prescribed period of time. There are no New Covenant Scriptures that speak directly of finding and returning lost property, but Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31 should nevertheless apply.
  classical_commentators: 'Meir and Maimonides differ in their opinion as to whether our obligation related to lost property applies to non-brothers (i.e. Gentiles); Meir restricts his mitzvot to Jews who find the property of other Jews, while Maimonides makes no such distinction. Neither Maimonides, nor Meir, nor Hachinuch include Deuteronomy 22:2 as a reference source for their respective mitzvot . HaChinuch says that we must return property belonging to a brother Jew, but he also quotes Sages who say that found property that has no identifying features need not be returned. Examples of such property are: scattered fruit, scattered money, small bundles of grain in a public area, round packets of pressed figs, strings of fish, pieces of meat, and similar items. The rationale for this is that when one loses these kinds of items, the owner gives up the hope of retrieving them, and thereby loses his right of ownership.'

  commandment: We are not to commit murder or other unjustifiable homicide.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures that teach against murder appear to be of two kinds - the majority of them speak only of killing the physical body, and a few of them hint at a non-physical kind of murder - hostility in one''s heart to one''s brother. Of all the Scriptures on murder, Exodus 20:13 is the most well-known because it is among the "Ten Commandments". Murder (the intentional unrighteous killing of a human being) is universally perceived to be wrong, even by those who do not believe in God; it is what secularists may sometimes call "natural law". God Himself does not kill with impunity either. He values those whom He has created in His image and, when men do otherwise to their fellow men with intention, God deems it evil as though they are seeking to destroy God Himself. We see this clearly in Genesis 9:6 , which associates murder with destroying God''s image; it reads: Whoever sheds human blood, by a human being will his own blood be shed; for God made human beings in his
    image. Perhaps the same rationale explains 1 John 3:15 that extends the sin of murder to hating one''s brother, for it says: Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him. Seeking to kill a man who is created in God''s image is akin to coming against God Himself, and is quite the opposite of receiving Him as Lord and Messiah by which we are saved. In a similar way, Matthew 5:22 states: But I tell you that anyone who nurses anger against his brother will be subject to judgment; that whoever calls his brother, ''You good-for-nothing!'' will be brought before the Sanhedrin; that whoever says, ''Fool!'' incurs the penalty of burning in the fire of Gei-Hinnom! Murder, probably because of its permanently destructive nature, is presented as the quintessential opposite of loving our neighbor for, as Romans 13:10 states: Love does not do harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fullness of Torah. In the Bible, the penalty for murder is always
    death. That notwithstanding, the biblical law (similar to modern secular law) recognizes a category of justifiable killing and also unjustifiable killing that is a lesser crime than murder (terms used today are "murder in the second degree", "manslaughter", "negligent homicide", etc.). Murder is ordinarily distinguished from these lesser offenses by whether there was intention, deliberation, premeditation, provocation, and malice. Examples of justifiable killing are self-defense and killing in battle. Culpability in the case of accidental killing has to do with whether or not negligence contributed to the death. Not precisely analogous but interestingly, whereas modern systems of justice typically employ imprisonment as a penalty for these lesser categories of homicide, the biblical law provides cities of refuge to which a man who has killed another (excluding intentional murder) might flee to avoid being seized upon and killed by the deceased''s vengeful relatives.'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'' mitzvah commands against murder (physical killing), references Sanhedrin 9 and Makkoth 2 , and prescribes death by beheading. Meir prescribes beheading as well, but only if the murder is by the perpetrator''s own hand. If he only caused the death, he is not punishable by a bet din but only by "Heaven''s hands". Ironically, this may even be the case if one pays another to commit murder. Meir also opines that if one kills even a single Jewish person, it is as though he slew the entire world. HaChinuch begins with citing Genesis 1:28 : God blessed them: God said to them, ''Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and every living creature that crawls on the earth.'' He sees murder as violating God''s plan that human beings multiply and settle the world. He also cites Proverbs 11:10 and 28:17 as justification for executing murderers. As does Maimonides, HaChinuch references Sanhedrin 9 and
    Makkoth 2 . None of the commentators refer to Genesis 9:6 or suggest a connection between murder and God''s image.'

  commandment: We are not to steal or commit robbery.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Stealing is taking from someone, that to which the taker has no right. One who steals is called a thief. Robbery is similar in that there is an unlawful taking, but it is more severe in that the taking is by force. One who commits robbery is called a robber. The prohibition against stealing is one of the Ten Commandments; stealing and committing robbery are dealt with in separate Scriptures. One might ask why Psalm 62:11(10) calls extortion robbery, since there is no apparent force employed. The answer is that the kind of force which elevates stealing to robbery does not have to be physical force. Coercion and threats are a form of force, in that they achieve their end by evoking fear. It is similar with Leviticus 19:13 , which calls delaying the payment of wages not only theft, but robbery. That is because the employer, in delaying payment to his worker, improperly exercises coercive power he has over his worker - a form of force. Stealing and robbery are not only
    technical sins, but are also moral ones in that the perpetrator is willing to harm another individual. This intentional causing of harm to another automatically violates Leviticus 19:18 : ... love your neighbor as yourself ... as well as a plethora of other Scriptures commanding that we love (and therefore not harm) others. If one is caught stealing, he must pay restitution and, under certain circumstances, must pay several times the restitution. The higher goal, however, is for the thief or robber to experience a heart-change and be moved to repentance even if he is not caught. Zakkai the tax collector is an example of such a man when, touched by the Spirit in Luke 19:8 , blurts out to Yeshua: Here, Lord, I am giving half of all I own to the poor; and if I have cheated anyone, I will pay him back four times as much. Yeshua responds in verse 9 : Today salvation has come to this house, inasmuch as this man too is a son of Avraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and save what was lost.
    This same need for heartfelt repentance is expressed in Ephesians 4:28 which instructs the thief to stop stealing and, instead, to earn honest money that he can "share with those in need". A noted writer Jay E. Adams asks rhetorically: "When is a thief not a thief? When he stops stealing?" 1 Then he answers his own question: "No, if the only thing a thief has done is to stop stealing, he remains a thief who, at the moment, is not stealing." Adams goes on to explain that it takes a repentant change of heart for a thief to become an honest man; only then is he no longer a thief. 1. Jay E. Adams, "The Christian Counselor''s Manual", p. 178, (Phillipsburg, NJ: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, 1973).'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat their respective mitzvot similarly to one another. They command against stealing or robbing, and discuss the amount of restitution that is required under various circumstances. They do not, however, address theft and robbery in terms of their inherent immorality, or suggest that there is a requirement that the offender repent. There is an unusual application (by all three classical commentators) of the Exodus 20 Scriptures that prohibit stealing in that they do not discuss them in connection with the stealing of property, but rather regarding kidnapping - the stealing of people - and, in particular, Jewish people. This is strange, not only because the immorality of kidnapping human beings is self-evident, but also because Exodus 21:16 and Deuteronomy 24:7 that specifically prohibit kidnapping are not dealt with in any of the classical mitzvah compilations.

  commandment: Our institutions are to promote economic equity.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah addresses our governmental, societal, and religious institutions (e.g. our national and local governments, our congregations, our families, etc.), regarding their contributions to the financial equity for us that God intends. Financial equity is not the same thing as financial equality; equity is fairness in opportunity, and God addresses this most clearly in Deuteronomy 8:18 when He says to the Israelites: No, you are to remember ADONAI your God, because it is he who is giving you the power to get wealth, in order to confirm his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as is happening even today. The "power to get wealth" spoken of in the Scripture is financial opportunity, but Scripture is clear that not all of us will achieve wealth, for Yeshua said in Matthew 26:11a : The poor you will always have with you ... Exodus 21:2-6 , Exodus 23:10-12 , Leviticus 25:2-34 , and Deuteronomy 15:1-18 , contain commandments that redistributed monetary wealth and
    restored land to its original Israelite owners every seven years (the Sh''mitah - the Sabbatical year) and every fifty years (the Jubilee year - also a Sh''mitah ) respectively. They also command forgiving debts and releasing slaves on Sh''mitah , and the Sh''mitah is a year of rest (analogous to the weekly Sabbath) when the Israelites, along with their land and animals, were required to cease from work. It was a year when all (including those who were poor) could eat from what grew of its own accord, that was the result of the prior six years of cultivation. Food could be gathered but not methodically harvested; the latter was considered working the land, whereas the former was not. These Scriptures, especially those about the Sh''mitah and the year of Jubilee ( Yovel ), difficult as they are with which to comply in today''s society, remind us that it is God (and not we) who owns the land and other forms of worldly wealth and, if we acquire them, we are required to periodically return
    them so that other individuals and other generations may have similar opportunity. This is especially emphasized by the requirement that all land sales must be with a right of redemption by either the one who sells it or his kin. Some argue against the foregoing by pointing out that the mandated redemption or return is not back to God, but rather back to persons and families that were previously given the land or, in the case of forgiveness of loans, to individual borrowers who had no historic right to retain what they borrowed. What causes all of this to make sense is adding to it the biblical mandate of stewardship. God ultimately owns everything, and we are mere trustees of what He owns and entrusts to us for a time. Our property, both real and personal, is temporary and intended for our own use, and also for the use of others as we are charged with generosity, and compassion for the needs of our neighbors. Whether we are good stewards of God''s wealth depends on how wisely and how
    charitably we use His wealth - how much we use for ourselves as compared to how much of it we use to bless others. While this Mitzvah has ramifications for our personal tithing and tzadakah (charitable giving), its purpose is mainly to mandate that we employ its principle of economic equity in how we manage our various institutions over which we have influence. The relevant Scriptures of the Torah to which I have referred cannot be literally applied today because we are subject to the laws of the secular governments under which we live that almost never make allowance for them. That notwithstanding, God wants us to incorporate the Torah principle of financial equity in the institutions that we control, and wherever else we are able.'
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah , in the general way it is stated, is not addressed by Maimonides, Meir, or HaChinuch. The probable reason is that their mitzvot are drawn solely from the Scriptures of the Mosaic period when economic equity was intrinsically built into Israel's societal and governmental institutions by God, so they felt that constructing a separate mitzvah commanding it was not needed.

  commandment: We are to be humane in exercising our dominion over God's creatures.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is derived from the above Scriptures that teach (specifically or impliedly) that we must have humane compassion for the animals of God''s creation. Since acting cruelly is the opposite of acting humanely, this Mitzvah could have been expressed as "We are not to cruelly treat God''s creatures over which we have dominion." The emphasis on "dominion" (KJV and NKJV) is important in order to clarify that our rule over God''s created animals (as expressed in Genesis 1:26-28 ) is not without limits. We can use animals for our benefit (and may even slay them for appropriate and permitted reasons) but we are not to abuse them since they, as we, have feelings on varying levels of complexity. The most primitive of these feelings are pain, hunger, and procreative urges, but the higher forms of animals have other feelings as well that we call emotions. Although the relevance of each Scripture referenced above is, for the most part, clear on its face, I nevertheless
    offer the following explanatory comments: Exodus 20:9-10 and 23:12 compassionately extend Sabbath rest to our livestock. Exodus 23:5 requires that we help an enemy with his fallen animal, thereby showing compassion for both our enemy and for his animal. Deuteronomy 22:4 is similar and broader in applying, as well, to those who are not our enemies. Exodus 23:10-11 commands that we not cultivate or harvest our land during the Sabbatical Year, so that those who are poor among us (as well as the wild animals in the countryside) can eat from that which grows of its own accord. Exodus 23:19 and 34:26 both state that we must not boil a young goat in its mother''s milk. Interpreting these Scriptures literally leads to the traditional rabbinic prohibition against mixing dairy foods with meat which, I contend, is not their intended meaning. Boiling (perhaps killing in the process) a baby animal using its mother''s milk - milk intended for giving the young animal nourishment and life - is so perverted
    and inherently cruel a use of mother''s milk as to cry out to us: "Do not treat the animals of God''s creation inhumanely as do the heathens." Leviticus 22:28 teaches that slaughtering an animal and her young on the same day is wrong. Why is it wrong? I believe it is because it shows a callous disregard of the parental relationship that is holy even among animals. Deuteronomy 22:6-7 recognizes the probable maternal pain that a mother bird experiences when she sees her eggs or her young taken for our consumption. Releasing the mother bird first, spares her from witnessing the fate of her offspring, and frees her to bear other young to replace those that are lost. Deuteronomy 22:10 reminds us that it is inhumane to yoke together, animals that pull with different strengths, because the stronger of them inevitably drag the weaker. Deuteronomy 25:4 reminds us that it is inhumane to keep an animal from eating in a place where there is a visible and tempting abundance of food. Although human
    beings are among God''s "creatures", this Mitzvah is not intended to apply to human beings because humans do not have dominion over each other.'
  classical_commentators: Notwithstanding the several mitzvot that are presented in support of this Mitzvah , "Being Humane in Our Dominion over God's Creatures" is not among the mitzvot published by Maimonides, Meir, or HaChinuch.

  commandment: We are not to covet or plan to acquire another's property.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Coveting another''s property is desiring it or longing for it. Planning to acquire another''s property is the next step in coveting; it is sin, but falls short of theft or some other way to improperly take the thing coveted into one''s possession. Coveting is not merely saying: "It would be nice to have that thing." It is a desire to have something (that belongs to another) that is so strong that one''s mind dwells on it and how to acquire it through even improper means. The Scriptures are clear that such desire, whether or not accompanied by a plan to acquire it improperly, is sin. Wanting an item that belongs to another and offering to purchase it for a fair price is not prohibited and is not sin unless the longing for it exceeds reason.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch agree with the meanings of "coveting" and "planning to acquire" as stated above.

  commandment: We are to love our neighbor, the stranger among us, and even our enemy.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is sometimes referred to as "Love your neighbor as yourself," and sometimes "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." The "love" alluded to in this Mitzvah is not a love of feeling or emotion, but of doing for others what is best for them because we genuinely care about them. And why should we care about our neighbor, the stranger ( ger ), and our enemy? It is because they, like we, are created by our Heavenly Father and we are, in that sense, brothers and sisters. Moreover, Scripture (e.g. John 3:16 ) tells us that God loves his entire creation so, if we care about God, we must also care about those for whom He cares. Also, the Book of 1 John tells us: 1 John 3:10-11 : Here is how one can distinguish clearly between God''s children and those of the Adversary: everyone who does not continue doing what is right is not from God. Likewise, anyone who fails to keep loving his brother is not from God. 1 John 4:7-9 : Beloved friends, let us love one
    another; because love is from God; and everyone who loves has God as his Father and knows God. Those who do not love, do not know God; because God is love. Here is how God showed his love among us: God sent his only Son into the world, so that through him we might have life. 1 John 4:20-21 : If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if a person does not love his brother, whom he has seen, then he cannot love God, whom he has not seen. Yes, this is the command we have from him: whoever loves God must love his brother too. Some of the Scriptures that support this Mitzvah require that we love our Israelite (Jewish) brothers, some our brothers in the faith, some our neighbors, some strangers ( gerim ), some our enemies, and some people in general. No matter. Yeshua directs us to maintain an attitude of love toward all and, in this world of modern communication and modes of travel, our neighbor may be half-a-world away. In Luke 10:29 , a Torah scholar, seeking
    to justify withholding love, asked Yeshua: And who is my neighbor? Yeshua side-stepped answering him directly and, instead, told a story and then turned the question back to the scholar by asking him which of three persons in the story qualified as a neighbor? When the scholar answered that it was the one who showed another mercy, Yeshua neither affirmed nor disaffirmed his answer, but merely said to him in Luke 10:37 : You go and do as he did. Yeshua''s answer and the Scriptures that support this Mitzvah lead us to understand that we are to love ("as ourselves") every human being with whom we relate. That means that we are to desire for each person, that which we would want for ourselves, were we them. In truth, obeying this Mitzvah (especially as it applies to enemies) requires great faith and dying to self, which is the mark of a mature and discipled person. To be sure, the acts of love we show toward a peaceful neighbor are not expected to be the same as those we show toward an enemy
    who is intent on killing us. So, for example, we may personally visit our hungry neighbor with a gift of food but, if our enemy''s heart is dark and he wants to do us harm, perhaps the most loving thing we can do for him is to make sure that he cannot find us. That is not an attempt at humor. If our enemy is able to find and harms us, it will be counted against him as sin, and we should not want that for him. An example from the Bible of this, is David hiding from Saul who was intent on killing him ( 1 Samuel 19-24 ). As a side matter, I should say a few words about Proverbs 25:21-22 ''s, and Romans 12:19-20 ''s use of the expression " you will heap fiery coals on his head. " 1 Why would God approve of such a seemingly harmful act that appears to be the antithesis of loving our neighbor? Historians inform us that, in ancient times, the expression was understood as a blessing and not a cursing. Fires were difficult to start so, when possible, a person who wanted and needed to start a
    fire for his warmth or food would ask his neighbor for one or two glowing hot coals from his already-thriving fire. The fiery coals were customarily carried to their new location in a container placed on one''s head and protected by an insulating mat. Heaping fiery coals on our neighbor''s head rather than giving him just one or two coals was, therefore, considered a generous favor. 1. The CJB translation renders the expression: " you will heap fiery coals [of shame] on his head. " I see no justification for inserting " [of shame] " and have omitted it. I suppose the translator''s logic is that if you bless your neighbor who hates you, he will feel shame for his hate and repent.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat loving neighbors, gerim , and enemies as separate mitzvot , and draw distinctions between neighbors who are Jews and those who are not. Also, the term ger refers to non-Jewish foreigners who have come to live within the cities of Israel (within Jewish communities), but it more certainly refers to proselytes who have converted to Judaism. The classical commentators' concepts of "love", as expressed in their respective mitzvot , are very similar to how "love" is defined in this Mitzvah .

  commandment: We are prohibited from kidnapping anyone for any reason.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: Kidnapping (abduction) is essentially stealing a person. Coveting a person such as a servant or another man's wife is a state of mind that precedes the act of stealing or kidnapping. The Scriptures speak for themselves regarding the wrongfulness of kidnapping Israelites and all others as well.
  classical_commentators: The mitzvot of Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch prohibit the kidnapping of Israelites only, and consider kidnapping to be stealing.
  commentary_juster: There is a special case of kidnapping - kidnapping for ransom - where it is not the person who is desired, but a reward for the return of the person. The reward sought might be monetary or something else, such as the release of a prisoner. In addition, there is the kidnapping of children, again for reward, but also for people who simply want a child and take someone else's. This was the case in Solomon's famous decision of the woman who lost her own baby and wanted to steal the other's. Both of these are serious crimes and require serious penalties.

  commandment: We are to be hospitable to our neighbor.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Hospitality is often thought of as inviting people into our homes, feeding them, and giving them lodging. That is, of course, hospitality, but hospitality is broader than that - it is giving of oneself, often at a cost. It stands alongside of charity and generosity as being among the most important attributes of a believer because it requires that we put the needs of others before our own, and puts into practice the most important and overarching mitzvot , quoted by Yeshua in Matthew 22:37b-40 : ''You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.'' This is the greatest and most important mitzvah. And a second is similar to it, ''You are to love your neighbor as yourself.'' All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on these two mitzvot. Loving our neighbor (including our loved ones) involves self-sacrifice. Sometimes the sacrifice is miniscule and sometimes it is very great. However, the willingness and even
    desire to do it is the very nature of God Himself. The number of Scriptures I have found to cite is a testimony of how important God considers hospitality.'
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the classical commentators. Components of it are addressed, however, such as having love for God and eighbor, giving tzedakah , and otherwise walking in God's ways.

  commandment: We are not to judge our neighbor wrongfully, nor fail to judge him rightfully.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: '"Judging" is forming an opinion based on evidence or perceived evidence. There are two basic kinds of judgment: (1) temporal and (2) eternal, and there are three authorities for passing judgment: (1) God, (2) mankind, and (3) institutional. Temporal judgment is of the here and now, whereas eternal judgment has to do with one''s life with God in the world to come. The authorities for eternal judgment are (first and foremost) God, but also batei din (ecclesiastical courts) in which the body of believers renders judgments that could have eternal consequences: Matthew 18:15-19 : Moreover, if your brother commits a sin against you, go and show him his fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother. If he doesn''t listen, take one or two others with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to hear them, tell the congregation; and if he refuses to listen
    even to the congregation, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector. Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven. To repeat, I tell you that if two of you here on earth agree about anything people ask, it will be for them from my Father in heaven. Temporal judgments are of two levels. The first is "merely forming an opinion", and the second is "making a finding"; they may appear the same but they are not. The first of these, forming an opinion, may lead to making a personal decision such as whether to trust a person or be in a person''s company, but it is not, by definition, conveyed to another person lest it constitute gossip. Proverbs 20:19 : A gossip goes around revealing secrets, so don''t get involved with a talkative person. 2 Corinthians 12:20 : For I am afraid of coming and finding you not the way I want you to be, and also of not being found the way you want me to
    be. I am afraid of finding quarreling and jealousy, anger and rivalry, slander and gossip, arrogance and disorder. The second level of judging (making a finding), is intended to influence others and, if done rightly and officially (e.g. by a bet din ), the finding is binding on others such as when a court finds a party guilty or innocent of violating a law. There is a difference between judging "rightly", "rightfully", and "righteously" (the opposite is judging wrongly, wrongfully, and un-righteously): judging "rightly" means making a correct decision, and judging "wrongly" means making a wrong decision. A person can be a proper person to judge and still make a wrong decision. A similar term, judging "rightfully" (the opposite is "wrongfully") has nothing to do with whether a judgment rendered is right or wrong; it has to do with whether the person judging is a proper person to do it (in legal terms, "has jurisdiction"). An example would be a person that witnesses a murder and, without
    authority, convenes a trial, judges, and convicts the murderer. The judgment is right because the convicted person did, in fact, commit the crime. However, the person judging the murderer has not judged rightly because he or she did not have authority to convene the trial and appoint him or herself to be the judge. Scripture requires that even when a person judges rightly and rightfully, he or she must also judge righteously. That is, the person doing the judging must not be in a state of unrepentant sin while judging another. Scripture says that if you are yourself guilty of that which you judge another, you are a hypocrite and pass judgment upon yourself. It is important to understand that, not only are there certain kinds of judgments we should not make, but there are certain kinds that are required of us. One that is often overlooked is Galatians 6:1 : Brothers, suppose someone is caught doing something wrong. You who have the Spirit should set him right, but in a spirit of humility,
    keeping an eye on yourselves so that you won''t be tempted too. And also 1 Corinthians 5:12b : Isn''t it those who are part of the [believing] community that you should be judging? In order to be able to correct a fellow believer (or a family member), we must first determine that he or she is doing something wrong, and that constitutes making a judgment. It is not uncommon for those we seek to properly correct to rebuff our correction by quoting Matthew 7:1 which, in the "King James Version", reads: Judge not, that ye be not judged. As impressive as it sounds in the old English vernacular, it is an incorrect application of the Scripture if it is spoken in order to avoid the correction. The Scripture does not mean that it is improper for believers or family members to correct one another. It warns a person who corrects another that he or she is held to the same standard of righteousness with which he or she is judging. This is made clear if we read further to verse five: Matthew 7:1-5
    Don''t judge, so that you won''t be judged. For the way you judge others is how you will be judged - the measure with which you measure out will be used to measure to you. Why do you see the splinter in your brother''s eye but not notice the log in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ''Let me take the splinter out of your eye,'' when you have the log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye; then you will see clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother''s eye! (CJB) Very wise advice!'
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the classical commentators. Most of what they have to say about judging is related to justice in batei din and are dealt with elsewhere in this volume.
  commentary_juster: The use of the Matthew 7:1 phrase " Judge not, that ye be not judged. " (KJV) has probably become the most popular biblical verse for people who do not want to be accountable for their behavior, and teach that no one should evaluate or judge them in any way. This is so obviously wrong and foolish. We have to make judgments all the time. Should we trust the vacuum salesman, the insurance man, the investment counselor and others? The Bible says to have nothing to do with people who claim to be believers who engage in certain sinful practices. In 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 , the Apostle Paul instructs the Corinthians to judge a particular man who is living in sin and remove him from the fellowship. Also, Matthew 18:15-17 shows how judgment comes about. So what was Yeshua speaking about in Matthew 7:1 ? Hypocrisy and not having a judgmental or censorious spirit.

  commandment: We are to repent of our own sin before seeking to correct our neighbor.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The term "hypocrite" is often applied to persons who seek to correct others while being in significant fault themselves. According to Galatians 6:1 , it is right for us to correct a brother who is caught doing something sinful, provided that we do so " in a spirit of humility, keeping an eye on [ourselves] so that [we] won''t be tempted too. " A key aspect of humility is our willingness to judge our own conduct against what is taught in Scripture, and especially before seeking to correct our neighbor''s. Notice that I said "correct" and not "judge" when our neighbor is not a brother or sister believer. Passing judgment is authoritative, and goes further than merely seeking to correct. According to 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 , believers are authorized to judge one other, but are not to judge those outside the body of believers: For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Isn''t it those who are part of the community that you should be judging? God will judge those
    who are outside. Just expel the evildoer from among yourselves.'

  commandment: We are to serve our neighbor, seeking not to be served.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Serving our neighbor is meeting his needs in the way that we would want him to meet our needs ( Matthew 7:12 ), were our situations reversed. The reason that servanthood is critically important is that it comprises specific ways to love our neighbor that is never without cost or sacrifice to ourselves. When we help our neighbor build because he needs shelter, we give of our time that we could otherwise spend on our own needs or pleasures. When we give our neighbor food (or money) because he is hungry, we give him a valuable resource that we could otherwise consume or spend on ourselves. I am reminded of James 2:15-16 : Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food, and someone says to him, ''Shalom! Keep warm and eat hearty!'' without giving him what he needs, what good does it do? The two examples above are of physical helps, but servanthood often involves giving of ourselves in less tangible ways as well, such as correcting, counseling, and praying
    for our neighbor.'

  commandment: We are to pursue peace with our neighbor.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Hebrew word for "peace" is " shalom ," and the Greek word is " ireinei ." Ireinei connotes harmony and tranquility, while shalom includes that, but also connotes completeness and soundness. Neither of the words is limited to the absence of turmoil and strife. "Peace" is an attribute of God with which He desires to bless us, for we read in Philippians 4:7 : Then God''s shalom, passing all understanding, will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with the Messiah Yeshua. God created us in His image and, as with so many of God''s attributes, He desires that, over time, we develop to become more like Him. A first step in emulating God in His attribute of peace is to acquire it from Him. The next step is to live in peace with our neighbor, and the ultimate step is to actively pursue peace and become a peacemaker. Considering the expanded definition of "peace" in the Hebrew and Greek, being a peacemaker is more than mediating conflicts (although it is a part). Being
    a peacemaker, from a Biblical perspective, involves caring for our neighbor in such a way as to enhance his completeness, his tranquility, and his safety.'

  commandment: We are not to hold onto anger toward our neighbor.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Psalm 4:4(3) says: " You can be angry, but do not sin! ", and similarly, Ephesians 4:26 says: " Be angry, but don''t sin. " Clearly, anger itself is not sinful, but what we do as a result of our anger often is, and that is why there are so many Scriptures that warn us against anger. Notice that both of the Scriptures above command us to not sin as a result of our anger - a comforting reminder that we can control our anger, and not sin on account of it. Anger can be directed toward a circumstance or even against our self, but this Mitzvah has to do with anger directed against a person (our neighbor), that we allow to persist. That, Matthew 5:22 says is sin, and Ephesians 4:26-27 says that we must not let the sun go down on our anger which means that in order to avoid sin, any anger we have toward our neighbor must be short-lived.'
  classical_commentators: Leviticus 19:18 cited above is the basis for Maimonides', Meir's and HaChinuch's mitzvot on loving, and on not taking vengeance or bearing a grudge. While they could be related to holding onto anger (the subject of this Mitzvah ), holding onto anger is not necessarily involved.

  commentary_rudolph: 'The natural un-regenerated man elevates himself and therefore despises his neighbors who are not like he is. We sometimes justify despising a person because he is our enemy or because of his sin.

Rebuke some who are disputing; save others, snatching them out of the fire; and to yet others, show mercy, but with fear, hating even the clothes stained by their vices.'

  commandment: We are to be compassionate and merciful toward our neighbor.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Mercy and compassion are often referred to in the same Scripture, and the various translations of the Bible sometimes do not agree on which of the words should be used in a given verse. Although they are related to loving our neighbor, mercy and compassion are not the same. Compassion is an empathetic identification with a person''s trial or difficulty, whereas mercy is an action (or intentional inaction) of withholding harm from a person that one is empowered to impart. It is ideal when mercy is driven by compassion, but it is sometimes driven by other motivators as well, such as duty and considerations of practicality. Sympathy is also referred to in Scripture, but it is different in that it is more of a cognitive recognition of a person''s difficulty, that is not necessarily accompanied by an emotional response. Mercy and compassion are attributes of God, that God wants to be our attributes as well. The reason that God can require them of us is that they are part
    of creation - part of His having created us in His image. Whereas, compassion comes upon us automatically, whether or not we extend mercy requires that we decide based upon circumstances, and there are times (e.g. when justice requires punishment) when it is right to withhold mercy even while feeling compassion. The Scriptures presented herein are clear that it is God''s will that we have an attitude of mercy toward our neighbor, the reason being that God is merciful toward us. Indeed, mercy is an attribute of God, for we read in Exodus 34:6-7: ADONAI passed before him and proclaimed: "YUD-HEH-VAV-HEH!!! Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [[ADONAI]] is God, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in grace and truth; showing grace to the thousandth generation, forgiving offenses, crimes and sins; yet not exonerating the guilty, but causing the negative effects of the parents'' offenses to be experienced by their children and grandchildren, and even by the third and fourth generations. This is known
    within Judaism as the "Thirteen Attributes of Mercy" or " Shelosh-''Esreh Middot HaRakhamim ."'

  commandment: We are not to wrong one another through our speech.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'There is a children''s rhyme: "Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never harm me." It is taught to children as a lesson that they should not retaliate against name-calling, but the weight of Scripture teaches that the rhyme is not true. Indeed, without interfering with its intended lesson, the rhyme should rather state: "Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can hurt me deeply." The greater lesson of the substitute rhyme and of Scripture is that we must guard our tongue to ensure its use for good and holiness, and not for harm. There is a rabbinical halachah against lashon hara , (negative speech) - literally "evil or bad tongue" - that is inspired by Leviticus 19:16 (see also, Ephesians 4:29 and James 4:11 ). The halachah prohibits speaking negatively about a person, regardless of the truth of what is said, and it also prohibits listening to or believing such negative statements. It is regrettable that a number of English translations of Leviticus
    19:16 render the Hebrew noun " rachiyl " as "slander" because the English word "slander" connotes both negativity and untruthfulness. " Rachiyl ", on the other hand, connotes negativity, but not necessarily untruthfulness, so a better translation of " rachiyl " is "negative report". Speaking negatively about a person invariably harms him in some way, and bringing harm to a person (except when sanctioned legally) is always wrong. It is egregious to God, and especially so if the lashon hara is against a leader that God Himself has set in office. That which happened to Miryam when she murmured against Moses is the quintessential example of how serious a sin it is; we read about it in Numbers 12:1-2 and 6-10 : Miryam and Aharon began criticizing Moshe on account of the Ethiopian woman he had married, for he had in fact married an Ethiopian woman. They said, "Is it true that ADONAI has spoken only with Moshe? Hasn''t he spoken with us too?" ADONAI heard them. He said, "Listen to what I say:
    when there is a prophet among you, I, ADONAI, make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. But it isn''t that way with my servant Moshe. He is the only one who is faithful in my entire household. With him I speak face to face and clearly, not in riddles; he sees the image of ADONAI. So why weren''t you afraid to criticize my servant Moshe?" The anger of ADONAI flared up against them, and he left. But when the cloud was removed from above the tent, Miryam had tzara''at, [leprosy] as white as snow. Aharon looked at Miryam, and she was as white as snow. Miryam and Aaron speaking against Moses and the grumbling referred to in James 5:9 are similar. Matthew 5 and Matthew 18 are relevant to the subject of wrongful speech because speech so often causes (or is the result of) human conflicts. Matthew 5 speaks to the offender, and Matthew 18 to the offended and, in both cases, the required initial action is to hold our tongue, not speak negatively about our brother to others,
    and go to the person with whom we have the conflict. It is only after there has been no success at reconciliation that others may become involved, and then, only in a controlled manner. The second and final attempts at reconciliation Matthew 18:16 & 17 are parts of an authorized judicial process that begins with mediation, and culminates in adjudication. Whatever is spoken before witnesses at these two "judicial" sessions is considered testimony, and is therefore exempt from the restrictions of lashon hara . Uttering a curse against a person or against God is speech that intends harm, is wrongful, and is prohibited.'
  classical_commentators: A number of the classical mitzvot aspire to control how we speak so as not to harm others, but the one closest to this Mitzvah is Maimonides' negative mitzvah RN301 (corresponding to MN77 and C236), that is based on Leviticus 19:16 , and which forbids us from bearing tales among our people. Maimonides' mitzvah RN301 also prohibits "defaming", which some rabbis and commentators believe means defaming the reputation of a bride (see RP219). Meir and HaChinuch have much more than Maimonides to say about Leviticus 19:16 and its relationship to lashon hara . First of all, they interpret the Scripture narrowly as meaning that a person must not tell another person that a third person has spoken negatively about him. Meir adds that gossiping with evil intent is criminally worse than merely tale-bearing, and that it has the effect of killing three people - the gossiper, the person who receives the gossip, and the person who is gossiped about. Neither Meir nor HaChinuch make
    mention of defaming a bride. Meir speaks of punishment for violating Leviticus 19:16 that will come from HaShem , but HaChinuch is more temporally severe, and speaks of it being our religious duty to end the life of person who threatens to inform on another, and under certain other circumstances as well. If such executions were ever authorized under the Mosaic Law, they were most certainly part of the Sinai Covenant's judicial processes. Under no circumstances are they authorized in the New Covenant under which we live today. One may wonder why this Mitzvah lists Leviticus 19:17 , a Scripture that speaks of rebuking our neighbor, but that does mention anyone being wronged or harmed. It is because Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret and quote that Scripture as the basis for their respective mitzvot RN303, MN77 and C240, which admonish us to not shame our neighbor by rebuking him in public. Another wrongful use of speech, recognized by the commentators, is cursing. Maimonides, Meir,
    and HaChinuch constructed mitzvot that prohibit the cursing of parents, judges, and Israelites, and Maimonides and HaChinuch each wrote a mitzvah that prohibits the cursing of a ruler. Strangely, none of them mention cursing God, that is specifically prohibited by Exodus 22:27(28) , which all three quote to support their mitzvot . Leviticus 19:33 is listed because it is referenced by Maimonides and HaChinuch in their RN252 and C63 (respectively), both of which assume that the wrong alluded to in the Scripture is wrongful speech.

  commandment: We are to help our neighbor who is in need.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is a natural consequence of the Mitzvah "Loving Our Neighbor, the Stranger, and Even Our Enemy." Scripture requires that we help our neighbor who is in need whether or not we are asked, and whether or not he is a friend. Scripture also commands that help be given even at a cost to ourselves, and therein lies the greatest challenge, which is, "How far must we go to help, and at how great a cost?" Do we give to our neighbor financially to the extent of impoverishing ourselves and our family? Do we rise from our battlefield trench to help our fallen enemy only to get shot ourselves? Throughout life, we encounter situations of these kinds, usually not as extreme, but similar in that helping our neighbor risks something, or takes something away from us with certainty. It may be money, it may be property, it may be time, and it may occasionally be life. There is no biblical formula for when to help, for how much to help, or for whom to help in a given circumstance.
    We must be tuned into and rely on the Holy Spirit to guide us.
  classical_commentators: 'There are some differences among Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch regarding one''s obligation to unload and reload an animal that belongs to a Jew and that has fallen as a result of its burden. All agree that both unloading and reloading are obligations but in regard to unloading, Meir states that an elder is exempt because it is beneath the dignity of his status as an elder. HaChinuch agrees with the elder exemption in general, but states that the elder is not exempt if he would have unloaded his own animal under similar circumstances. HaChinuch also states (but Meir does not) that if one encounters a friend and a non-friend with a fallen animal at precisely the same time, one must first assist the non-friend in unloading in order to avoid impure intent. Strangely, in regard to the loading of a fallen animal, Meir and HaChinuch state these obligations somewhat in reverse. Meir states that an elder is exempt from loading and reloading unless he would have done similarly
    for himself, and he states that one must help a non-friend before a friend. HaChinuch, on the other hand, makes no mention of friends, non-friends, and elders being exempt in the case of loading, whereas Maimonides does not allude to these secondary matters at all. Of significance is that, in the New Covenant Scriptures, Matthew 23:11 and 20:26-27 , Yeshua speaks against Meir''s and HaChinuch''s interpretation that the dignity of an elder causes him to be exempt from helping his neighbor with the neighbor''s fallen animal. In fact, Yeshua teaches the opposite when He says: " The greatest among you must be your servant " and " Whoever among you wants to be a leader must become your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave!

  commandment: We are to unconditionally forgive all who sin against us, and conditionally forgive those who repent.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Forgiveness in Jewish Tradition While there is no explicit commandment in the Torah requiring that we forgive our brother, there is one Scripture, Leviticus 19:17 , that implicitly means the same thing: Do not hate your brother in your heart, but rebuke your neighbor frankly, so that you won''t carry sin because of him. Don''t take vengeance on or bear a grudge against any of your people; rather, love your neighbor as yourself; I am ADONAI. Rabbinical literature endorses the principle of forgiving others, and gives Genesis 50:16-21 (Yosef''s forgiveness of his brothers) as the example we are to follow. Beyond that, all other references to forgiveness are rabbinic, and include: Mishnah : Yoma 8:9; Baba Kama (92a) 8:5 Talmud : Yoma 86b; Rosh HaShana 17a; Ta''anith 20a,b; Beitz 32b; Shabbat 151b Shulchan Aruch : Yom Kippur 606:1 Mishneh Torah : De''ot 6:6,9; Madda 6:6,9; Teshuvah 2:9,10,11; 43 It is clear, however, from the following New Covenant Scriptures, that there
    are not one, but two kinds of forgiveness - unconditional and conditional - and our responsibility to forgive others is different for each of them. Unconditional Forgiveness 2 I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in Mark 11:25 3 " unconditional Forgiveness ": And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses. Notice that this kind of forgiveness is truly without condition, and is to be granted, not only to brothers in the Lord, but to anyone who has sinned against us and hurt us. It does not seek to judge the offender, nor does it require that the offender be repentant. It must be given as soon as possible after the offense is committed, so that bitterness does not take root within us and do spiritual damage. This kind of forgiveness is essentially a releasing of the matter to God, and does not retain anger or a desire for personal vengeance (see Ephesians 4:31-32 ). Unconditional forgiveness
    is a manifestation of godly love that we are to give, even to our enemies ( Luke 6:27-32 ). Yeshua illustrated this kind of forgiveness when, in Luke 23:34a , He beseeched His Father in heaven to forgive His Roman soldier executioners who were, even at that moment, subjecting Him to an unjust and painful death. Our granting unconditional forgiveness, and not harboring bitterness against those who have sinned against us, purges us of unholy attitudes that may have resulted from our being victimized, and opens the way for God to forgive us for our sins as well. Conversely, if we do not grant unconditional forgiveness, Mark 11:25 4 , Matthew 6:14-15 , and Luke 6:37 convey the certainty that God will not forgive us either. Granting unconditional forgiveness does not, however, mean that the relationship or trust between persons is restored. It only means that the person who has forgiven has freed himself from the anger of vengeance, and has a heart to see the person who has sinned against
    him repent so that he might be blessed by God. Conditional Forgiveness I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in Luke 17:3-4 " Conditional Forgiveness ". 5 Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times he comes to you and says, ''I repent,'' you are to forgive him. Conditional forgiveness is different from unconditional forgiveness in several ways that the Luke Scripture illustrates. First, conditional forgiveness applies only to brother believers. 6 Second, whereas unconditional forgiveness must be given whether or not there is repentance, conditional forgiveness is only granted if the offending brother repents, and the brother who has been sinned against is required to judge whether the offending brother has repented before the offended brother forgives him. And it is different in another way as well, which is illustrated in John 20:23 which states: If you forgive someone''s
    sins, their sins are forgiven; if you hold them, they are held. Here you see that if one who is sinned-against, judges that his offending brother is repentant and forgives him, God also forgives the offending brother. Conversely, if one who is sinned against withholds forgiveness because, in his judgment, his brother is not repentant, then God honors the judgment and does not forgive the offending brother either. One may ask why John 20:23 applies only as between believers since the Scripture doesn''t say that! It is because the verse involves judging, and 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 allows us to judge those who are within the body of believers, but not those who are outside. Forgiveness Has No Limits There is no maximum number of times that we must forgive those who sin against us, even if they do so repeatedly. There are no limits on our granting unconditional or conditional forgiveness so that we might walk in holy attitudes and continuous forgiveness ourselves. As previously stated in
    Luke 17:4 : Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times he comes to you and says, ''I repent,'' you are to forgive him. And similarly in Matthew 18:21-22 : Then Kefa came up and said to him, "Rabbi, how often can my brother sin against me and I have to forgive him? As many as seven times?" "No, not seven times," answered Yeshua, "but seventy times seven!" Scripture''s requirement that we forgive does not negate our responsibility to cooperate with public authorities when matters of justice or the protection of others is involved. 2. Sometimes termed "Personal Forgiveness" 3. In other translations, verses 25-26 4. Ibid. 5. It has sometimes been referred to as "Transactional Forgiveness". 6. Understand that everything said about a brother believer applies to a sister as well.'
  classical_commentators: There are no mitzvot by Maimonides, Meir, or HaChinuch on the subject of forgiveness.

  commandment: We are to bring correction to one another, to resolve disputes and to seek reconciliation with brothers who have sinned against us, and to repent and to seek reconciliation if we have sinned against our brother. Likewise, our elder leaders are to rebuke, correct and bring discipline to those within our congregational communities that require it.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Different corrective considerations apply according to whether a brother''s sin is against another brother (private offense) or against the community broadly (public offense). Also, that which applies to a brother does not necessarily apply to unbelieving neighbors because unbelievers have not committed themselves to the principles and disciplines of Scripture ( 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 ). A. RESPONDING TO THE PRIVATE OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER A. RESPONDING TO THE PRIVATE OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER OVERLOOKING A SIN Even when we are authorized to seek redress for a sin committed against us, we need not do so, for Proverbs 19:11 states: People with good sense are slow to anger, and it is their glory to overlook an offense. And Ecclesiastes 7:21-22 states: Also, don''t take seriously every word spoken, such as when you hear your servant speaking badly of you; because often, as you yourself know, you have spoken badly of others. This is in keeping with God''s desire
    that we take upon ourselves His holy nature, for He Himself has been known to overlook sin ( Acts 17:29-30 ). 1 Some private offenses are easily overlooked - especially those that are unintentional, have done no great harm, and are unlikely to be repeated. Although it may seem that overlooking an offense is always the loving thing to do, it is not necessarily so. One''s decision should always be based upon what is best for the offender, and what is best for others against whom the offender may sin in the future if he is not made accountable. If the offense is overlooked, it should not be brought up again unless the offense is repeated. Also, overlooking a sin does not assure that the parties will remain in, or return to, reconciliation. 1. Consider also, how Moses pleaded with God to overlook the sins of Israel ( Deuteronomy 9:27 ). GOING TO OUR OFFENDING BROTHER Much is said about rebuking and correcting in both the Tanach and the New Covenant Scriptures. Leviticus 19:17-18 is generally
    cited by the classical Jewish commentators as the Scripture that commands this, but there are many others that apply as well, as one can see from the large number of Scriptures cited in this Mitzvah . Another key Scripture from the Tanach is Proverbs 27:5 : Better open rebuke than hidden love. (See also, Proverbs 9:8-9 ) If our decision is to not overlook an offense, we must confront the offending brother with his sin: Matthew 18:15 : Moreover, if your brother commits a sin against you, go and show him his fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother. Galatians 6:1-2 : Brothers, suppose someone is caught doing something wrong. You who have the Spirit should set him right, but in a spirit of humility, keeping an eye on yourselves so that you won''t be tempted too. Bear one another''s burdens - in this way you will be fulfilling the Torah''s true meaning, which the Messiah upholds. There are three things in the foregoing Scriptures
    that stand out. First, we are to go to our brother alone. That means we are not to share our complaint with others before first giving our brother the opportunity to repent and make things right. This principle assumes two things: (1) The parties are relatively equal in their ability to deal with one another, and (2) There is no impropriety in the parties meeting privately. An example of inequality would be a child having to confront an adult; an example of improper privacy would be a male and female meeting alone to confront one another concerning sexual sin. In these and similar cases, the Scriptures should be interpreted broadly enough to permit chaperoning and for allowing the weaker of the two adversaries to be accompanied by a suitable protector. Second, when we go to our brother to tell him his fault, our attitude must be pure, and our demeanor proper. The operative expression in the Galatians Scripture is " a spirit of humility ", and our motive for going must be to reconcile
    and not to extract a confession of fault. Third, our purpose for confronting our brother must be to restore him to righteousness, and our hope must be for reconciliation. Although in cases involving damage or loss we may seek restitution as part of the reconciliation process, we are not to sue our brother in a secular court ( 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 ). RETURNING WITH WITNESSES If the offending brother agrees with our complaint and repents, the matter is, of course, concluded, and we forgive him. If he does not agree or refuses to meet privately, we must then elect whether to pursue the matter further, or to belatedly overlook his sin ( Proverbs 19:11 ). Although overlooking the sin at this juncture is possible, its appropriateness has to be questioned. If there remains un-reconciliation, we should go to our brother again and, this time, bring one or two witnesses: Matthew 18:16 : If he doesn''t listen, take one or two others with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony
    of two or three witnesses. These need not be witnesses to the original offense complained of (although they may be), but rather to our second meeting with our brother. 2 Our usual concept of witnesses is that they are silent observers. In this case, however, Matthew 18:17 , authorizes the witnesses to determine which of the parties to the dispute is wrong, and to urge that person to listen to reason and repent: Matthew 18:17a : If he refuses to hear them ... As before, if the parties come to agreement or the offending brother repents, the matter is concluded. If however, the attempt at reconciliation is unsuccessful, the matter must be brought to the ekklesia (assembly) for adjudication (see Matthew 18:17c below). 2. Although not addressed in Scripture, fairness probably allows the offending brother to invite his own witnesses to the meeting as well. BRINGING THE DISPUTE TO A BET DIN OF ELDERS Matthew 18:17b : ... tell the congregation The word "congregation" in the CJB translation ("church"
    in some translations) is ( ekklesia ) in the Greek text, which means "a gathering", "an assembly" (for worship), or "a deliberative council". According to Matthew 18:17b , if the complainant and the witnesses are unsuccessful in convincing the offender to repent, the matter is to be brought to the ekklesia for adjudication. Since the entire ekklesia (the body of believers) is too large a group to assemble for hearing and judging cases, it is the prevailing view that a court ( bet din ) of assembled elders (reminiscent of Deuteronomy 17:8-13 ) acts on behalf of the ekklesia . JUDGMENT OF THE ELDERS After the elders of a bet din render their judgment, the party ruled against is required to repent and comply with any orders issued, including orders of restitution. If he refuses to do so, he commits a new offense - that of disobeying the lawful orders of the tribunal. This new offense is public in nature because the disobedience is against the public authority. 3 When this occurs, the judging
    elders are required to inform the body of believers of the respondent''s disobedience, and order that he henceforth be treated as one who is no longer a believer: Matthew 18:17c : ... and if he refuses to listen even to the congregation, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector. This is sometimes referred to as a decree of "disfellowship" or "excommunication". It is a common misunderstanding that when a brother is excommunicated pursuant to Matthew 18 , he must necessarily be ejected from the congregation. On the contrary, after a judgment of excommunication, unless he is also disruptive, the "former" brother should be treated as an unbeliever in every way and we do not eject unbelievers. Instead, unless he is also a violator of 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 (walking in immorality while calling himself a believer) or Titus 3:10-11 (being divisive or otherwise harmful to the body), he should be encouraged to attend congregational services and other events where he is likely to hear the
    Word of God and be encouraged to repent. One important consequence of a Matthew 18 excommunication is that the complainant is released from the constraint of 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 and is free to sue the unrepentant respondent in a public court. Another common misunderstanding is that a decree of excommunication applies only to the excommunicating congregation or denomination. Biblically, that is not so. Judgments arising from Matthew 18 proceedings apply across the entire body of believers and, so long as correct biblical doctrine is applied and due process is afforded, all Yeshua-believing congregations should recognize and comply with judgments rendered by reputable batei din . What is especially ominous, is that God Himself recognizes batei din judgments ( Matthew 18:18-20 ). Unfortunately, the current state of the body of believers is such that a valid excommunication by one congregation''s or church''s ecclesiastic court is often ignored by other congregations, the result of which
    is that excommunicated persons are often received into a believing community without being required to repent. The body of believer needs to correct this. It is important to appreciate that a brother who is accused of sin cannot be forced to attend or to cooperate with any of the Matthew 18 meetings. However, if he refuses to meet or to attend, he does so at his peril, because his refusal elevates the controversy to its next level without anyone being able to hear his defense or point of view. If he refuses to attend or cooperate at the last ( bet din ) stage, evidence against him will likely be presented in his absence, with predictable results. 3. See section below: "Responding to a Public Offense." RESTORING A BROTHER TO FELLOWSHIP A judgment of "disfellowship" is reversible in the same way as the status of being an unbeliever is reversible. What is required is that the sanctioned brother repent of his former sin, comply with all orders of the convicting bet din , and receive Yeshua
    again as his Lord and Savior. Ideally, the same bet din that ruled previously is convened to judge the repentance and, if it is deemed genuine, the tribunal sets aside its prior judgment and publishes a decree of restoration. This restoration, which is declared on earth, is also recognized in heaven: Matthew 18:18-20: Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven. To repeat, I tell you that if two of you here on earth agree about anything people ask, it will be for them from my Father in heaven. For wherever two or three are assembled in my name, I am there with them. THE "JUDGE-ME-NOT" DEFENSE Believers who seek to avoid correction often quote Matthew 7:1 : Don''t judge, so that you won''t be judged. The full context of this Scripture is, however, rarely quoted; it continues with verses 2-5 : For the way you judge others is how you will be judged - the measure with which you measure
    out will be used to measure to you. Why do you see the splinter in your brother''s eye but not notice the log in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ''Let me take the splinter out of your eye,'' when you have the log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye; then you will see clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother''s eye! So, the Scripture does not prohibit judging one''s brother; it merely exhorts us to repent of our own sins first. There is, in addition, another Scripture, 1 Corinthians 5:12 , that specifically authorizes brothers to judge each other; it reads: For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Isn''t it those who are part of the community that you should be judging? WHEN THE OFFENDER IS US! Matthew 5:23-24 : So if you are offering your gift at the Temple altar and you remember there that your brother has something against you, leave your gift where it is by the altar, and go, make peace with your brother.
    Then come back and offer your gift. If we know or suspect that we have sinned against a brother, we are not to wait until the brother comes to us - we are to go to him. Noted author Jay Adams has been known to say that ideally, the offender and the offended should meet in the street between their respective homes, each on his way to seek reconciliation with the other. B. RESPONDING TO A PUBLIC OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER B. RESPONDING TO A PUBLIC OFFENSE COMMITTED BY A BROTHER A public offense is a sin committed by an individual against the community broadly, i.e., against the local congregation, or believers at large. This kind of offense is the biblical analogy of a criminal offense in secular law. Public offenses pose a danger to the community, so the primary responsibility of the community''s leaders is to protect the flock by ministering correction to the offender. The goal here is different than in the case of private offenses, where promoting reconcilÂ­iation through the Matthew
    18 process is the primary purpose. The following verses of Scripture reveal how the shaliach Paul dealt with one such public offense: 1 Corinthians 5:1-2 : It is actually being reported that there is sexual sin among you, and it is sexual sin of a kind that is condemned even by pagans - a man is living with his stepmother! And you stay proud? Shouldn''t you rather have felt some sadness that would have led you to remove from your company the man who has done this thing? 1 Corinthians 5:5 : ... hand over such a person to the Adversary for his old nature to be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord. PROSECUTING PUBLIC OFFENSES An important difference between public and private offenses is that, in the case of public offenses, it is the community''s guardians - its elders - who are responsible for protecting the community by correcting wrongs, and administering justice ( Hebrews 13:17 ). That notwithstanding, an individual congregant is often the first person
    to become aware that a public offense has or may have been committed. Although, according to Galatians 6:1-2 he may confront the perpetrator for the purpose of ministering correction and urging his brother to repent, he is not authorized to act for the community in either judging the matter or deciding what remedial action should be taken. Therefore, in all but trivial cases, the congregant-citizen''s duty is to report the suspected offense, or the evidence thereof, to the community''s elders 4 . 5 In my opinion, the procedure of choice for prosecuting public offenses should, where possible, be a modification of the Matthew 18 process previously discussed. In the case of public offenses, however, the complainant is not an individual; rather, it is the community, so the ones to confront are one or more elders representing the community, analogous to Matthew 18:15 . If the initial confrontation does not produce an adequate result, the next step is to meet again, this time taking one or
    two additional witnesses (who should also be elders, analogous to Matthew 18:16 ). If, after this meeting, the elder delegation believes that the accused has committed sin and the matter is not resolved, then, just as in the case of a private offense, a formal bet din of the ekklesia is convened. This conclave consists of the elders who were the witnesses, preferably joined by other elders, analogous to Matthew 18:17 . Then, after hearing, if the bet din rules against the accused, it is to take whatever measures it deems appropriate for enabling justice and protecting the community. It is also my opinion, when an individual has reason to believe that a brother in the faith has committed a significant trespass against the criminal law of society, a prudent and covenantal first step is to consult elders of the body for their wisdom in how to proceed. Nevertheless, the individual may inform the secular governing authorities directly but, if he does, his reason for doing so should be that
    it is required for public safety, and to comply with Romans 13:1-2 . 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 does not apply in this case, because that Scripture only prohibits brothers suing brothers for redress of private grievances; this would not be a private grievance. 4. A gentle covenantal approach to doing this is to urge the offender to go to the elders himself and confess his transgression. If he is unwilling to do so, he should be invited to be present when the informant discloses to the elders. 5. According to Deuteronomy 19:15 , one may not bring an accusation, except by the testimony of two or three witnesses. This does not preclude one from informing the elders that an offense may have been committed; it does, however, define the level of proof needed for verdict of "guilty". PUNISHING FOR PUBLIC OFFENSES The only proper response for having committed a public offense is to repent and obey all remedial orders issued by a properly constituted bet din . Although there are a myriad of possible
    public offenses, there are two categories of them which, if not repented of, result in separation from the body of believers; the two categories are: (a) sins that can lead to excommunication (b) sins that can lead to being removed from fellowship. The first of these categories (a) has already been discussed: It is refusing to repent for a sin after being ordered to do so by a bet din in the aftermath of a judicial proceeding. As previously explained, excommunication is a judgment by a court of elders that a person, once considered to be a brother in the faith, is no longer so. It is important to mention here that excommunication does not result from the underlying sin itself, but from the disobedience of refusing to repent after being ordered to do so. The second of these categories (b) consists of five behaviors for which a person must be banned from fellowship with believers: A believer, who is walking in unrepentant immorality ( 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 ). A believer, who is in gross
    doctrinal error, and not in accord with the Scripture and with Apostolic doctrine ( 2 John 1:9-11 , Galatians 1:8-9 ). A believer who is disorderly in his lifestyle ( 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15 ): A believer who is divisive and has been warned twice ( Titus 3:10-11 ; Romans 16:17 ). An unbeliever who is rebellious and scoffs at the Word of God ( Proverbs 22:10 ). In the first three cases, the danger to the body comes from the offender holding himself out, or being considered to be, part of the community - a believer, yet being in significant sin, professing heretical doctrines, or walking in a disorderly manner. While these traits are understandable in unbelievers, a believer (or professing believer) with such characteristics brings discredit to the body. Such behaviors can also present a stumbling block for new members of a believing community who are not yet fully discipled, and whose discernment is not yet fully developed. The fourth and fifth cases on the list apply to persons who sow
    discord, whether or not they are believers, and it makes no difference that the rebelliousness or divisiveness is unconscious or unintended. They are both dangerous and contagious in a community of believers, and those who practice them and do not stop must be excluded. In the first four cases, repentance restores the offending brother to fellowship, and in the fifth case, the unbeliever to again being welcome. Restoration is not automatic, however, for whether or not an offender''s repentance is genuine is a matter to be judged by the same bet din that judged and disciplined him originally. ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ELDERS Some contend that Scripture establishes a more stringent standard for bringing an accusation against an elder and, for their authority, they refer to 1 Timothy 5:19-20 : Never listen to any accusation against a leader unless it is supported by two or three witnesses. Rebuke before the whole assembly those leaders who continue sinning, as a warning to the others. Actually,
    the foregoing Scripture establishes the same standard for bringing an accusation against an elder as does Deuteronomy 19:15 for bringing an accusation against anyone else. A plausible explanation for why there exists a special Scripture for elders, is that the verses which precede 1 Timothy 5:19 speak of the awesome responsibility which leaders have to their flock. The flock is therefore exhorted to obey their leaders so as to assist them in performing their functions with joy. Because leaders are highly visible and their actions sometimes controversial, they are especially vulnerable to accusations and criticisms in the form of whispers or gossip. These are damaging to an elder''s reputation and ability to lead, and so the above verses of Scripture are a reminder to us that we must apply to our elders the same high standard that we apply when we bring public accusations against others. C. REBUKING AND CORRECTING A BROTHER EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO OFFENSE COMMITTED AGAINST US C. REBUKING
    AND CORRECTING A BROTHER EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO OFFENSE COMMITTED AGAINST US Leviticus 19:17 : Do not hate your brother in your heart, but rebuke your neighbor frankly, so that you won''t carry sin because of him. This Scripture infers that we have a responsibility to rebuke and correct our neighbor brother who is in sin, even when the sin is not directed against us. It could be for our brother''s sake alone, and the Scripture is clear that, if we do not rebuke and correcthim, we will be in sin as well (see also, Galatians 6:1-2 ; James 5:16b ). D. BRINGING CORRECTION TO PERSONS OUTSIDE OF THE BELIEVING COMMUNITY D. BRINGING CORRECTION TO PERSONS OUTSIDE OF THE BELIEVING COMMUNITY In disputes with non-brethren, the believer is required to act biblically, while no such constraint can be expected from, or enforced upon, his opponent. Some may see this as a disadvantage for the believer, but it is actually a strength, because God''s peace and wisdom result from submitting one''s self to
    the Word of God. To begin with, the believer is not to exacerbate conflict by his own improper conduct. Rather, he is to live in peace with all persons as much as it is possible ( Romans 12:18 Proverbs 16:7 ) and, once conflict has arisen, he is not to respond in the flesh, but out of love ( Romans 12:19-21 ). As with conflicts between brethren, the exercise of personal forgiveness is mandatory: Mark 11:25 : And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses. Also, there are occasions when an offense may or should be overlooked, as stated in Proverbs 19:11 . If the offense is not overlooked, employing the first step in the Matthew 18 process (going to him privately) should be considered, even though it is not required in disputes with unbelievers, because Scripture teaches the advisability of settling disputes quickly ( Matthew 5:25 ). If going to your opponent does not solve the problem, suing in
    the public courts may be an option. Matthew 5:37-41 is often misunderstood as commanding believers to be pacifistic toward those who would hurt them, enslave them, or take their property. To understand this better, let us focus on verse 39a : But I tell you not to stand up against someone who does you wrong. The word "resist" in the Greek, " anth-is''-tay-mee " can refer to passive resistance, but one of its recognized meanings is "to set one''s self against" (Strong''s Greek Lexicon, word 436) - a decidedly aggressive posture. Which approach to employ when anthistaymee is used, can be deduced from the next sentence: On the contrary, if someone hits you on the right cheek, let him hit you on the left cheek too! According to Craig S. Keener, 6 " The blow on the right cheek was the most grievous insult possible in the ancient world ... " (e.g. 1 Kings 22:24 ). What the Scripture is actually saying (Keener opines), is that we should not retaliate against an evil person. For example, if
    the person tries to provoke us by insulting us, rather than meeting his challenge with aggression of our own, we should accept the insult and even a second insult (present our other cheek). This does not mean that we should not protect ourselves from harm either physically or through legal means when appropriate. The next statement in the Scripture, Matthew 5:40 , says: If someone wants to sue you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well. I agree with Keener that this is meant as hyperbole, and is addressing our attitude regarding ownership. It teaches that where someone is suing us unjustly, we should prefer to bear the injustice, and even give him more than he wants, rather than become a defendant in a law suit. The statement " And if a soldier forces you to carry his pack for one mile, carry it for two! " is also a teaching about our attitude regarding ownership - in this case, however, ownership of time and freedom. It is a reference to the ancient Roman soldier''s right to
    impress a person into serving him (e.g. Mark 15:21 ). The Scripture teaches that we should prefer to bear the injustice of servitude, and even give more than required as ones who, in obedience to God, are called to love our enemies. 6.

  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah contains elements that are not dealt with in the mitzvot of Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch. The only mitzvot in their respective compilations that touch on this Mitzvah (other than those that impose specific penalties for violations of law and deal with idolators and false prophets) are Maimonides' RP205, Meir's MP72, and HaChinuch's C239. Maimondes, Meir, and HaChinuch express their mitzvot as our being responsible for rebuking sinners without reference to whether or not the sin is directed against us. Maimonides includes those who are contemplating but have not yet committed sin, whereas Meir and HaChinuch do not touch on that. Another difference in the commentators is that HaChinuch states that one is prohibited from correcting a sinner if he believes that his correction will not be heeded. For his reason, he cites TB Yebamoth 65b , and expresses concern that the righteous admonisher will be disgraced by the sinner ignoring his rebuke. Also, HaChinuch
    states his mitzvah C239 in the context of an Israelite rebuking another Israelite. Maimonides and Meir speak of rebuking sinners more generally.

  commandment: We are not to exploit a neighbor's weakness to gain advantage, but are rather to help him to overcome.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: In ancient times, widows, orphans, and the poor were the principal disadvantaged classes, so when we read commandments related to them, it is fair to interpret them to include persons with other disadvantages and weaknesses brought about by circumstance. Scripture is clear that God is against anyone who exploits such persons or causes them harm. Indeed, they are to be protected and ministered to so that they may overcome their respective weaknesses or even be delivered from them. This is a proactive responsibility related to loving the stranger, our neighbor and even our enemy, helping our neighbor who is in need, and giving charity. It is not sufficient to merely do them no harm; it is required that we seek to improve their condition to the extent possible. Deuteronomy 24:14 makes it clear that we are not to exploit a poor and needy worker whether he is a brother or a stranger, and the examples of Yeshua and His disciples are that they did not distinguish between brothers
    and strangers in who they attempted to proactively help. As in the giving of charity, the Holy Spirit must be consulted to determine the level of help that is reasonable and required of us in each circumstance that comes to our attention. It is important to keep in mind that exploitation is not just benefitting from a person; it is deriving benefit from another unfairly by preying on his weakness. Not only does Scripture demand that we not do this, but it requires the opposite - that we seek to help disadvantaged persons and, to the extent that we are able, give them relief from their disability.
  classical_commentators: One can derive this Mitzvah by piecing together a number of the classical ones, but the single closest classical mitzvah is Maimonides' RN256 that prohibits our dealing harshly with widows and orphans. HaChinuch's C65 terms it "afflicting", and Meir's MN51 terms it "inflicting suffering". None of these deal explicitly with exploitation, and Deuteronomy 24:14 that does prohibit exploitation of the poor and needy worker is not referenced by any of the classical commentators.

  commandment: We are to take reasonable steps to keep ourselves and others safe in areas that are under our control.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is derived from Deuteronomy 22:8 , which teaches that one must build protective railings around the roofs of our houses, and from the more general commandment, Leviticus 19:18 , which commands that we show love to our neighbor. Our concern for the safety of our fellow man is a reflection of how God cares for and protects us. The Deuteronomy Scripture was commanded at a time when the roofs of houses were flat living areas, and it was intended to keep our families, our neighbors, and ourselves safe from falling off. The general principle of this Mitzvah that is derived from Scripture is that we should take responsibility for the safety of ourselves and others by removing dangerous conditions from areas that are under our control. While most roofs today are not flat living spaces, some still are, and there are other conditions of danger that we must not allow to exist such as unfenced or uncovered swimming pools, the harboring of unchained vicious animals,
    dangerous implements and substances left accessible to children, etc.; there are too many to list them all.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides' positive mitzvah RP184 requires that we remove conditions of danger from our homes, and his negative mitzvah RN298 commands that we not cause or allow dangerous conditions to exist, or leave obstacles that could cause injury in either public or private places. Meir's positive mitzvah MP75 requires that we erect a fence around our roofs and remove all obstacles in our house upon which a person can trip and fall, and his negative mitzvah MN190 is related to it in that it prohibits allowing any dangerous condition in our houses to persist. HaChinuch's two mitzvot run parallel to those of Meir, so Maimonides is the only one of the three who extends responsibility for safety to public areas.

  commandment: We are to give respect and honor to persons of advanced age.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah directs us to honor and respect persons of advanced age for two important reasons. First, those who have lived longer than we are assumed to have acquired wisdom through their greater life experiences, and presumably also through walking with the Lord for a longer period of time. Second, whatever knowledge and wisdom younger people may have, they have likely acquired (in large measure) through the life experiences and God-given wisdom of their elders 2 including from their parents ( Proverbs 22:6 ). Why is this Mitzvah needed? Regrettably, it is because, too frequently, persons of advanced age are not respected. I suggest that the reason for this is because older persons, over time, lose some of their physical attributes that are visible, while the ways in which they gain (knowledge, wisdom, and experience) are less visible and less tangible. When Moses needed help governing Israel, he chose seventy men of advanced age who were already respected leaders.
    It is also why 1 Timothy 3:2-12 instructs us that when we ordain elders to govern our New Covenant communities, each appointee must (among other things) be a man who is "above reproach", "faithful to his wife", "self-controlled", "able to teach", be a good manager "of his own household", have "children who obey him with all proper respect", and he must not be a new believer. All of these come to a man over time and with age, and it is why they are called "elders". Although the Scriptures that pertain to this subject refer mainly to men, women are included as well. Women are, of course, to be honored and obeyed as mothers regardless of their age ( Exodus 20:12 ; Ephesians 6:1-3 ), but older women, in particular, are exhorted to conduct their lives in holiness so that they are able to train younger women in the ways of the Lord ( Titus 2:3-5 ). Because men, regardless of their abilities, are not competent (nor is it appropriate for them) to train women in many areas, women who have wisdom
    and experience that comes with advanced age and who are also filled with the Holy Spirit, are exceedingly valuable and are needed in every community. 2. "Elders" here means persons who are older.
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides'', Meir''s, and HaChinuch''s mitzvot that are based on Leviticus 19:32 , command that we honor persons of advanced age and Torah scholars despite the fact that the Scripture says nothing about scholars. Most of what they write has to do with the particulars of how we extend honor, and their writings on this are fairly complex and legalistic. To give a sense of it, here is a brief quote from Meir''s MP17 from Charles Wengrove''s English adaptation of " Concise Book of Mitzvoth ": 3 The term sevah ("a man of hoary head") means someone of very advanced age, even if he is not a man of wisdom. One is duty-bound to stand before him - even a wise scholar who is very young; but he is not obligated to stand up to his full height before him [the old man], but only enough to honor him. The term zaken means zeh she-kanah chochmah , one who has acquired wisdom. Even if he is very young, one is to stand up to his full height before him, from the time he [the scholar]
    comes within four cubits until he has left his presence. Meir''s treatment of the subject goes on to speak of honoring to one''s Torah teacher, and concludes by saying: Whoever disgraces such scholars will have no share in the world-to-come. 3. Yisrael Meir haKohen, The Concise Book of Mitzvoth (The Commandments Which Can Be Observed Today), Charles Wengrov, translator, p. 31 (Jerusalem / New York: Feldheim Publishers, 1990).'

  commandment: We are duty-bound to help a person who needs rescue provided it is reasonably within our ability to do so.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: '" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you " is the well-known "golden rule", but it does not appear in the Bible in that form. What is in the Bible is Mark 12:30-31 , which states: ''... and you are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your understanding and with all your strength.'' The second is this: ''You are to love your neighbor as yourself.'' There is no other mitzvah greater than these. Applying that principle, Scripture teaches that we have a duty to help others, even to try to save the life of a person who is attacked. What is unclear is whether the duty applies even if it puts the protector in danger and, because Scripture is silent on the matter, I will not speculate. The parable of the "good Samaritan" is the classic Scripture that lauds assisting a person who has been attacked, but it is noteworthy that at no time was the "good Samaritan" in danger since he gave his help after the attack on the injured man
    had occurred. Nevertheless, he helped the stranger in need by spending his own time and money. Interestingly, some U.S. States have adopted what they call the "Good Samaritan Law" which does not require that a bystander help a person who is in distress, but states that if he does and causes injury in the process, he cannot be sued for his attempt.'
  classical_commentators: The mitzvah that Maimonides and HaChinuch glean from Scripture is that we must seek to save the life of one who is attacked even if it requires killing the attacker. In reaching this conclusion they rely on Deuteronomy 25:11-12 in a very strange way, which is to construe that the man who is attacking the other is not trying to kill him, but that the wife who comes to her husband's aid (by grabbing the attacker's private parts) is trying to kill the attacker, and thereby becomes a lethal attacker herself. That is why Scripture commands that we must show no pity on her and cut off her hand. Meir did not address the subject.

  commandment: We are to be salt for the earth and a light for the world.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Because salt is essential for life, it is used in the Bible to symbolize life. Related to it, light is used in the Bible to symbolize godly knowledge and understanding that leads to life. Yeshua said of himself in John 9:5 : While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. And yet, in Matthew 5:14 he told his disciples: You are light for the world. Could both be true? Yes, both were true, for he told his disciples in John 12:35 : The light will be with you only a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, or the dark will overtake you; he who walks in the dark doesn''t know where he''s going. Yeshua was letting his disciples know that he was going away, but that he was going to transfer his light to them so that when he left, his light would remain. The Bible uses "light" to symbolize revelation and understanding as far back as Genesis 1:3 and, in Isaiah 49:5-6 , Israel is said to be a "light to the Gentiles" (i.e. the rest of the world). Therefore, when
    Yeshua imparted his light to the original Jewish disciples (today all who believer in Yeshua are his disciples), he did so with the expectation that they/we would disseminate it throughout the world in his behalf. "Salt" is also used symbolically in the Bible. In addition to salt being an intrinsic part of our bodies and therefore necessary for life, it is used to preserve food and to make food flavorful. By Yeshua saying that we (his disciples) are to be salt for the earth, and by his warning to us not to lose our saltiness, he is sending us forth to minister the truth and life of God through both our words and through our "enlightened" examples that others who have need of knowing God would want to emulate.'

  commandment: We are to acknowledge & appropriately utilize our spiritual authority to "bind" & "loose".
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Amazing as it seems, disciples of Yeshua have been given spiritual authority to permit or prohibit things to happen on earth that are reflected in heaven. This is sometimes referred to as "binding" and "loosing", and is conditioned upon our using the authority in a way that is consistent with God''s will. The authority is given to us as servants of Yeshua, and whereas it is our decision when to use it, it must be understood that we do so "in the name of Yeshua", and that it is Yeshua and not we that brings the result to pass. 1 "Loosing" from disease and "binding" of healing is a spiritual authority we have been given among others. According to the Scripture, we have authority (in the name of Yeshua) to declare healing, to cast out demons, and even to raise from the dead. In the western world we experience our authority to cast out demons fairly often, to heal not so often, and to raise from the dead almost never. We do, however, receive testimonies from believers
    of these happening in other parts of the world where all three appear to be substantially active. Why not also here in the western world is speculative. A special explanation is needed concerning our authority to forgive sins pursuant to John 20:23 , as we generally consider that in Yeshua''s exclusive domain. John 20:23 states: If you forgive someone''s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you hold them, they are held. Clearly, this is an extension and secondary application of our authority to "bind" and "loose", but it is limited to sins that are committed against us personally and is not authority to forgive sins generally. One way to understand this is to first consider Luke 17:3-4 , which commands us to forgive sins that are committed against us if the perpetrator of the sins repents ( Luke 17:3-4 ). God gives that authority to the victims of sin in order to put a burden on the perpetrator to approach the person he or she injured and try to make it right. The John 20:23 Scripture should
    be looked at in the same way. Finally, batei din have authority to "bind" and "loose". Reminiscent of Deuteronomy 17:8-13 , God gives authority to our batei din to hear and decide cases, and He honors those beit din judgments that are appropriately rendered: Matthew 18:17-18: If he refuses to hear them, tell the congregation [the beit din]; and if he refuses to listen even to the congregation [beit din], treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector [unbeliever]. Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven. So, therefore, if a beit din makes such a finding we are to treat the adjudged person as no longer a believer. 2 1. It is not we who do the miracles, but rather they are caused by our declarations on earth being reflected in Heaven. 2. In the New Covenant, the judicial authority of the Apostles (and today''s elders) replaced that of the Sanhedrin .'

  commandment: We are not to preach the Word of God to those who are closed to it.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'One assumes that preaching holiness to persons closed to it is a waste of time, but Scripture goes beyond that and commands us not to do it because it is actually dangerous ( Matthew 7:6 & 10:16-17 ). That does not mean that we should refrain from preaching the Word of God to groups and individuals in the hope that some who hear it are open. It does however mean that we are to exercise discernment regarding the response we get, and not pursue those whom it is clear are closed because the Holy Spirit has not prepared them. Matthew 15:22-28 illustrates that Yeshua himself abided by the principle of this Mitzvah by at first ignoring the pleas of the Gentile woman from Canaan whom Yeshua assumed was begging him to heal her daughter out of desperation and not out of godly conviction. That would have been the case of most Gentiles in those days and Yeshua, having divested himself of his powers of deity, did not have insight beyond that of other men. However, when the woman
    responded to his rebuff with godly wisdom, Yeshua realized that, despite her being a Gentile she was a woman of faith, and he granted her request. Yeshua''s assumption that most Gentiles in those days were not yet ready to receive the things of God was why at first, Yeshua sent his disciples only to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" with the following instruction: Matthew 10:7-14: &nbps As you go, proclaim, ''The Kingdom of Heaven is near,'' heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those afflicted with tzara''at, expel demons. You have received without paying, so give without asking payment. Don''t take money in your belts, no gold, no silver, no copper; and for the trip don''t take a pack, an extra shirt, shoes or a walking stick- a worker should be given what he needs. When you come to a town or village, look for someone trustworthy and stay with him until you leave. When you enter someone''s household, say, ''Shalom aleikhem!'' If the home deserves it, let your shalom rest on
    it; if not, let your shalom return to you. But if the people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen to you, leave it and shake its dust from your feet! Later on, closer to the time when Yeshua would be returning to the Father and sending back the Holy Spirit, he broadened his instruction to his disciples to include the Gentiles: Matthew 10:18b-20: All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make people from all nations into talmidim, immersing them into the reality of the Father, the Son and the Ruach HaKodesh, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember! I will be with you always, yes, even until the end of the age. That notwithstanding, Yeshua''s instruction in verse 14 " But if the people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen to you, leave it and shake its dust from your feet! " applied to the Gentiles as well.'

  commandment: We are to go to the whole world with the "Great Commission" proclaimed by Yeshua, in the power of the Holy Spirit - first to the Jew and then to the Gentile.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The term "Great Commission" does not appear in the text of the Bible. Its origin is unknown, but the term appears to have been popularized by Hudson Taylor (nineteenth century) to refer to Yeshua's instruction to his original disciples (all Jews), to go to all nations and make the people from them into new disciples. They were instructed to immerse these new disciples into the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teach them obedience to the commandments of God as taught by Yeshua. According to Matthew 28:16-20 and Mark 16:14-18 , Yeshua's disciples were to preach to all the nations. Prior to that ( Matthew 10:5-8 ), they were given similar instructions but to go only to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel." This and several other Scriptures indicate that, whereas the "Good News" brought by Yeshua was (and is) meant for all peoples, it was (and is) exceptionally important that it be preached first to the Jews because they have the primary covenantal responsibility of
    reaching the Gentile world for God. This covenantal responsibility was first proclaimed to Abraham ( Genesis 3:8-9 , 26:4 ), and was later re-proclaimed through Moses ( Exodus 19:5-6 ). The Great Commission cannot be accomplished without the power of the Holy Spirit. We read in John 14:15-26 of how, when Yeshua left the earth to be with his Father in heaven, the Father would send back the Holy Spirit. And in Acts 1:8 , we read that Yeshua's disciples had to wait for power from the Holy Spirit before they could effectively be Yeshua's witnesses. Finally (and consistent with that), we read in Matthew 10:5-8 and Mark 16:20 that the effectiveness of the disciples' witness to the non-believing world was largely due to supernatural signs of power that were provided by the Holy Spirit. It is just as true for those of us who are Yeshua's disciples today.

  commandment: We are not to cast demons out of persons who, through their lack of faith or repentance, are unable to maintain the deliverance.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'In Matthew 10:5-8 we read of how Yeshua''s disciples were sent out to minister to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" with Holy Spirit power that included power to cast out demons. Earlier in the Scriptures, we see numerous examples of Yeshua casting out demons and expecting his disciples to do the same. For example, in Matthew 17:20 ( verse 21 in NKJ) we read of how, after seeing Yeshua cast out a demon, his disciples were perplexed by not being able to cast it out themselves: And he said to them: "Because you have such little trust! Yes! I tell you that if you have trust as tiny as a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, ''Move from here to there!'' and it will move; indeed, nothing will be impossible for you!" In another Scripture ( Mark 9:28-29 ), we read: After Yeshua had gone indoors, his talmidim asked him privately, "Why couldn''t we drive it out?" He said to them "This is the kind of spirit that can be driven out only by prayer." Because
    the Holy Spirit is with us today as he was during and after the time of Yeshua, we too have the power to cast out demons in Yeshua''s name. That notwithstanding, we are cautioned by the Scriptures that underlay this Mitzvah not to do so if we perceive that the person who is the subject of the ministry cannot hold the deliverance due principally to lack of faith or continued or un-repented sin.'

  commandment: The Jewish people (Israel) are to embrace being a kingdom of priests in order to bring blessing to the Gentile nations of the world. Jews & Gentiles both are called to join in a New Covenant "Priesthood of Believers" that consists of all disciples of Yeshua, and that is connected to the first priesthood - the priesthood of Israel.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is formulated from Scriptures distributed throughout the Bible that describe, in detail, how God made Israel (i.e. the Jewish People) into a "Kingdom of Priests", and later created a New Covenant priesthood with followers of Yeshua joined to Israel in a "Commonwealth" that conists of both Jews and Gentiles. Israel''s calling to be a Kingdom of Priests was imparted to it by God (through Abraham and later through Moses), so all Jews (regardless of their belief in Messiah) are members of a priestly people. That notwithstanding, in the New Covenant, only those Jews who believe in Yeshua, i.e. who are "born of the Spirit" and consequently reside as branches on the Romans 11:16ff olive tree (a tree that belongs to the Jews), can function in their full power as New Covenant priests; Jews who do not believe in Yeshua have priestly potential and a continued degree of priestly effectiveness, but they cannot serve as true New Covenant priests until they come to faith
    in Yeshua. When Gentiles come to faith, they become grafted into the aforesaid olive tree and join their Jewish brethren there as co-priests. Although they (the Gentiles) do not become Jews by virtue of their having been grafted in, the priesthood they become joined to (sometimes referred to as the "Priesthood of Believers") is fundamentally a Jewish priesthood. Yet, the Bible makes it clear that the Jews in this Priesthood retain their Jewish identities and Jewish covenantal responsibilities. The origin of all of this goes back to Genesis 12:1-3 , where God gave Avram a covenant whereby through him " all the families of the earth would be blessed. " Avram''s name was later changed to Avraham (Abraham) and, over several Genesis chapters, we read that God promised that he would become " the father of many nations ", that his wife Sarai (whose name was changed to Sarah) would bear him a son, and that, through Abraham''s descendants, " all the nations of the earth would be blessed. " (
    Genesis 17:3-7, 15-21, 22:10-18, 26:1-5, & 28:10-14 ). The Priestly Covenant given to Abraham was transmitted through Isaac and later Jacob ( Genesis 17:3-7, 26:3-4, 27:29, 28:12-14, & 35:10-12 ), and was declared by God (at Mt. Sinai) to the entire Nation of Israel by His words: ... you will be a kingdom of cohanim [priests] for me, a nation set apart (Exodus 19:3-6) The Tribe of Levi was set apart from the rest of Israel to serve God in the Tabernacle (later the Temple), and Aaron and his sons were further set apart to serve as priests. This became known as the Levitical Priesthood in the "Order of Aaron" because Aaron was its first High Priest. It was the functioning priesthood for its time, and the shadow of a heavenly priesthood (later to be revealed) in which Yeshua the Messiah would be High Priest in the Order of Malki-Tzedek ( Hebrews 3:1-2, 4:14-15, 5:4-6, 6:19-20, 7:17-8:13, 9:6-12, 24-26, & 10:19-23 ). Levites and Levitical cohanim (known descendants of Levi and Aaron) continue
    to have functions and responsibilities in the synagogues and Jewish Communities of today. These include performing special duties in the Torah service, pronouncing blessings over the synagogue assembly, officiating at Pidyon HaBenim , and several others. From the time of Abraham to the present time, all the covenants that God made were with the Jewish people, and the priesthoods related to them were Jewish-based priesthoods. The Law given at Mt. Sinai that created and defined the Levitical Priesthood did not allow Gentiles and non-Levitical Jews to perform priestly services in the Temple, but the New Covenant opened the way for both to become priests by joining themselves to the Romans 11 "Jewish" olive tree through faith in the "Jewish" Messiah Yeshua. Just as the Levitical priests had duties related to the Temple''s animal sacrifices, New Covenant priests have duties related to the sacrificed "lamb of God" Yeshua. In Matthew 28:16-20 and parallel Scriptures, we read that Yeshua directed
    His disciples (all Jews) to go and make people from all nations into talmidim (disciples), immersing them into the reality of the Father, the Son and the Ruach HaKodesh, and teaching them to obey everything [they had been commanded]. This commandment to preach the "Good News" of Yeshua to the utmost ends of the earth (commonly referred to as the "Great Commission") is the main priestly duty of the "Yeshua Priesthood of Believers". It is the New Covenant counterpart of Temple service but, unlike Temple service, it is open to (in fact it is required of) all disciples of Yeshua, whether they be Jews or Gentiles. Finally, according to Romans 1:16, 2:9-11 , "Great Commission" ministry must be: ... to the Jew first and then to the Gentile. This is not because God prefers Jews over Gentiles, but because Jews were made by God to be His foundational kingdom of priests ( Exodus 19:3-6 ) who must become spiritually capable to where they are able to support the "Priesthood of Believers" and bring
    God''s blessings to the Gentile nations of the world ( Genesis 22:16-18 ). This is the same principle of priestly preparation that we read about in Leviticus 16:3-6 , where Aaron the High Priest was required to perform a sacrifice for himself and his family before he could act as a priest for others on Yom Kippur .'
  classical_commentators: None of the classical commentators (Maimonides, Meir, nor HaChinuch) include, among their mitzvot , any obligation for Levites to perform priestly duties outside of the Temple, except those connected to health and blessing the Jewish People.

  commandment: Cohanim (priests) are to pray blessing over God's people.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Levitical Cohanim (Aaron and his sons) were commanded to bless the "People of Israel" (the Jewish People) who, at that time, were the only people group in covenant with God. The blessing (referred to today as the Birkat Cohanim or the Aaronic Benediction) was to be given using the exact words recorded in Numbers 6:24-26 , the purpose of which was for the Cohanim to put God's Name on the Jewish People, thereby identifying whom God Himself would bless. Clearly, God did not need the Cohanim to tell Him who the Jewish People were, so the commandment was no doubt intended more as an impartation of authority, informing the Cohanim that what they declared on earth (in the way of blessing) would be made a reality in heaven - a concept that was to be reiterated years later by Messiah Yeshua (see Matthew 16:19 ). In the New Covenant, all believers in Yeshua are elevated to the status of priests ( Cohanim ) under Yeshua ( 1 Peter 2:5-12 ) who, Scripture teaches, is our High
    Priest ( Hebrews 4:14 ; Revelation 1:4-6 ). Extrapolating from Numbers 6:22-27 , I therefore conclude that, as was required of Aaron and his sons, we who are New Covenant Cohanim , through our belief in Yeshua, are also required to pray blessing upon the Jewish People; and not only upon them, but also upon the newest "People of God" as well - all who believe in Yeshua - both Jews and non-Jews. And there is good biblical evidence that our responsibility to bless does not stop there, but extends even to the world's unbelievers through our bringing them the Good News of Yeshua and praying for their salvation ( Matthew 9:36-38, 28:16-20 ; James 5:16 ). Although Hebrews 8:13 indicates that the Mosaic Covenant is diminishing and is in the process of vanishing, it is never said, in Scripture, to have already vanished. Without the Temple, Levitical Cohanim today have few functions, but those remaining include ceremonially blessing the Jewish People with the Birkat Cohanim ( Numbers 6:22-27 ),
    receiving special aliyot to read from the Torah , and participating in redeeming a Jewish family's firstborn son ( Pidyon HaBen - Numbers 18:15 ). In Orthodox Judaism, only Levitical Cohanim are authorized to minister the Birkat Cohanim , but in other denominations, others may do so. In Messianic Judaism, for example, it may be prayed over a congregation by a Levitical Cohen if one is available, but often the Rabbi, the Chazan (Cantor), or other officiating leader ministers it at a service's conclusion in reliance upon his New Covenant priestly status. Since the New Covenant priesthood is not limited to Jews, Gentile leaders are also authorized to minister it. The matter of women leading synagogue services is controversial; in my opinion, women should not be in that position of authority and should therefore not minister the Birkat HaCohanim . Those that believe otherwise, however, rely on the undisputed fact that the New Covenant priesthood extends to women as well as to men.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides says that Cohanim must bless Israel every day, but does not say it has to be with the Numbers 6:24-26 text. Meir does not say that the blessing must be given every day, but does say that it must be given during a service and the text in Numbers 6:24-26 must be used. HaChinuch concurs with Maimonides that the Cohanim must bless Israel every day, and gives many more particulars on how it is to be done. Two of the particulars are that the Birkat HaCohanim that must be imparted is just " Sim Shalom ", and that the Cohe n delivering the blessing must position his hands in a special way.

We see this continuing in the Mosaic Covenant where Israel is made by God to be a "kingdom of priests ( cohanim ), a nation set apart" ( Exodus 19:5-6 ), and Aaron and his sons are installed as priests ( Exodus 28:1-3 ), also "set apart" ( Leviticus 21:8 ). Then, later, in the New Covenant, Yeshua is made a High Priest ( Cohen Gadol ) in the order of Malki-Tzedek ( Hebrews 5:4-6 ), and all disciples of Yeshua are made cohanim under Him ( 2 Peter 2:9-10 ). Notwithstanding the change in the covenant ( Hebrews 8:13 ) and our loss of the Jerusalem Temple, the Judaism that survives today retains a few functions for those believed to be descended (patrilinearly) from the early Levitical cohanim . 1 Among these functions are making aliyot to the bima (going up to read
    from the Torah during services), the privilege of redeeming firstborn Jewish sons (the ceremony of Pidyon HaBen ), and imparting the Birkat Cohanim (Priestly Blessing or Aaronic Benediction) over synagogue congregants. In Messianic Jewish congregations, the Birkat Cohanim is generally ministered by the presiding leader of a service in recognition of the New Covenant's expansion of priestly holiness to all believers. 1. Historically, cohanim were only men; today, however, there is a movement within Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism to extend the status of cohanim to women; this is not generally accepted within Messianic Judaism.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch are unified in stating that a cohen should be treated with honor befitting his inherited identity. He should be made to be first in all matters of holiness, the first to be called to Torah , the first to say the blessing at meals, and the first to be served. This deference to the cohen's holiness should be made regardless of the cohen's willingness to accept it.

  commandment: We are to embrace our New Covenant priesthood and ability to enter God's Most Holy Place through our High Priest Yeshua.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'One of the most significant aspects of the New Covenant brought by Yeshua''s sacrificial death and resurrection is elevating to priesthood, those of us that repent of our sins and receive him as Lord. In the Mosaic Covenant, Israel was made by God to be a kingdom of priests, and later in the New Covenant, he extended priesthood (not the same priesthood) to all believers in Yeshua - Jews and Gentiles alike. There was another priesthood that was part of the Mosaic Covenant - the Levitical Priesthood - in which Aaron was the High Priest. Only Aaron could enter the Most Holy Place and then, only once a year on Yom Kippur . Under the Levitical Priesthood, ordinary priests could not enter the Most Holy Place, and were therefore limited in how close to God they could come. Today''s Priesthood of Believers is a superior priesthood in that through our High Priest Yeshua, all believers in Yeshua can enter the Most Holy Place in Heaven, and draw closer to God than the Levitical
    priests could. It is one of the reasons that Hebrews 8:6 can state: But now the work Yeshua has been given to do is far superior to theirs, just as the covenant he mediates is better. For this covenant has been given as Torah on the basis of better promises.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides and HaChinuch each wrote their mitzvot (RN68 and C184 respectively) as though the Holy Temple of God was still standing. They state that the High Priest can only enter the Temple's sanctuary at a prescribed time once a year. Meir did not write a mitzvah on the subject.

  commandment: Priests are not to marry persons who are likely to compromise their holiness.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Leviticus 21:7 commands that a Levitical cohen is not to marry a zonah (a harlot), a chalalah (a woman who has been profaned) 1 , or a g''rushah (divorcee). Its clear application was for when the Jerusalem Temple was fully functioning, in order to dissuade cohanim from marrying women who would compromise their ritual purity and disqualify them from Temple service. This has application even today, by those who look toward a future restored Temple ( Ezekiel 40-47 ) that is accompanied by a restored Levitical priesthood (e.g. Orthodox Judaism applies the Scripture literally and without exception to men they believe to be cohanim ). 2 Conservative Judaism has ruled differently. Regarding the marriage of a cohen to a divorcee, in 1954, the "Committee on Jewish Law and Standards" (CJLS) of the Conservative Jewish Movement adopted a 1952 responsum written by R. Ben Zion Bokser authorizing Rabbinical Assembly rabbis to join cohanim and divorcees in marriage without interfering
    with the cohen''s status. 3 This was incorporated in R. Arnold M. Goodman''s paper titled " Solemnizing the Marriage between a Cohen and Divorcee ", which was adopted by the CJLS in 1996, and which contains the following paragraph: We also regard divorce differently than did our Biblical and Rabbinic forbearers. We no longer perceive the divorced woman as being guilty of [an unsavory act]. To exclude a Jewish woman who is divorced from marrying the man with whom she is in love, affirms the negative status of the divorcee. This is inconsistent with our view of divorce or of our assessment of the character of a woman who happens to be g''rushah [divorced]. Messianic Judaism''s view of a priest marrying a divorcee is similar but more complex, because we (unlike other branches of Judaism) contend that the New Covenant has replaced (or is in the process of replacing) the Covenant that created and gave function to the Levitical priesthood in the first place ( Hebrews 8:13 ). It is also more
    complex for us because we profess the existence of a New Covenant priesthood that consists of all believers in Messiah Yeshua, both men and women. Most Messianic Jewish scholars and leaders interpret Ezekiel 40-47 as applying to a Temple that will someday be rebuilt and, in which, certain sacrifices will resume. We do not believe that the sin-related sacrifices will resume (since Yeshua has become our sacrifice ( Hebrews 9:11-14 ; 10:1-14 )), nor that the presiding priests in the rebuilt Temple will necessarily be Levitical. Nevertheless, we tend to follow the Conservative Jewish Movement''s point of view, and their practice of allowing both men and women descendants of Aaron to marry divorced persons ( g''rushot ) without any penalty to their perceived priestly status. We make an exception, however, in the case of a divorce that was biblically unauthorized, and the divorcee, while claiming to be a believer in Yeshua, either caused it or procured it. In that case, remarriage by the divorcee
    might be prohibited regardless of the intended spouse''s identity. Such matters should be decided by a bet din of elders. Regarding the other biblical prohibitions of Leviticus 21:7 - a cohen marrying a zonah and a cohen marrying a chalalah - the Scripture is speaking to the Levitical cohanim of the Mosaic Covenant, but it has application in the New Covenant as well. In Temple times, marrying a zonah or chalalah would have adversely affected a cohen ''s ritual purity, and would have disqualified him from serving in the Temple. The New Covenant extension of this is that no priests - neither men nor women - neither Jews nor Gentiles - neither those who are priests by virtue of their faith in Yeshua nor those who are priests by virtue of their Levitical inheritance - no priests of God (which means none of us) are to be yoked in marriage to persons who are likely to compromise our holiness and therefore our effectiveness in serving God. Every covenant we are in yokes us to our covenant partners
    for better or worse, and the covenant of marriage is no exception. Both through our own marriages and through observing the marriages of others, we are keenly aware of how profoundly our spouse can affect the holiness of our thoughts and actions. The person we choose to marry becomes our life partner in whatever priestly ministry God expects of us, and he or she will either help or hinder. That is why, for both our own sakes and for God''s, it is vital that we not marry persons who are likely to compromise our holiness and resulting ability to fulfill our priestly responsibilities. 1. A woman of defective cohen status 2. See, e.g., the Amidah , Benediction #17; The ArtScroll Siddur , pp. 110-111, (New York: Mesorah Publications, Ltd., 2006). 3. Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly, 1954, pp. 55-61.'
  classical_commentators: Of the three commentators compared herein, Chinuch is the only one who is expansive on the subject of how marriage is related to holiness. He states that the underlying purpose of the three prohibitions in Leviticus 21:7 is to preserve the cohen 's ritual purity for his priestly service to God. HaChinuch and Meir point out an irony of the mitzvah that prohibits marriage to a zonah . It is that a woman who copulates with an animal is liable to death by stoning, but she is not a zonah because her copulation was not with a man. By inference, therefore, a cohen is not forbidden from marrying her - a strange result of logic. HaChinuch and Meir define a chalalah as a woman who is the product of a marriage that is prohibited to a cohen , or as a woman who has been intimate with a cohen whom she was forbidden to marry. Neither Maimonides, nor Meir, nor HaChinuch comment much about the prohibition against marrying a g'rushah , nor do they make any exceptions for unusual
    or contemporary circumstances that might be different from those of antiquity.

  commandment: Priests are not to minister to others while they are spiritually unclean and in need of repentance.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Leviticus 11, 21, and 22 Scriptures quoted above are cited by Maimonides and HaChinuch as cumulatively commanding the Levitical cohanim of old to refrain from ministering in the Holy Sanctuary while they are ceremonially unclean. I have expressed my view elsewhere in this book, that ceremonial cleanness (ritual purity) in the Tabernacle and Holy Temple of old are analogous to repentant holiness today when our New Covenant Temples are not of brick and mortar, but are our physical bodies ( 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 ). Since Scripture teaches that we who are Yeshua''s disciples are priests under His New Covenant Priesthood ( 1 Peter 2:4-5, 9-10 ), how much more must the commandment to the Levitical cohanim apply to us! We must therefore refrain from ministering to others while we ourselves are spiritually unclean and in need of repentance. That is not an invitation to "stop ministering" - it is a commandment to "repent before ministering." This principle that a priest
    had to be spiritually clean before he could minister in the Temple was operative even as far back as Moses. We find a powerful example of this in Leviticus 16:5-11, 15-19 , which commands the Cohen Gadol (on Yom Kippur ) to first sacrifice a bull for himself and his family before he could conduct sacrifices in behalf of the people of Israel. Matthew 5:23-24 teaches that if we have sinned against our brother (or he thinks we have), we are to make things right with our brother (i.e. repent of our sin and reconcile with him) even before presenting our offering to God. That of course speaks of a time when animal sacrifices were still being offered in the Holy Temple, but the application for today is clear: We should not think that we can have a reconciled relationship with our Father in heaven without first repenting of our sins and reconciling with our brother on earth. Matthew 7:3-5 and Luke 6:41-42 teach a related lesson using the example of a splinter in the eye - something with which
    we are all familiar. The smallest splinter in our eye is so disabling to our sight that it might as well be an entire log. The splinter and log are symbolic of sin, and we are instructed to correct ourselves and repent of our own sin (that blocks our sight and judgment) before we are qualified and able to minister correction and repentance to our brother.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides' mitzvah RN75 and HaChinuch's corresponding mitzvah C278 prohibit cohanim from ministering in the Temple sanctuary while they are ceremonially unclean; there is no Meir counterpart. Also, Maimonides' mitzvah RN76 and HaChinuch's corresponding mitzvah C265 prohibit cohanim who are t'vul yom (bathed but unclean until sundown) from serving in the Temple sanctuary; there is no Meir counterpart of this mitzvah either. I do not see how Maimonides and HaChinuch derive their respective mitzvot from the Scriptures they cite, but other Scriptures on the subject make it clear that they are correct.

  commandment: Levitical Priests are not to be in the vicinity of a dead body unless the deceased is a close relative.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: It is natural for members of a community to want to be with, and comfort members of a grieving family while they are mourning the loss of a loved one. Nevertheless, Leviticus 21:1 prohibits Levitical cohanim from being anywhere near a dead body lest they become ritually unclean and unfit for their Temple duties. In modern times, the Scripture has been applied in several different ways by different rabbinical authorities, including not permitting supposed male descendants of Aaron to be in the same room as a dead person, nor even on cemetery grounds. The prohibition of course had a practical purpose when the Tabernacle and Temple functioned with the Levitical Priesthood conducting sacrifices, but it is not the case today. Nevertheless, in anticipation of the Temple being rebuilt ( Ezekiel 40-47 ) and the sacrifices being restored, Orthodox and Conservative Judaism continue the practice of not allowing men whom they believe are descended from Aaron to come near to a dead
    body. Reform Judaism does not follow the practice because Reform Judaism does not recognize the continuity of priestly lineage. Leviticus 21:2-3 is an exception to the prohibition when the deceased person is a close relative. Not only is it an exception - it is considered a positive commandment by the classical commentators, that a priest allow himself to be rendered ritually unclean in that circumstance for the sake of his relative. Some Messianic Jewish congregations follow Conservative Judaism in this, others do not, and still others have not developed a policy on these issues at all. Messianic Jewish scholars and leaders that follow Conservative Jewish practices interpret Ezekiel chapters 40-47 to be prophecy, that the Holy Temple will eventually be rebuilt, and that certain sacrifices will be resumed - possibly conducted by a restored Levitical priesthood. All believers in Yeshua know that restored sacrifices cannot be for the commission of sin since Yeshua is our sacrifice for
    sin ( Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:1-14 ); furthermore, we do not know whether the priests conducting sacrifices in a restored Temple will be "Levitical" or of some other priestly order. Nevertheless, in compliance with Jewish tradition, Messianic Judaism generally follows the practice of shielding "assumed" cohanim from being near dead bodies, with the understanding that it is voluntary on their part. 1 . This Mitzvah applies only to males. It does not apply to females because Leviticus 21:1 refers to "sons of Aaron", and because only males served in the Tabernacle and the Holy Temple as priests. Messianic Judaism does not apply this Mitzvah to New Covenant priests (i.e. to believers in Yeshua). 1. Since the Temple's records have been lost, there is no official record of whose unbroken patrilineal descent is traceable to Aaron. Consequently, family names such as "Cohen", "Kohen", "Cone", "Cowen", etc., in addition to family histories and traditions are relied upon.
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and Chinuch all take the Orthodox approach of considering Leviticus 21:1-4 and 6 to consist of two commandments - a negative one prohibiting a cohen from being in the vicinity of a dead body, and a positive one requiring that a cohen disregard the prohibition in the case where the deceased person is his close relative. Also, all three commentators agree that the commandments apply only to men.

  commandment: We are to listen to & heed God's voice.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is related to the Mitzvah on "Obeying Torah ". The emphasis here is somewhat different however, in that this Mitzvah has to do with listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit and allowing Him to guide us on how God''s Commandments should be applied in our particular circumstances. What it means to obey God''s commandments (those written down by Moses) is clear, but what is not so clear is what listening to God''s voice means. Rabbinical Judaism would say that it is referring to an "Oral Torah " - words allegedly spoken to Moses that were not written down, but rather conveyed verbally (as an oral tradition) from generation-to-generation. I do not believe that, nor do I believe that listening to God''s voice is a mere metaphor for understanding what the written words of Torah say, nor does it mean hearing the words of Torah read aloud. Scripture is clear that, in the New Covenant, we are able to hear God speak to us (usually in a still small voice within
    us) by means of the Holy Spirit. At the time of Elijah, the New Covenant had not yet come in His fullness, yet Elijah was able to hear that still small voice of God because he was gifted with the Holy Spirit; consider 1 Kings 19:11-12 : He [the angel] said, ''Go outside, and stand on the mountain before ADONAI''; and right then and there, ADONAI went past. A mighty blast of wind tore the mountains apart and broke the rocks in pieces before ADONAI, but ADONAI was not in the wind. After the wind came an earthquake, but ADONAI was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, fire broke out; but ADONAI was not in the fire. And after the fire came a quiet, subdued voice. The Israelites of old heard and were guided by God''s voice in primarily three ways - audibly from Mount Sinai (rarely) (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:32-33 ), from angels (e.g. Exodus 23:20-22 ) or from prophets (e.g. Numbers 12:6 ; Deuteronomy 18:17-18 ) who were specially gifted to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit, and repeat it
    to the inquirer. God''s Voice can be heard today at least as clearly as it was in the past, because today we have the great gift of the New Covenant that was prophesied in Jeremiah 31:30-33(31-34) , whereby the Torah is written on our hearts by the Holy Spirit who dwells within each and every one of us who will receive Him. Today, each of us we can hear God''s voice in the same way as (in fact, more clearly than) the prophets of old heard Him; as Jeremiah prophesied, we no longer have to inquire of our neighbor or brother, for we all can know and hear Him ourselves. It is clear to me that God''s voice is and always has been the voice of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, God speaks through His written commandments, but it is the Holy Spirit that gives the commandments voice for application in our individual lives and circumstances. 1 Expecting to hear God''s Voice with a mind to obey it is very important if we are to have an intimate and loving relationship with God ( John 14:15, 21 ) - so much
    so that Romans 8:14 says of it: All who are led by God''s Spirit are God''s sons. Because men''s hearing of God''s voice can be faulty, we are admonished to by 1 Thessalonians 5:21 test everything [and] hold onto what is good It is the approach used by the men of Berea who " welcomed Paul''s message ", but engaged in checking the Tanakh every day to see if the things Sha''ul was saying were true ( Acts 17:11 ). 2 1. English translations of Deuteronomy 28:1-2 and 18 generally use the word "obey" when referring to (God''s commandments), and "listen to" when referring to (the sound of God''s voice). That notwithstanding, the Hebrew word used for both "obey" and "listen to" in these Scriptures is the same - a derivation of the word ( sh''ma ), and so the two functions of listening and obeying cannot be separated. On the other hand, derivations of Hebrew words (commandments) and (sound of voice) are both used in the Deuteronomy Scriptures and, since these are not the same, God''s written
    Word and God''s voice must be thought of and dealt with differently. 2. See also 1 Corinthians 14:29'
  classical_commentators: The only mitzvot that touch on listening to God's voice are Maimonides' RP172, and HaChinuch's corresponding mitzvah C516. They interpret Deuteronomy 18:15-19 as our needing to listen to and obey all of God's prophets even if the prophets should instruct us to temporarily do the opposite of what appears to be a commandment in Scripture. I cannot agree with that interpretation; I believe that Deuteronomy 18:15-19 refers to only one prophet - Yeshua the Messiah - who had yet to come at the time the Commandment was given. And whereas Yeshua interpreted and applied the Mosaic commandments, he never nullified them. Meir does not include the subject of this Mitzvah in his compilation.

  commandment: We are to be born of, immersed in, filled and led by the Holy Spirit.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Today, the Holy Spirit is so identified with the New Covenant, that the reality of the Spirit''s ministry among men going back to creation is often overlooked. Except for historical studies, the rabbinical community and much of the Christian Church ignores the Holy Spirit, and relegates His work among men to the distant past. In fact, none of the Covenants that God made with men throughout the ages could have existed without the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit has always been the entity that allowed men to interact with God the Father. The order of the Scriptures presented in this Mitzvah shows the work of the Holy Spirit at various stages of history, and it is striking how similar and consistent His work has always been. He has always descended upon men, lived within men, filled men, empowered men, gifted men, counseled and led men and, enabled communication between men and God. The uniqueness of the New Covenant in regard to the Holy Spirit is not the newness
    of His work, but rather with whom He now interacts, and the intensity of the interaction. Prior to the New Covenant, the Holy Spirit enabled all men to speak to God (generally through prayer), but God was very particular about to whom He spoke back. He conversed with Adam, Noah, the patriarchs, Moses, and others, but they were always persons selected at His discretion. We call persons prophets if it is their function to hear God, and to repeat what they hear to others. As marvelous as God''s early form of interaction with men was, it was limited because the ordinary Israelite did not have general access to the Holy Spirit, and therefore had to consult with those that did have access, if he wanted to receive God''s guidance. It was like having a father whom you have never met, and with whom you can only converse by way of a messenger. That limitation changed dramatically in the New Covenant, when God fulfilled His promise through Joel to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh ( Joel 3:1 (2:28)
    ). Today, we are blessed to be able to relate to our heavenly father in a direct and personal way, and to be able to have conversations with Him, not only by our speaking to Him, but also by Him speaking back to us. Through the New Covenant, we have gained a relationship with God that most of us would not have had, had we lived prior to the time of Yeshua. Now that brings me to Yeshua, of whom I have not yet spoken. Yeshua is a critical part of the New Covenant, because His atoning sacrifice for us is what enables us to be cleansed of sin so that the Holy Spirit can live within us. Without Yeshua, we could not receive the Holy Spirit, and that is why Hebrews 9:13-15 says of Him, that He is the mediator of a New Covenant: For if sprinkling ceremonially unclean persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer restores their outward purity; then how much more the blood of the Messiah, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself to God as a sacrifice without blemish,
    will purify our conscience from works that lead to death, so that we can serve the living God! It is because of this death that he is mediator of a new covenant [or will]. Because a death has occurred which sets people free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promised eternal inheritance. There are two ways that we can utilize the gifts of the Holy Spirit that have been given to us in the New Covenant. We can use the gifts to enhance our personal lives, and we can use them to enhance the lives of others. There are a few among us who are specially gifted to equip others for ministry, and these we sometimes call the "fivefold gift ministers", a term that refers to the five ministries listed in Ephesians 4:11-12 . Furthermore, he gave some people as emissaries, some as prophets, some as proclaimers of the Good News, and some as shepherds and teachers. Their task is to equip God''s people for the work of service that builds
    the body of the Messiah ... Among the gifts of the Spirit, tongues tends to be the most spoken about because of confusion that has resulted from incorrect teaching. Three incorrect things that I have most often heard taught about tongues are: Speaking in tongues was a spiritual gift for the past only - not for today (this is sometimes said about all of the gifts of the Spirit). Those who do not speak in tongues are not saved. Speaking in tongues is a sign that one has been filled with (baptized in) the Holy Spirit, and those who do not speak in tongues have not been filled. I hope and trust that my earlier reference to 1 Corinthians 12:28-30 is sufficient to put the lie to #2 and #3 above: And God has placed in the Messianic Community first, emissaries; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those who work miracles; then those with gifts of healing; those with ability to help; those skilled in administration; and those who speak in various tongues. Not all are emissaries, are they?
    Not all are prophets, are they? or teachers? or miracle-workers? Not all have gifts of healing, not all speak in tongues, not all interpret, do they?) As for #1 above, and other gifts of the Holy Spirit, suffice it to say that the New Covenant, as we know it, could not exist without them. Now just a bit more about the "immersion" or "baptism of the Holy Spirit". First, the word "of" is incorrect, because it is not the Holy Spirit that Immerses - it is Yeshua that immerses us in the Holy Spirit ( Matthew 3:11 , etc.). More importantly, several Christian denominations teach that the "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" is a singular event of filling of the Spirit - a second work of grace that necessarily comes after one is born again. Both Scripture and life''s experiences testify that immersion in the Spirit need not be just a one-time occurrence ( Acts 9:22 and Ephesians 5:18-20 ), and it need not be a distinguishable second event after salvation because one can be filled with the Holy Spirit
    at the very moment that one is "born again". Consider Cornelius the God-fearer and others present when Peter preached the Good News of Yeshua in Cornelius'' home: Acts 10:44 Kefa was still saying these things when the Ruach HaKodesh fell on all who were hearing the message. Filling and refilling with the Holy Spirit can occur periodically throughout one''s life.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch did not accept that there is a New Covenant, and did not write on this subject of the Ru'ach HaKodesh .

  commandment: We are not to oppose or come against the Holy Spirit.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The Ru''ach Hakodesh is so often identified with the New Covenant, that the Spirit''s ministry going back to the creation is often overlooked. It is absolutely essential that we not oppose the Ru''ach Hakodesh in any manner because He is our relational and communication link to the Father and to Yeshua. Theologians debate the meaning of blaspheming the Holy Spirit, the one and only act that Scripture tells us is unforgiveable. Whatever it is, it cannot be easy to do, and if we are the least concerned about it, that alone is strong evidence that the Holy Spirit has not left us. The benefit of the New Covenant over the Mosaic Covenant (other than Yeshua''s sacrifice for our sins) is largely the ministry of the Holy Spirit and His willingness to dwell within us. In 1 Corinthians 6:19 the Shaliach Paul asks: ... don''t you know that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who lives inside you, whom you received from God? It is therefore absolutely essential that we
    do nothing to grieve or oppose the Holy Spirit in any manner. The Holy Spirit not only speaks to us individually, but He is also able to speak to us for others - sometimes in a language that we understand, and sometimes in a language that we do not understand unless we or someone else is able to interpret. We call the latter kind of language "tongues", and the Shaliach Paul is emphatic that we must not forbid prophesying in tongues (albeit it must be done in a right order, and with interpretation). Can we sin to a degree that God withdraws His Holy Spirit from us? The two examples provided above ( 1 Samuel 16:14 and Psalms 51:11 ) occurred prior to the New Covenant; David was worried about losing the Holy Spirit, and Saul actually did. In the New Covenant, we have Matthew 12:30-32 and Mark 3:28-29 that tell us that blaspheming the Holy Spirit is unforgiveable and results in an eternal sin. Scripture does not say that that involves loss of the Holy Spirit, but it certainly seems as though
    it does.'
  classical_commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch did not write about coming against the Ru'ach Hakodesh or losing the Ru'ach Hakodesh ; it is no doubt due to their not believing that the Apostolic Writings are Scripture, nor believing that we are in (and subject to) the New Covenant.

If a spirit bringing a teaching is God''s Spirit, what he says will be true; if not, it will be false. We must therefore test the spirit of everything that is proffered to us so that we are not misled; 1 John 4:2-3 tells us how: Here is how you recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges that Yeshua the Messiah came as a human being is from God, and every spirit which does not acknowledge Yeshua is not from God - in fact, this is the spirit of the Anti-Messiah.'

  commandment: We are not to have sexual contact with persons of our own gender.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Homosexuality in the Bible means any sexual contact with a person of one''s own gender. As in much in the Bible, the relevant verses of Scripture read as though they are written to men, but the New Covenant Scriptures make it clear that they apply to women as well ( Romans 1:26 ). The prohibited sexual contact referred to is not limited to physically touching another same sex''s genitals; it includes any display, touching, conversation, and probably even intentionally evoked personal thoughts of a homosexual nature, engaged-in in order to cause sexual arousal. All homosexual acts are sinful. On the other hand, the Scriptures do not call homosexual feelings (or any feelings) sin. There are some among us who (for reasons that only God knows) were born with a dysfunction such that their sexual feelings are not consistent with the gender of their physical genitalia. This is a most unhappy condition that they must deal with by control and abstinence (i.e. not allowing their
    actions to fulfill their desires), much as a heterosexual person must abstain from heterosexual activity that is scripturally prohibited. Persons having homosexual feelings that they do not act on should be received within the body of believers without reservation, but their condition should be viewed as abnormal, and prayer should not cease for their healing. Also, it is important that their congregation''s elders know about their condition because any slippage of the flesh in this area is almost certain to adversely affect others with whom they relate and come in contact. Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch only address male on male homosexuality in their mitzvot ; they do not discuss women. They opine that the expressions "uncover one''s nakedness" or "lie with" in the Bible mean to have sexual contact in which a male''s sex organ is physically inserted into another male''s orifice (mouth or anus). This is sometimes referred to as "sodomy". Special mention is made
    here of all three commentators'' peculiar interpretation of Leviticus 18:14 , which they interpret as not having homosexual relations with one''s father''s brother despite the Scripture speaking of one''s father''s brother''s wife.

  commandment: We are not to commit adultery.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Adultery is sexual intimacy between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse. The Scriptures on adultery in the Tanakh refer only to physical intimacy, but it is broader than that in the New Covenant, and even includes lusting after someone of the opposite sex, and divorcing without biblical grounds ( Matthew 5:27-28 ). Adultery is also mentioned in the New Covenant Scriptures as (arguably) the only reason that one may divorce a spouse (Some include abandonment and cite 1 Corinthians 7:15 ). The Scriptures usually quoted to support this are Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9 , which speak of fornication and sexual immorality; fornication during marriage is adultery. Adultery is one of the foundational prohibitions in the Bible because it negates the marital covenant of two becoming one ( Genesis 2:24 ; Matthew 19:4-5 ; Mark 10:7-8 ; and Ephesians 5:31 ). Not often discussed, however, is verse 32 that follows Ephesians 5:31 : There is profound truth hidden
    here, which I say concerns the Messiah and the Messianic Community. Some translations call it a profound mystery, so what might the mystery be? I believe that it refers to a husband-wife relationship that exists between Messiah and the Messianic Community, 1 a relationship within which adultery can be committed in the same way as with married couples. 1. Variously called the "Commonwealth of Israel", the "Body of Believers", and the "Church". Let''s see how that can happen; Yeshua is described as a "bridegroom" several times in Scripture: Mark 2:18-20 : Also Yochanan''s talmidim and the P''rushim were fasting; and they came and asked Yeshua, "Why is it that Yochanan''s talmidim and the talmidim of the P''rushim fast, but your talmidim don''t fast?" Yeshua answered them, "Can wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, fasting is out of the question. But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; and
    when that day comes, they will fast." John 3:28-29 : You yourselves can confirm that I did not say I was the Messiah, but that I have been sent ahead of him. The bridegroom is the one who has the bride; but the bridegroom''s friend, who stands and listens to him, is overjoyed at the sound of the bridegroom''s voice. So this joy of mine is now complete. Although the "bride" is only referenced in John 3:29 , her identity can be inferred from other Scriptures that speak of the "bridegroom" (a bridegroom has a bride) and also from Ephesians 5:22-24 : Wives should submit to their husbands as they do to the Lord; because the husband is head of the wife, just as the Messiah, as head of the Messianic Community, is himself the one who keeps the body safe. Just as the Messianic Community submits to the Messiah, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. This Scripture makes it clear that, by analogy, the Messiah is "husband" to the "Messianic Community" that is the "wife". Saying
    it another way, Yeshua is "bridegroom" to the "Commonwealth of Israel" who is the "bride" so, also by analogy, whenever a member of the bride (the Commonwealth of Israel) sins against Yeshua (the bridegroom) by pursuing the ways of other gods (sin), he or she commits adultery. Historically, states of the United States made adultery a crime by statute but, to the best of my knowledge, that is no longer the case. It is, however, prosecuted under the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice that prohibits conduct likely to bring discredit upon the armed forces, or conduct that is prejudicial to good order and discipline. Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch describe adultery as having sexual relations with another man''s wife, and do not consider that adultery occurs when a married man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman. Also, they define "adultery" in the usual way of limiting it to physical intercourse. NCLA : JMm JFm KMm KFm GMm GFm Return to main index Return

  commandment: We are not to engage in sexual intimacy outside of marriage.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Fornication is sexual intimacy (sexual contact of any kind) between a man and a woman who are not married to each other. One immediately notices that the definition is quite broad and encompasses adultery, prostitution, and having sexual relations with prohibited persons such as family members. Since these other categories are dealt with separately in this compilation, this Mitzvah on fornication will focus on what the Bible has to say about sexual intimacy between two unmarried persons where prostitution (conveyance of value for sex) is not involved. This kind of fornication sometimes occurs between individuals who intend to marry, in which case it is called "premarital sex," but it also occurs in casual dating. There are two things that make writing this Mitzvah on fornication a challenge. The first is that there is no Hebrew or Greek word in the Bible that means "fornication" and nothing else. The other is related to it; it is that different translators of the Bible
    have decided how and when to use the word "fornication," and some English translations (e.g. the NIV) opt to use other words and do not use the word "fornication" at all. For the above reasons, the approach to this subject I have chosen is to list and discuss Scriptures that use the word "fornication" regardless of the English translation from which they come. In all cases where fornication is mentioned in the English Bible, it either prohibits sex outside of marriage, or it is analogized to another activity with which God is displeased. This negative attitude toward (or prohibition of) sex apart from marriage is inferred by Scriptures in which a high value is put on a woman''s virginity. An example of such a Scripture is Leviticus 21:13 : "He [the High Priest] is to marry a virgin ..." Another example is Deuteronomy 22:28-29 : 1 If a man comes upon a girl who is a virgin but who is not engaged, and he grabs her and has sexual relations with her, and they are caught in the act, then
    the man who had intercourse with her must give to the girl''s father one-and-a-quarter pounds of silver shekels, and she will become his wife, because he humiliated her; he may not divorce her as long as he lives. The lesson learned from these Scriptures is that sex between a man and a woman outside of marriage is displeasing to God if not outright prohibited; nevertheless, the word "fornication" is not used. 1. See also, Deuteronomy 22:13-17 and Revelation 14:3-4 . Classical Commentators: Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch all wrote mitzvot prohibiting having sexual intercourse outside of marriage.

  commandment: We are not to participate in prostitution of any kind.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'The words "prostitutes" and "whore" are both found in the Bible, and are similar. A "whore" is a sexually loose woman, and a "prostitute" is a whore who sells her sexual favors for a price. Used in this way they are nouns, but both words can also be used as verbs. When they are used as verbs (e.g. to "whore" or to "prositute" one''s self) they are often not referring to sexual activity but rather to giving or selling oneself against society''s acceptable norms or God''s will (e.g. prostititing onself to the heathen gods). Whereas classically, the Mitzvah prohibiting prostitution alludes only to a man paying a woman to have sexual intercourse, this Mitzvah includes the wider prohibition mentioed above, which is most often exemplified by Israel selling herself through its sinful conduct. That is why the statement of this Mitzvah is "We are not to participate in prostitution of any kind or in any way ." Prostitution, by definition, has to have a price of sale, so what
    might men''s (or women''s) price or gain be for prostituting themselves? It varies from time to time, but it has typically been power, safety, economic advantage, or social acceptance. Here are some Scriptures that speak directly to the point without using the word "prostitute". It is subtle but, in each case, the prostituting offender gives something of himself in order to get something or achieve something in return. Proverbs 29:26 : Many seek the ruler''s favor, but it is from ADONAI that each gets justice . John 12:42-43 : Nevertheless, many of the leaders did trust in him; but because of the P''rushim they did not say so openly, out of fear of being banned from the synagogue; for they loved praise from other people more than praise from God . Galatians 1:10 : Now does that sound as if I were trying to win human approval? No! I want God''s approval! Or that I''m trying to cater to people? If I were still doing that, I would not be a servant of the Messiah . Classical Commentators:
    Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch wrote two mitzvot each that allude to prostitution. One of thtem relies on Leviticus 19:29 that prohibits making one''s daughter into a prostitute, but they express their mitzvot as not having sex outside of marriage. The other mitzvah that each wrote relies on Deuteronomy 23:19(18) and commands against bringing the financial fruits of prostitution into the Temple as an offering to the Lord.

  commandment: We are not to have sexual intercourse with a woman during her menstruation.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah applies to the conduct of both men and women. Under the Law of Moses, a woman (and all she touched) during her period of menstruation was ceremonially unclean. Although being ceremonially clean or unclean has little meaning today in the absence of the Tabernacle or Temple, I believe that this Mitzvah not to have sexual relations during a woman''s period should be obeyed and the reason is twofold. First, a woman cannot become pregnant during her menses, and a prime purpose for sexual intercourse is to bear children. Second (which I believe is the better reason), all through the Bible, blood is very special to God, and Leviticus 20:18 says that if a woman and a man have sexual relations during her period: he has exposed the source of her blood, and she has exposed the source of her blood; both of them are to be cut off from their people. We see that in the importance of blood sacrifice, and in the prohibition of our eating blood. Leviticus 17:11-14 states:
    For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for yourselves; for it is the blood that makes atonement because of the life. This is why I told the people of Isra''el, "None of you is to eat blood, nor is any foreigner living with you to eat blood." When someone from the community of Isra''el or one of the foreigners living with you hunts and catches game, whether animal or bird that may be eaten, he is to pour out its blood and cover it with earth. For the life of every creature - its blood is its life. Therefore I said to the people of Isra''el, "You are not to eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it will be cut off." I do not believe that the similar penalty of being "cut off" for eating blood and for having sexual intercourse with a woman during her period of blood is coincidental.

    having sexual relations with a woman during her menstruation. NCLA : JMm JFm KMm KFm GMm GFm Return to main index Return to main index'

  commandment: We are not to have give ourselves to unlawful sexual desires.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: 'Merriam-Webster defines sexual "lust" as "an unusually intense or unbridled sexual desire." Since the Bible unambiguously says that "lust" is sin, Merriam-Webster''s first alternative ("an unusually intense sexual desire") cannot be the one meant because mere feelings, no matter how strong, are never sin. The second definition ("an unbridled sexual desire") is closer to what is meant, the inclusion of "unbridled" making the difference. Restated, the sexual sin of lust comprises the prurient desire for a person that is not our spouse, coupled with one or more wrongful actions designed to gratify the desire; ergo, the title of this Mitzvah: "Giving Ourselves to Unlawful Sexual Desires." The reason that Yeshua (in Matthew 5:28 ) was able to say that "a man who even looks at a woman with the purpose of lusting after her has already committed adultery in his heart," is that the man he is speaking of is not only feeling sexual desire for the woman, but has already begun
    to pursue her either in his mind or by his actions. With this understanding, David''s adultery with Bat-Sheva did not begin when they had sexual intercourse; it began when David sent his messengers to fetch her ( 2 Samuel 11:1-4 ).'

  commentary_juster: 'Lust includes allowing one''s imagination to entertain sexually immoral thoughts without immediately renouncing them and refocusing. It includes masturbating while entertaining thoughts of a person who is prohibited to us, as well as any other act designed to gratify our desire.

  commandment: We are to study, listen to and teach Torah and Torah-obedience.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'While the Scriptures cited here speak to all of the Mitzvah''s elements, the two that are primary are Deuteronomy 6:6-7 , which is part of the Sh''ma (the Scripture-prayer that is recited by Orthodox Jews several times a day), and Jeremiah 31:30-33(31-34) (re-affirmed in Hebrews 8:10-11 ), the prophecy that God would give Israel a New Covenant, the essence of which would be God''s Word ( Torah ) embedded in hearts and minds so that all could know Him intimately. That prophecy was fulfilled by Yeshua who, according to John 1:1-14 , is God''s Word made flesh, and we know from other Scriptures that, after coming to earth, Yeshua offered Himself up as a sacrifice for our sin, was resurrected from the dead, and later returned to the Father, sending back to us the Ruach Hakodesh to reside within all who are willing to receive Him. The prophecy of Jeremiah was thus fulfilled, and we who are living today and believe, are its beneficiaries. The Scriptures cited do not use the
    word "study", but do say "on His Torah they meditate day and night", and "meditate on it all day". Also, the Bereans are said to have engaged in "checking the Tanakh every day", all of which are tantamount to studying God''s Word, but even exceed mere study because they connote repetition. According to Jeremiah 31:32(33) and Hebrews 8:10 , God puts His words within us but, just as with other blessings of God, He doesn''t force Himself on us; we have to invite Him. Therefore, we have a responsibility to receive and internalize God''s Word or we will derive no benefit from it. Internalizing God''s Word is the same as allowing the Ruach HaKodesh to live within us, to counsel, comfort, and yes, even convict us of sin should we stumble. Although Jeremiah spoke his prophecy to the Jewish people, God''s words for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest did not mean just Jews, but Gentiles also ( Romans 2:14-15a ) who, by confessing Yeshua, are grafted into an olive tree among
    Jewish branches ( Romans 11:17 ), thereby becoming members in the " national life of Isra''el " 1 or " commonwealth of Israel ", 2 ( Ephesians 2:12 ) and, consequently, in the wider body of believers. Deuteronomy 6:7 commands us to talk about God''s words (meaning His words in Scripture), and it mentions four occasions in particular, which I interpret to mean on all occasions. Speaking God''s words has the benefit of learning them, remembering them, and teaching them even to those who hear them spoken in passing. NormatTextParagraph Teaching Torah and Torah -obedience is commanded ( Matthew 5:19 ), and is expected of all of us. The Mitzvah as it applies to our children is especially important, however, because teaching children is the way our heritage of belief, obedience, and relationship with God is passed from generation to generation. As Proverbs 22:6 tells us: even when old, he will not swerve from it. 1. Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) translation 2. New King James Version (NKJ) translation'
  classical_commentators: 'Maimonides, Meir and HaChinuch wrote their respective mitzvot in fairly literal ways. Maimonides'' #RP11 speaks of studying the Torah , while Meir''s #MP14 and HaChinuch''s #C419 emphasize learning and teaching. Maimonides'' #RP10 specifies that we are to read the Sh''ma twice daily, morning and evening, and Meir''s #MP11 says similarly that we are to recite it. HaChinuch''s #C420 says something quite different; he says that we are only required to recite one verse of the Torah , namely Deuteronomy 6:4 . I am of the opinion that the Orthodox interpretation of reading or reciting the Sh''ma morning and evening is not what the Scripture intends, but the practice is a good one and a valid implementation so long as the Scripture''s higher and more far-reaching message is understood and pursued.'

  commandment: We are to remember and be continually aware of God's Word.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah combines several commandments, each employing a physical object to remind the Israelites of the commandments of God, and His having brought us out of Egypt. There are four kinds of these reminders: (a) something worn on the hand; (b) something worn on the forehead; (c) something affixed to the doorpost and gates of one''s house; and (d) tzitziyot 1 containing a blue thread worn on the clothing. The Orthodox position and that of the classical commentators is that each of these is intended by God to be done literally, but some argue that they are metaphoric. I am inclined to view binding to the hand and forehead as metaphoric and placing on the doorposts of houses as literal, but they are found in adjacent verses of Scripture and, by normal principles of exegesis, the three of them should therefore be viewed all one way or all the other. On the other hand, I cannot say that the three of them are metaphoric and that wearing t''fillin is a misapplication of
    Scripture because, in Matthew 23:5 , Yeshua criticizes the Pharisees for how they construct and wear their t''fillin , but He does not admonish the Pharisees for wearing them. Nevertheless, an argument for believing that binding to the hand and forehead is not meant to be literal is that the expression "as a sign on your hand and as a reminder between your eyes" is found in Scripture as a sign of several different things. Deuteronomy 6:4-9 appears to be saying that God''s commandments are a sign, Exodus 13:5-10 appears to be saying that matzah is a sign, and Exodus 13:11-16 appears to be saying that redeeming the firstborn is a sign. Wearing tzitziyot containing a thread of blue is clearly intended to be literal because of its specificity, and its consistency with the simple four-cornered style of garments worn during the time of Moses; also, Yeshua apparently wore them ( Matthew 9:20, 14:36 ; Luke 8:44 ). The question that modern Jews must answer for themselves is whether God intends
    tzitziyot to be worn today when the type and style of clothing is not as before. In Orthodox Jewish communities all men wear tzitziyot , and there is discussion about whether they are also appropriate for women to wear, but women normally do not wear them. In communities that have not adopted a position on the wearing of tzitziyot , each individual must make his own decision about whether to wear them as described in Scripture or to substitute some other article of clothing or accessory that will accomplish the same thing - reminding anyone seeing them of the commandments of God. What fringes are is self-evident, so the remaining decisions (other than whether to wear them at all) are what to construct them of, whether and how to knot them, what the color and origin of the blue dye for the thread should be, and what articles of clothing to attach them to. Since the only requirement in Scripture is that they be placed on the corners of garments, unless one''s community defines the particulars
    of acceptable tzitziyot , the wearer can use his own judgment on all of these. The orthodox Jewish community has adopted detailed rules for manufacturing tzitziyot which their male members wear under their shirts or vests and attached to a special four-cornered garment called a tallit katan . Tzitziyot are also worn on the traditional rectangular prayer shawl, the tallit gadol . The way to make and use t''fillin is not defined in Scripture, so one who chooses to wear them either adopts the Orthodox construction and usage, or exercises individual creativity. One contemporary kind of t''fillin I have seen consisted of a cloth bracelet and headband, both embroidered with words from Scripture; the bracelets were worn the entire day, and the headband only during prayer. The same latitude exists for making and placing m''zuzot . I have seen them made from tubes of diverse materials containing hand-written parchments or pieces of paper, and also made in the form of wood and ceramic plaques
    on which were engraved words of Scripture. It is important not to get so involved in the details of these "reminders" that we forget what they are supposed to remind us of, which are the commandments of God. We are not only to be reminded by them, but to be made continually aware of God''s Word as we proceed through each day. This is the sense I receive from (1) the Numbers 15 Scripture that speaks of not going around after where our own hearts and eyes lead us, and from (2) the Deuteronomy 6 Scripture that speaks of talking about God''s words as we walk by the way. These commandments were given to the Israelites thousands of years ago, and those who heard them directly from Moses no doubt knew exactly what God meant; if they didn''t, they could simply have asked Moses for clarification. We are living in an age where many things have changed - clothing styles, home styles, life styles, work schedules, etc., and we do not have Moses with us to ask. We do, however, have God Himself with
    us and in us in the person of the Ruach HaKodesh , so it is to Him that each of us should appeal for clarification. I came to my own conviction about wearing tzitziyot in this very way. Because I understood the principle behind wearing them, I considered wearing a necklace of the tablets of the Torah instead, reasoning that they too would remind me and others of the Word of God. However, after praying for guidance, the guidance I received from God was that He wanted me to wear tzitziyot because His plans for me (as well as for other Jews), made it important that I be perceived as a Messianic Jew who respected the community''s traditions. I recommend this "New Covenant" approach of seeking guidance from the Ruach HaKodesh for not only these matters, but for all of life''s questions; God''s Ruach was made available to us for that very purpose. In summary, I lean toward believing that the commandment to place God''s words on our hands and, foreheads are meant as metaphors to impress on
    us that God''s Word must form what we do and what we think. I cannot say so for sure, however, because of the Matthew 23:5 Scripture I mentioned earlier. I can go either way regarding m''zuzot , but it is clear to me that the commandment to wear tzitziyot is meant to be literal (see the Scriptures indicating that Yeshua wore them), but that God may allow substitutions on an individual basis. That notwithstanding, I consider the traditional literal ways of observance to be valid implementations of the Scriptures so long as their broader message is understood and pursued. One likely case for God allowing or even desiring substitution in all of these may be for Gentiles living among Jews. The principles are applicable to Gentiles, but the traditional ways of observing the commandments have become almost completely associated with being Jewish. Another case for substitution would be for women, for whom the commandments are also applicable, but the traditional ways of observing them have
    become almost completely associated with being male. 1. ''fringes'''

  commandment: We are to remember & proclaim Yeshua's sacrificial death by our partaking of bread and wine.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'Seudat HaAdon (a/k/a Shulchan HaAdon ) is known by a variety of names in English as well; "Meal of the Lord", "Table of the Lord", "The Lord''s Supper", and "Holy Communion" are common. There is a mystery surrounding Seudat HaAdon because Yeshua spoke of his body and blood in present tense - i.e. "this is my body"; "this is my blood"; rather than his saying: "this represents my body"; "this represents my blood." Also, in his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul says of Yeshua: " whoever eats the Lord''s bread or drinks the Lord''s cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of desecrating the body and blood of the Lord! " - again identifying the bread and wine with his body and blood in more than a symbolic way. These sayings of Yeshua have led the Roman Catholics to their doctrine of "transmutation", whereby they believe that the bread and wine taken in remembrance of Yeshua physically becomes his body and blood. While Messianic Judaism does not accept that the bread
    and wine of Yeshua physically transmutes, we do sense that when we take the elements of bread and wine, something of a spiritual nature occurs that is empowering and beyond mere symbolism. There is another controversy surrounding Seudat HaAdon , and that is when and how often it should be taken, and whether or not Yeshua intended it to be a sacrament as distinguished from a remembrance that occurs in the ordinary course of eating bread and drinking wine. Some say it is sacramental and should only be taken during the Passover seder meal since historically, that is the context in which Yeshua gave it to his disciples. Some say it is sacramental but can and should be taken on other occasions as well. Others say it is not sacramental, and that on every occasion in which we eat bread and drink wine we should declare it in remembrance of Yeshua. It is not my purpose here to prove or attempt to disprove any of these theories, but my own position is that Seudat HaAdon is intended as a sacrament
    to be taken during the Passover seder meal especially, and periodically at other times throughout the year as well. I do not believe that how often we take it is critical.'

  commandment: We are to abide in (stay united with) Yeshua in order to bear fruit.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'It is not possible for a man to bear no fruit at all. By merely being alive, man will bear either good fruit or bad fruit, and Scripture makes it plain that the choice is ours. Only good fruit results from our abiding in (being united with) Yeshua, and he is quoted to have said: " apart from me you can''t do a thing. " That is not to say that isolated instances of good fruit can never come from a person who is not united with Yeshua or that God cannot work His will through an unbeliever. However, Scripture is exhorting us that if we want to bear good fruit for God we must be (and remain) united with Yeshua, and then (and only then) will good fruit from us be assured.'

  commandment: We are to trust in Yeshua and believe that He is our Messiah sent by God.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'The various Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah speak of trusting him, and others speak of believing in him; both infer having faith in him and in his Father in heaven who sent him. It is important to understand that the kind of faith to which we are called is not mere intellectual belief for we read in James 2:19 : You believe that "God is one"? Good for you! The demons believe it too - the thought makes them shudder with fear! Our belief must be more than cognitive - it must be a full embracing of Yeshua as our Lord and Messiah - no less than what is stated in Romans 1:8-9 : What, then, does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart." - that is, the word about trust which we proclaim, namely, that if you acknowledge publicly with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and trust in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be delivered. Although pursuing eternal life (salvation) is not commanded, it is a clear benefit and result of trusting
    and believing in Yeshua.'

  commandment: We are to expect and accept that we will be persecuted on account of our faith in Yeshua.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah refer to attitudes violently hostile to Yeshua that existed in the synagogues of First Century Jerusalem. That notwithstanding, Yeshua's warnings are prophetic, and we see their fulfillment even today. The attitudes of most synagogues are still hostile to Yeshua, and although Jewish believers are no longer in mortal danger from them, persecution through ostracization is still very real. There are, however, many countries in the modern world where believers in Yeshua (both Jews and Gentiles) are not safe due to their faith, and where Jews are not safe merely for being Jews. We are warned to flee if we can, but we are not to seek protection through denying Yeshua.

  commentary_rudolph: Fear of men's disapproval is a primary motive when believers deny Yeshua, and when unbelievers refuse to consider him. Those feared may be family members, employers, co-workers, friends, or even fictitious figments of the imagination. Scripture is clear that whether one is a believer or an unbeliever, denying the true and full identity of Yeshua (Messiah, son of God, fullness of the deity, etc.) is sin, 1 and can have disastrous consequences. 1.

  commandment: We are to follow Yeshua and put him before all else.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: 'For Yeshua to say that to follow him we must leave our homes and members of our family seems unreasonably extreme until we understand what he means. It is disclosed in Luke 18:22 in which Yeshua tells the young leader: There is one thing you still lack. Sell whatever you have, distribute the proceeds to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come, follow me! Verse 23 that follows tells the story: But when the man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich. For him giving up wealth was a requirement because he was enamored of his holdings to the extent that he gave it precedence over following Yeshua. For many of us, money may not be the hindrance; what each of us must give up or walk away from will be according to our own idolatries and excessive affections. What Yeshua is calling us to do, is to divest ourselves of everything and everyone that we care about more than we care about him. Were Yeshua a mere mortal, his insistence on this would
    be akin to human slavery and sinful. But Yeshua is not a mere mortal; " in him, bodily, lives the fullness of all that God is " ( Colossians 2:9 ), and he is God''s son. Although pursuing eternal life (salvation) is not commanded, it is the clear benefit and result of following Yeshua.'

  commandment: We are to acknowledge God as our Supreme father, and Yeshua as our supreme rabbi, teacher, and leader.
  commandment_type: Positive
  commentary_rudolph: The Greek words used in Matthew 23:8-10 are for rabbi, for father, for teacher or leader. Since other Scriptures refer to our earthly fathers, teachers, and leaders, and since John does not object to being called "rabbi" in John 3:26 , Yeshua cannot be saying that we should not appropriately acknowledge our earthly fathers, teachers, leaders, and ordained rabbis. He is instead saying that we are to acknowledge our Father in heaven as our supreme father, and only him (Yeshua) as our supreme rabbi, teacher, & leader. The context is Yeshua criticizing Torah -teachers and the P'rushim who are using titles to elevate their stature, and doing things in public in order to be seen. This is a warning to us as well, to neither elevate our positions higher than we ought, nor approve or affirm others who may seek to do the same.
  classical_commentators: This Mitzvah is not addressed by any of the Jewish classical commentators.
  commentary_juster: Yeshua is warning us against gaining our identities through titles or other means that give an idolatrous level of honor to human beings.

  commandment: We are not to be beguiled by end-time false prophets & Messiahs.
  commandment_type: Negative
  commentary_rudolph: We were warned against false prophets from times of antiquity, but false Messiahs are a phenomenon of the New Covenant. Since the First Century, Judaism has experienced a number of persons (mostly obscure) who either claimed Messiahship or were regarded as Messiah by others. Three stand out as prominent, however; they are Simon bar Kokhba of the 2 nd Century, Sabbatai Zevi of the 17 th Century, and Menachem Mendel Schneerson of the 20 th Century. According to Scripture there are more to come, and Yeshua was emphatic in his warning against them. How do we know a false Messiah from the genuine? Simple! He is not Yeshua. How do we know a false end-time prophet from the genuine? Simple! He leads us away from Yeshua and the truths of Scripture.
