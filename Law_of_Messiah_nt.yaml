  commandment: We are to aspire to godliness and holiness.
  commentary_rudolph: Godliness and holiness are intricately connected. “Godliness” means being God-like in character and deed, and “holiness” means being set apart for God.

  title: Behaving Properly.
  commandment: We are to behave properly.
  commentary_rudolph: Behaving properly is a general Mitzvah that encompasses all of God’s commandments and the Holy Spirit’s spoken directions. They go together because the Holy Spirit guides us in acting appropriately and with the right timing in each situation. He also guides our behavior when the Torah is not explicit as to how we should respond.

  commandment: We are to pursue righteousness and live righteously.
  commentary_rudolph: Righteousness is not only being factually right; it is being right in moral attitude, in acting in accord with divine law, and in being in right relationship with God. Matthew 6:33 exhorts us to not only seek God’s Kingdom, but to seek it “first.” It is a reference to man’s tendency to be self-seeking in his quest for provisions. God promises us that if we make him our priority, we need not worry about providing for ourselves because He will meet all our needs.

  title: Seeking to Be Both Inwardly & Outwardly Clean.
  commandment: We are to seek to be both inwardly and outwardly clean.
  commentary_rudolph: Scripture uses “clean” and “unclean” in several ways – health-related, food-related, ceremony- related, and spiritually. Persons afflicted with sores (especially sores of leprosy) were deemed “unclean,” as were people with bodily discharges and women during menses and after childbirth. Also, certain animals were declared unclean, and people and objects touching something unclean (e.g. a human carcass) could render unclean the object or person who did the touching. All matters of cleanness (including hygienic) had ceremonial consequences in the Mosaic Covenant, especially regarding access to the Sanctuary and the performance of priestly functions. While being “clean” or “unclean” during the Mosaic Covenant had distinct spiritual implications, the New Covenant Scriptures emphasize the spiritual – especially regarding the condition of one’s heart, to holiness, righteousness, godliness, purity, and sin.

Our means of doing it are to (1) familiarize ourselves with the Scriptures, (2) seek to obey the Mitzvot ( Torah) of Scripture, and (3) listen for and obey the voice of God, spoken through the Holy Spirit, as He directs our path in Torah’s observance and application.

  title: Keeping Our Minds from Causing Our Bodies to Sin.
  commandment: We are to keep our minds from causing our bodies to sin.
  commentary_rudolph: God gave us our minds, bodies, and emotions, and they can cause us to sin if we allow them. On the other hand, Scripture tells us that we who are born again have the mind of Messiah and can therefore bring our minds under control to not only keep our thoughts pure, but also to keep our bodies from sinning in response to our emotions. We cannot control our feelings and emotions directly, but emotions unaccompanied by sinful actions are not themselves sins. If we exercise control of our minds to control our bodies’ responses and actions, our feelings and emotions will follow suit and be brought under control as well. It is a protective mechanism given us by God, but it requires that we engage our will to not sin.

  title: Seeking God’s Kingdom.
  commandment: We are to seek the Kingdom of God.
  commentary_rudolph: The term “Kingdom of God” (in the NKJ) occurs throughout the New Testament, whereas “Kingdom of Heaven” occurs only in the Book of Matthew. Some make a distinction between them, but I do not because, in my view, God’s Kingdom is everywhere that God is. God the Father resides in Heaven and now (in the New Covenant) the Holy Spirit resides on earth – within “born-again” believers. It is therefore logical that God’s Kingdom is in both places as well. The commandment to “seek God’s Kingdom” is understood by some to mean merely that we should seek salvation – eternal life with God. That is correct, but its meaning is broader; it is to seek to be with God always – on earth during our lives, and in Heaven when we pass on. And it is not only to be with God (ie. in God’s presence), but to have a personal father/son/daughter relationship with Him wherever we are. One more thing. Matthew 6:33 exhorts us to not only to seek God’s Kingdom, but to seek it “first.” It is a reference to man’s tendency to be self-seeking in his quest for provisions. God promises us that if we make Him our priority we need not worry about providing for ourselves because He will meet all our needs.

  title: Guarding Ourselves Against Greed.
  commandment: We are to guard ourselves against greed.
  commentary_rudolph: Greed is a selfish desire or yearning to acquire something that is either more than one’s needs or that one is not entitled to own. It is a character flaw that sometimes surfaces when one notices something his neighbor has that he does not. When his thoughts go to taking it from his neighbor, we call it coveting.

  title: Having Godly Compassion.
  commandment: We are to have godly compassion.
  commentary_rudolph: Compassion, mercy, love, and forgiveness are closely related. Compassion is a deep empathetic feeling for another’s difficulties, while mercy refers to actions taken in response to feelings of compassion. It is technically possible to show mercy without having compassion, and to be compassionate while withholding mercy. That notwithstanding, God calls us to both, and they are listed as separate Mitzvot in this compilation. In the Tanakh, except for the two Scriptures noted above, Scriptures on compassion and mercy are God’s toward us, and not our compassion and mercy toward others.

  title: Renouncing Worldly Pleasures.
  commandment: We are to renounce worldly pleasures that compete with our godly responsibilities.
  commentary_rudolph: Notice that Titus 2:11-12 speaks of renouncing godlessness and worldly pleasures as being connected. The word “worldly” and the often-used expression “of the world” does not mean all things in the world, but rather those things in the world that are not of God. There have been religious groups that have mistakenly eschewed all pleasure as being ungodly, but that is not the teaching of Scripture (e.g. Neh 8:10 ; Psalms 16:8-9, 11; Isa 3:10 ; Jer 31:6 ; Rom 15:24) . There are also several references to enjoyment and pleasure in Ecclesiastes , but one must be cautious in their interpretation because some are describing error and are therefore not meant to be taken as literal truth.

  commandment: We are not to be contaminated by the world and worldly standards.

We cannot be contaminated by the world and its standards if we do not accede to the temptations they present nor allow them to influence us. Of course, we must recognize when a standard we encounter is not of God, and we do that through our study of the Holy Scriptures.

  title: Fleeing from Sin & Evil.
  commandment: We are to flee from sin and evil.
  commentary_rudolph: Even after being reborn in our spirit, we are vulnerable to Satanic temptations.  If we see them coming, we need to flee. If they should find us, we know to deal with them through the power of the Holy Spirit, but we should not put our spiritual strength to the test by intentionally being where evil is rampant, and temptations abound.

  title: Being Patient.
  commandment: We are to cultivate & exhibit patience.
  commentary_rudolph: Patience, as a fruit of the Spirit, is from God. However, as with most things given us by God, we must take hold of it or it has no value. Being patient is a Mitzvah that wars against our flesh that wants immediate gratification of the things we desire. The virtue of having patience is our willingness to exercise faith for what we want and to wait upon God for his timing.

  title: Keeping Free from, and Purifying Ourselves from Things
  commandment: We are to keep free from, and purify ourselves from, things that defile.
  commentary_rudolph: People and things can be defiled. When something is defiled, it is made impure or unclean, and therefore unsuitable for its intended use. In Scripture, its meaning is to make a thing or a person unclean and unholy, i.e., unsuitable for ministry or for entering the Tabernacle (later the Temple). In Scripture, the defilement of a person occurs when a person either sins or comes into contact with an unclean or prohibited object or substance. There are, however, exceptions. In the Mosaic Covenant, a woman was made unclean for a short time after giving birth – presumably due to its association with blood and the temporary unhealed condition of her body. She was not, however, referred to as defiled. Similarly, a person with bodily sores was considered unclean but not defiled. For purposes of this Mitzvah (and in the New Covenant), defilement is understood to be the result of sin. We are therefore commanded not to sin in the first place, to repent when we do, and to keep away from people, things, and situations that would tempt us to spiritual uncleanliness.

  commandment: We are not to contemplate how to satisfy sinful desires.
  commentary_rudolph: We are commanded to flee from what is evil and sinful; that means in our thoughts, deeds, and environment. If we contemplate how to gratify our sinful desires, we are doing the opposite of fleeing and are therefore committing sin in our heart even if we do not do that which we contemplate.

  title: Not Calling Wrong & Bad That Which Is Right & Good.
  commandment: We are not to call wrong and bad that which is right and good.
  commentary_rudolph: An example of calling “wrong and bad” that which is right and good might be claiming that it is wrong and bad for a woman to identify as female (right and good) because it diminishes her importance. Another might be claiming that it is wrong and bad for married couples to have children (right and good) because having children increases the world’s population and puts a burden on its resources. The opposite, calling “right and good” that which is “wrong and bad” is what is often called justification. The opposite (calling right and good claiming that it is right and good for a man to divorce his wife to marry another woman with whom he has fallen in love because God commands husbands to love their wives. The opposite (claiming what is right and good to be wrong and bad) is similarly evil.

  title: Replacing Our Old Nature with a New Nature.
  commandment: We are to replace our old nature with a new nature given us by the Holy Spirit.
  commentary_rudolph: When we willfully receive Yeshua as our Lord and Messiah, we are said to be “born again” because we become new creations in our spirit. Our old nature (our old spirit) is replaced by a new nature (a new spirit), and this is done through the Holy Spirit. There are three spirits involved and they should not be confused. The first two (the old and new spirits) are our human spirits and the Holy Spirit is, of course, God’s Spirit. There is another kind of spiritual transaction with which this should not be confused, and that is the “immersion (baptism) of the Holy Spirit. That is when the Holy Spirit indwells us alongside our human spirit. It is often experienced as a second spiritual event that enhances (does not initially give us) our new spiritual nature.

  title: Persevering, Standing Firm, & Growing in Our Faith.
  commandment: We are to persevere, stand firm, & grow in our faith.
  commentary_rudolph: “Persevering” means continuing in a course of action in the face of difficulty, and “faith” is defined in Hebrews 11:1 of the CJB as “being confident of what we hope for, convinced about things we do not see.” The difficulty about faith that requires perseverance is that being sure of something without seeing it is contrary to our unaided human instinct. We are also told to stand firm in our faith, and that is because we tend to slip back from faith even having achieved it, if the goal for which we are believing is not realized in a relatively short time. Finally, we are called to grow in our faith, and that is achieved through practice in much the same way as athletes train their bodies. The more often we rely on faith, the easier it becomes to achieve it and maintain it.

  commandment: We are to be gentle to all whom we encounter.
  commentary_rudolph: Being gentle is not just being nice. Gentleness is a godly trait that shows care and respect for others while withholding one’s own power and ability to be harsh in one’s dealings. It requires humility in deferring vexing and contentious matters to God instead of taking matters into one’s own hands.

  title: Not Being Lukewarm in Our Faith.
  commandment: We are not to be lukewarm in our faith.
  commentary_rudolph: Faith involves hearing God, and absolutely believing Him for what one hears ( Romans 10:17 ). The reason that Revelation 3:15-16 speaks so negatively about “lukewarm” faith is that faith cannot be lukewarm. One either believes what he hears or does not; doubting God in the least is no faith at all, and “without faith it is impossible to please him” ( Hebrews 11:6 NKJ).

  commandment: We are to speak only that which is holy and beneficial.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah does not ascribe holiness of speech to just those verbal and written communications having explicit biblical content. There are several hundred thousand words in the English dictionary that, when linked as sentences, are easily in the millions if not billions. The easiest and best way therefore to determine if words spoken are holy and beneficial, is to determine whether they are the opposite – unholy and unbeneficial. Do they promote godly values or are they unbiblical and harmful?

  title: ''
  commandment: Ridding Ourselves of Unholy Characteristics.
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are many Scriptures in the Bible that identify individual unholy characteristics from which we must rid ourselves. Ephesians 4:31 and James 1:21 collectively list eight of them, but by the Apostle Paul referring to the “old nature” in Ephesisans 4:22, he is making it clear to those to whom he is speaking that they (and by inference we) are to rid themselves of not only those but all others as well. That is why this Mitzvah #AA23 is so broadly expressed; other Mitzvot in these volumes will address unholy characteristics individually.'

  title: Being Tenderhearted.
  commandment: We are to be tenderhearted toward our brother and neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: Being tenderhearted and being compassionate are similar. The subtle difference is that being tenderhearted is a continuous and independent condition, whereas being compassionate requires an external animate being for which or for whom to have compassion. One can therefore be tenderhearted in the absence of an external need but one cannot be compassionate without also being tenderhearted. In translations of the Bible, the terms appear to be interchangeable. One may ask how God can require us to be tenderhearted. Isn’t it a condition of our personality that is God-given or inherited? The answer is that tenderheartedness is a godly trait, the absence of which is the result of our fallen condition. When we willfully receive Yeshua the Messiah into our heart and make him Lord, we experience a rebirth of our spirit that softens our heart toward God, toward our fellow man, and toward God’s other created beings as well.

  commandment: We are to focus our thoughts on things that are godly.
  commentary_rudolph: Ungodly thoughts that are uninvited are not in themselves sinful, but intentionally holding on to such thoughts (e.g. for prurient reasons) is. To assist us in not falling into sin, Scripture lists for us godly thoughts upon which we are to focus, and ungodly thoughts we are to suppress.

  title: Not Touching That Which is Unclean.
  commandment: We are not to touch that which is unclean.
  commentary_rudolph: The words “Clean” and “unclean” in the Tanach typically refer to physical objects, animals, or people who have recently given birth, are unhealthy, or are dead. The one who touches any of these becomes ceremonially unclean for a defined period of time and is restricted as to what he or she can and cannot do. The words “Clean” and “unclean” in the New Testament have that meaning as well but have added to it being clean and unclean of heart and spirit. There is a saying derived from Scripture that we are to be in the world but not of the world. Its meaning is that while we live “in the world” and minister “in the world,” we are not to “touch” the spiritually unclean things of the world in a way that they will rub off on us and make us “of the world” as are they (see 1 Corinthians 5:9-10).

  title: Being Thankful and Grateful to God.
  commandment: We are to be thankful and grateful to God.
  commentary_rudolph: Being “thankful” and “grateful” are two of the most important ways that we relate to God. Translators of the Bible employ the two words (in their various forms) to indicate our profound appreciation of God’s provisions and blessings. There is a small definitional difference between the two words; being thankful is wholly cognitive, whereas being grateful adds a component of feeling. It is doubtful that the translators discern the difference so, when reading Scripture, we can consider the words to be synonymous.

  title: Being Joyful in All Circumstances.
  commandment: We are to be joyful in all circumstances.
  commentary_rudolph: 1 Thessalonians 5:16 admonishes us to “always be joyful.” But how can that be when there are times of hardship, pain and disappointment in most everyone’s life? The answer lies in the difference between being “joyful” and being “happy.” Happiness is a surface feeling of well- being that comes and goes with the ups and downs of life. Joy, in contrast, is a deep inner state of contentment that transcends the ups and downs of life. The reason that believers can have joy without ceasing is that God, who is always present, is the source of their joy (see Psalms 40:9(8) .

  title: Being Steadfast in Our Faith and Our Thinking.
  commandment: We are to be steadfast in our faith and our thinking.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Faith and trust in God as translated in the Scriptures are synonymous, and in Hebrews 11:1-3 we read: “Trusting [faith] is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about things we do not see. It was for this that Scripture attested the merit of the people of old. By trusting [faith], we understand that the universe was created through a spoken word of God, so that what is seen did not come into being out of existing phenomena.” Also, Romans 10:17 says of faith: “So trust [faith]comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through a word proclaimed about the Messiah.” (CJB) “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. (NKJ) The “hearing” referred to in Romans 10:17 is through the Holy Spirit, and it can come prophetically or through inspired revelation of Scripture. What is most important about faith is that it is the way through which we relate to God; that is why Hebrews 11:6 tells us: “And without trusting [having faith], it is impossible to be well pleasing to God,” Mitzvot in Volumes 1 & 2 G12 Having Faith in God & Trusting Him in All Things G19 Praying in Faith & Having Faith for That Which We Pray H04 Using Our Speech, Thoughts, Hearts and Actions for that which Is Good and Holy Y04 Expecting & Accepting Persecution on Account of Our Faith in Yeshua'

  title: Being Faithful, Trustworthy and Loyal.
  commandment: We are to be faithful, trustworthy, and loyal.
  commentary_rudolph: Faithfulness is the quality of being dependable in one’s attemp to carry out a task or duty. Trustworthiness is similar but includes assurance that the person one trusts will not veer from the given task through lack of wisdom or temptation and that the means he or she chooses to carry out the task will be the best or at least appropriate. Loyalty (also fidelity) is maintaining devoted attachment to a person, task or principle and the assurance that one cannot not be lured to another. Faithfulness, trustworthiness and loyalty are grouped herein into a single Mitzvah because a person cannot be one of them without also being the other two. Faithfulness, trustworthiness, and loyalty are virtues only so long as the people, entities, or principles to which they are applied are themselves virtuous or at least one believes them to be virtuous. Their application in the Bible and in this Mitzvah is to God, Yeshua, and to brother believers, and unless they are said to be otherwise, they are considered virtues in all biblical contexts.

  title: Guarding Against Hypocrites & Not Being a Hypocrite.
  commandment: We are to guard against hypocrites & not be a hypocrite.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Hypocrisy is advocating a standard or belief to which we ourselves do not adhere, or to which our behaviors do not conform. We sometimes hear that we should not preach to our brother to do that which we ourselves do not do because it is hypocritical. It is indeed hypocritical, but it is not a correct saying. The correct saying is revealed in Matthew 7:4-5 : “How can you say to your brother, ''Let me take the splinter out of your eye,'' when you have the log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye; then you will see clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother''s eye!” We should not hesitate to bring correction our brother when it is needed; however we should correct ourselves first so that our subsequent correction of our brother will not be hypocritical.'

  title: Keeping Our Promises.
  commandment: We are to keep our promises.
  commentary_rudolph: A vow is a solemn promise; an oath is also a promise, but one that invokes an authority such as a god, a king, or an entity of similar importance. Covenants are enforceable promises that are usually bilateral – i.e. exchanged between individuals. Covenants can also be unilateral and, when they are, they are usually accompanied by a sign or seal. Most references to promises in the Bible are about God keeping his promises to men and men to God. The New Testament has a few references to human beings keeping their promises to other human beings and the Tanakh has more, but they tend to be about specific obligations such as fidelity in commercial transactions. All of this notwithstanding, keeping promises is a godly virtue for which we are held accountable by both God and man. The covenant promise of fidelity in marriage is one of the most important.

  title: Not Harboring Selfish Ambition.
  commandment: We are not to harbor selfish ambition.
  commentary_rudolph: Ambition is the desire and motivation to achieve something; it is a godly trait if its goal and means of achieving it are themselves godly (e.g., Romans 15:20). Selfish ambition, on the other hand, is not godly and we are commanded against it. It is the sinful promotion of self-interest in disregard or at the expense of others. It typically begins with coveting something of interest or value that is possessed or owned by another, and then developing a desire and motivation to take it for one’s self.

  title: Not Blaspheming.
  commandment: We are not to blaspheme.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Blasphemy is speaking profanely, disrespectfully, irreverently or in an insulting manner about God or something sacred. Yeshua was accused of blasphemy by the Cohen haGadol in Matthew 26:64-65 when Yeshua identified with God and said: “But I tell you that one day you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of HaG''vurah and coming on the clouds of heaven." Also John 10:33 : “The Judeans replied, "We are not stoning you for any good deed, but for blasphemy- because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.” This Mitzvah includes not blaspheming against the Holy Spirit among other sacred entities. Nevertheless, blaspheming against the Holy Spirit is special because Matthew 12:31-32 tells us that it is the only blasphemy that is unforgiveable. It is therefore listed and dealt with separately in Mitzvah #AB12.'

  title: Not Swearing Oaths.
  commandment: We are not to swear oaths.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This is a particularly difficult Mitzvah to understand because the words of the Tanach seem to contradict those of the New Testament. Deuteronomy 10:20 states: “You are to fear ADONAI your God, serve him and swear by his name.” and Leviticus 19:12 states: “Do not swear by my name falsely,.” Both of these infer that swearing an oath is authorized so long as it is in God’s name and not sworn falsely. However, James 5:12, states: “Above all, brothers, stop swearing oaths- not "By heaven," not "By the earth," and not by any other formula;” which seems to preclude swearing oaths altogether. The issue is discussed more fully in Mitzvah #A9 in Volume #1 of this compilation but, since publishing that volume, I have come to believe that, among the various possible explanations, Dr. Daniel C. Juster’s opinion that follows is most likely correct, especially as to oaths required by public law.'
  commentary_juster: I am of the opinion that, in his "Sermon on the Mount," Yeshua preaches a higher standard for truth-telling and for verbalizing oaths than the one commonly practiced in his day; his exhortation is to return us to the standard that was always implied in the Torah . Yeshua is saying that our truthfulness as believers and our commitment to doing what we say we will do should have such integrity, that oaths become unnecessary among us. This would limit our oath-taking to public law contexts where it is required for testifying in court and for entering into certain contracts. As Yeshua-believers, we should become known for our trustworthiness.

  title: Fleeing Lustful Passions.
  commandment: We are to flee lustful passions.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is not advocating that we flee our lawful passions of having and enjoying sex as part of marriage. The “passions of youth” referred to in 2 Timothy 2:22 are sexual passions typical of those referred to in Matthew 5:2 – lusting after (and worse acquiring) sexual gratification out of wedlock and from people whose sexual favors belong to another (see the example of Joseph fleeing from Potiphar’s wife in Genesis 39:1-12) .

  commandment: We are not to treat as unclean that which God has made clean.
  commentary_rudolph: 'The voice from Heaven spoken to Peter in Acts 10:15 and Acts 11:9 was telling Peter that he could fellowship with Gentiles and eat in their homes because God had made them spiritually clean. It is not (as some believe) about eating unkosher animals. This Mitzvah #AA40 is especially important for the body of believers in Yeshua as it speaks to the cleanness of heart that results from our repenting of sin and receiving Yeshua’s sacrifice as our own. It is also important in uniting the Jews and Gentiles within the body of believers as being spiritually equal.'

  title: Comparing That Which is Taught Us to What We Read in
  commandment: We are to compare that which is taught us to what we read in Scripture.
  commentary_rudolph: We are to test everything we hear against Scripture. That means everything we hear from others and everything we think we are hearing from the Holy Spirit. This process of checking and comparing is what we call discernment, and it would be simple if the words of Scripture that were written centuries ago, and in contexts that no longer exist, were always easy to apply in today’s world and in our immediate circumstances. The fact is that we cannot be sure that we understand the Scriptures unless we seek and are sure that we are hearing the Holy Spirit’s interpretation. This puts us in a bind when what we are checking is whether we have heard the Holy Spirit correctly in the first place. The solution for this is not procedural – it is relational. We can only know that we are hearing the Holy Spirit correctly if we know the voice of the Holy Spirit (meaning God’s voice) well. If we do, then when we seek confirmation of something from the Scriptures, WE WILL KNOW WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW.

  title: Knowing & Doing What is Right & Good.
  commandment: We are to know & do what is right & good.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Whereas the term “works” is not used in the text of this Mitzvah , “works” is what we are usually addressing when talking about “doing right and good.” James 2:26 tells us that “faith without actions (works) is dead” and the “works” it is speaking of are, of course, “good” works. It is also not possible to distinguish between works that are right and those that are good. All of Torah and, in fact, all things godly, are both right and good. This Mitzvah is closely related to several others but especially to Mitzvah #DA12: “Being Good & Kind to One Another.” Actions that are good are often so because they are good to and for people, although some are good for animals, other aspects of God’s creation, and God Himself. It may seem presumptuous that we can do anything good for God, but we can by caring for His creation, and by connecting to Him through prayer and obedience.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'To understand this Mitzvah, one must first understand what has come to be known as the Abrahamic Covenant that is described in Genesis 17:1-16, highlights of which are: “When Avram was 99 years old ADONAI appeared to Avram and said to him, "I am El Shaddai [God Almighty]. Walk in my presence and be pure-hearted."” “As for me, this is my covenant with you: you will be the father of many nations. Your name will no longer be Avram [exalted father], but your name will be Avraham [father of many], because I have made you the father of many nations.” “I am establishing my covenant between me and you, along with your descendants after you, generation after generation, as an everlasting covenant, to be God for you and for your descendants after you.” "As for you, you are to keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you, generation after generation. Here is my covenant, which you are to keep, between me and you, along with your descendants after you: every male among you is to be circumcised. You are to be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; this will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. Generation after generation, every male among you who is eight days old is to be circumcised, including slaves born within your household and those bought from a foreigner not descended from you. The slave born in your house and the person bought with your money must be circumcised; thus my covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant. Any uncircumcised male who will not let himself be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin- that person will be cut off from his people, because he has broken my covenant." Covenants can be bilateral or unilateral. A bilateral covenant comes into existence when two parties agree to perform in some way. The covenant referred to above that was made with Abraham and his descendants (even those yet unborn) was not bilateral – it was unilateral. Abraham and his descendants (later called “Israelites” or “Jews”) could individually violate it by refusing circumcision, but there was nothing for them to promise or to do to bring it into existence. God simply gave it to them, and its purpose was to identify the children of Israel as a priestly servant-nation that all would see was obedient to God and through whom God could reach all the other nations of the world. The Hebrew for circumcision of the flesh is “b’rit milah” – literally “covenant cutting.” It is an act of commanded covenantal obedience and a visible witness to the Gentile nations of Israel’s relationship with God. There is, however, a higher kind of covenant circumcision to which circumcision of the flesh points; it is “circumcision of the heart,” and it too involves obedience – not out of command, but out of love. This kind of “covenant cutting” is not only for the Jew but also for the Gentile, and there is another difference. The covenant of “heart circumcision” is bilateral in that God offers it, and it only becomes a reality
    in the life of each individual that accepts it.'

  title: Not Doing Wrong in Order to Accomplish Something Good.
  commandment: We are not to do something wrong in order to accomplish something good.
  commentary_rudolph: Another way of expressing this Mitzvah is “Not justifying for the good, one’s conduct that is bad.” It is applying the opposite of Mitzvah AA17 “Not Calling Wrong & Bad That Which Is Right & Good.” The secular saying “The end justifies the means” is biblically indefensible because doing wrong is always wrong and sinful regardless of one’s motive.

  commandment: We are not to pursue righteousness through our own power.

  title: Not Giving Ourselves to Sensuality.
  commandment: We are not to give ourselves to sensuality.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is similar to Mitzvah #GB60 in that passions and emotions are related to and part of sensuality. Sensuality is the enjoyment, expression or pursuit of things to do with our senses, i.e. feelings – especially feelings of pleasure, often sexual. 2 Corinthians 5:7 (NKJ) tells us that we “walk by faith and not by sight.” The “sight” referred to is not just eyesight; it is anything our bodies see, hear, smell, taste, feel, or otherwise detect and react to from external sources. There is a level to which such perceptions are normal and God-given, such as seeing danger and turning aside or feeling the pain of something hot and avoiding being burned. Those are not the kinds of “sensuality” that we are to avoid and, in fact, not all sensuality is to be avoided. Sexual pleasure is sensual, and when experienced appropriately within marriage is good and healthy. What this Mitzvah speaks against is “giving ourselves” to sensuality – i.e. allowing sensuality to rule us. The Apostle Paul could very well have said in 2 Corinthians 5:7: “For we walk by faith, not by sensuality.”'

  title: Aspiring to Be Blameless.
  commandment: We are to aspire to be blameless.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah that is about being blameless is similar to the several Mitzvot listed above that direct us to be godly, holy, righteous, good, pure, decent, etc. In writing this volume we could have joined them into a single Mitzvah were it not for the fact that the Bible speaks of each separately. So, what is unique about being blameless, and how can Scripture direct us to aspire to blamelessness when at the same time Romans 3:22-32 tells us that “all have sinned and come short of earning God’s praise?” And how can David, the writer of Psalms 26:1 , tell God “I have lived a blameless life; unwaveringly” when the Bible reveals that he sinned by causing Uriah the Hittite’s death so he could continue his adulterous relationship with Uriah’s wife? These seeming inconsistencies can only be reconciled if being blameless is not synonymous with being sinless so, the question then becomes how can one say that one is (or has been) blameless after one has sinned? And how can one aspire to be blameless when it is almost certain that one will eventually sin? Some say that David wrote Psalms 26:1 before his sins involving Uriah and Bathsheba occurred. But David also wrote the following: Psalms 25:6-7 Remember your compassion and grace, ADONAI; for these are ages old. Don''t remember my youthful sins or transgressions; but remember me according to your grace for the sake of your goodness, ADONAI. Psalms 25:11 For the sake of your name, ADONAI, forgive my wickedness, great though it is. Psalms 25:18 See my affliction and suffering, and take all my sins away. Psalms 143:2 Don''t bring your servant to trial, since in your sight no one alive would be considered righteous. There can be only one answer; it is that when David repented of his sins he had prophetic incite and faith that God would somehow and one day “take all my sins away” ( Psalms 25:18) . We are in a much better position than David. If we, with faith in Yeshua repent of our sins, beg God for forgiveness, and receive Yeshua’s sacrifice as our own, we become as clean and blameless as if we had never sinned. Therefore, for us who are in the New Covenant, aspiring to be blameless is the same as aspiring to have faith in the cleansing blood of Yeshua.'

  title: Not Being Rebellious towards God’s Authority.
  commandment: We are not to rebel against God’s authority.
  commentary_rudolph: 'It is a surprise to some from reading 1 Samuel 15:23 to learn that “rebellion is like the sin of sorcery.” After all, the very founding of our country was achieved by rebelling against British rule, and we never thought of that as sinful. Later we learned from Romans 12:9 that we are to “recoil from what is evil,” which sounds very much like “rebelling” against evil, and that is certainly not sinful. The key to untangling what seem like contradictions is understanding that rebellion by itself is not sinful. Whether or not rebellion is sinful depends on what one is rebelling against. The context of 1 Samuel 15:2-23 is Sha’ul’s rebellion against God by rejecting His Word, and the context of 1 Timothy 1:9 is being “heedless of Torah ” and being “sinful, wicked and worldly” – hence the statement of this Mitzvah: “We are not to rebel against God’s authority.” Additional Comment by Daniel C. Juster Acts 5:29 tells us: “We must obey God, not men.” Consequently, we must rebel against human authority when it requires that we violate God’s law. The Revolutionary War was such a situation. The argument that was given at the time or the Revolution that the British were in rebellion against God’s natural laws is a hard sell in Britain even to this day.'

  title: Not Being Double-Minded.
  commandment: We are not to be double-minded.
  commentary_rudolph: 'According to James 1:7-8, a double-minded man (and of course woman) is “unstable in all his ways.” It is because a person who is double-minded is pulled in different directions by his thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and loyalties. One day he leans one way on an issue and the next day the other way. It is simplistic to tell someone “Don’t be double-minded,” but how does one achieve it? By pursuing the will of God instead of one’s own inclinations. Proverbs 14:12 teaches: “There can be a way which seems right to a person, but at its end are the ways of death,” and 2 Corinthians 5:7 (NKJ) instructs us to “walk by faith, not by sight.” A person who sets his life’s direction in obedience to Torah is never double minded.'

  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah calls us to keep control of our tongues by listening to others before expressing our own thoughts and opinions. Being willing to listen before speaking is a product of humility, shows respect for others, and can save us from speaking foolishly.

  title: Being Open to Reason.
  commandment: We are to be open to reason.
  commentary_rudolph: “Being open to reason” is another way of saying “being logical and being teachable.” We must, however, to be cautious of and reject assertions, prophecies, and teachings, that are logical and reasonable according to the world’s standards but not by God’s. Hence biblical knowledge and spiritual discernment must always accompany logic in determining what is reasonable.

It is similar to Mitzvah #55: “Not Being Double-Minded,” and is necessary for the fulfillment of Mitzvah #32: “Being Faithful, Trustworthy and Loyal.'

  title: Keeping a Clear Conscience.
  commandment: We are to keep a clear conscience.
  commentary_rudolph: Our conscience is that entity within us that tells us what is morally right and what is morally wrong. If it were not for the Bible and the Holy Spirit, our conscience would be at the whim and mercy of our fallen human nature. and what we are taught by our parents, our teachers, and the world in which we live. It is likely that some of what we are taught is right, but too often we are impacted by wrong teaching as well. This Mitzvah instructs us to keep a clear conscience, which means to align our conscience with what God says is right, an instruction that we could not follow were we ignorant of Scripture, and our conscience unable to hear and resonate with the Holy Spirit. Therein lies the key to complying with this Mitzvah ; it is to learn from the Bible, and hear and be obedient to the Holy Spirit.

  commandment: We are not to allow the emotion of anger to cause us to sin..
  commentary_rudolph: Ephesians 4:26 makes it clear that while anger (if unchecked) can open us to the Adversary (Satan) and the commission of sin, anger itself is not sinful. It also makes it clear that should we become angry for any reason, we can and must control it, and not permit it to cause us to sin.

  title: Hating Ungodly Vices.
  commandment: We are to hate ungodly vices.
  commentary_rudolph: There are two categories of human behavior that are commonly called vices. We may call the first of these “character vices;” they include arrogance, jealousy, unbridled anger, greed, etc. The second of these are “vices of commission” – chronic immoral, antisocial, or destructive acts that are looked down on or prohibited by Scripture or segments of society. They include habitual intoxication, drug addiction, prostitution, fornication, gluttony, unbridled spending, etc. All are sinful, but they are different from other sins in that they are not one-time or occasional occurrences; rather they are behaviors that are recurring. While all sins are to be hated, this Mitzvah only addresses ungodly “vices of commission.” Ungodly “character vices” are dealt with in other Mitzvot .

  title: Not Being Cowardly.
  commandment: We are not to be cowardly.
  commentary_rudolph: A person who is cowardly lacks expected courage to act in the face of danger. It is understood that being cowardly is not a favorable attribute, but why does Revelation 21:8 list it with sinners who are destined for destruction in the lake of fire? A possible answer (supported by 1 Thessalonians 2:2) is that the Scripture is referring to people who have the knowledge they need to receive and proclaim Yeshua as Messiah but withhold doing so because they fear retaliation. Such cowardice is akin to murder (the taking of life) because it deprives both themselves and others whom they would influence (were they to become believers) of the opportunity to have eternal life.

  commandment: We are to be slow in becoming angry.

  title: Not Testing or Tempting God, the Holy Spirit, or Yeshua.
  commandment: We are not to test or tempt God, the Holy Spirit, or Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'A question that is sometimes asked is: “What is the difference between ‘testing’ and tempting?’ The answer is that “tempting” is intentionally luring and desiring a person to do something he would not ordinarily do (e.g committing sin), while “testing” makes available to a person the opportunity to do something in order to find out whether he will do it. The two are connected when God tests us through trials ( James 1:2-4 & 12) or by allowing Satan (through our flesh) to tempt us ( James 1:13-14) . We also read in Genesis 3:1-6 of how Satan successfully tempted Eve, and in Matthew 4:1-11 of how he tried (unsuccessfully) to tempt Yeshua. But Scripture (as reflected in this Mitzvah ) commands us not to test God (including Yeshua and the Holy Spirit); why is it wrong to test God? It is wrong because God has revealed Himself and His will for us in Scripture; putting God to the test is therefore saying that we do not believe the Scriptures or that we do not believe God. Why do men sometimes test God? Mostly to determine the limits of sin they can commit without being punished. They typically do it by committing a sin they desire to commit and then wait for God to respond. If they receive no immediate response, they become emboldened, believing that they can repeat the sin with impunity. Note: An apparent exception is Malachi 3:10 in which God invites being tested: 3 “Bring the whole tenth into the storehouse, so that there will be food in my house, and put me to the test," says ADONAI-Tzva''ot. "See if I won''t open for you the floodgates of heaven and pour out for you a blessing far beyond your needs.”'

  title: Seeking Rest, Refreshment, & Renewal in Yeshua & the Holy
  commandment: We are to seek rest, refreshment, and renewal in Yeshua and the Holy Spirit.
  commentary_rudolph: 'The purpose of resting is to receive refreshment and renewal. Various Scriptures command us to rest from work weekly and annually on the various Sabbaths, and to rest our souls in God, Yeshua, and the Holy Spirit always. Because Yeshua and the Holy Spirit are echad with God the Father, this Mitzvah could well have had the title “Seeking Rest, Refreshment & Renewal in God.” However, because some Scriptures refer to Yeshua, some to the Holy Spirit, and some to God, the authors herein decided to focus this Mitzvah on Yeshua and the Holy Spirit, and to create a second Mitzvah #BA62 to discuss Scriptures that refer to God more broadly. “Rest,” “refreshment,” and “renewal” are related, but they are not the same and they can mean different things in different contexts. “Refreshment” means revitalization – giving fresh and renewed strength. It is a simple enough concept that applies to our bodies, souls, and spirits, so we will not discuss it further. “Rest” most commonly refers to the physical rest of our bodies that is needed for physiological “renewal.” The Scriptures that command we rest on the various Sabbaths include physical rest but point to a higher kind of rest and renewal as well – rest of our souls and spirits by surrendering ourselves to God and allowing Him to take our burdens and cares upon himself.'

  title: 'Abiding in the Vine: Being United (in Unity /Union) with God'
  commandment: We are to be united (in unity /union) with God and Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: Yeshua describes himself as the vine, and “abiding” in him is more than living alongside him; it is allowing our lives to be merged with his. Scripture describes it as being in “unity” with him,” being “unified with him,” and being “in union” with him – expressions that are used interchangeably by the Bible translators. When applied to our relationship with God (including Yeshua and the Holy Spirit), Scripture calls us to be so “at one” with Yeshua and therefore with God that our views are his views, and what we say and do are those things he would have us say and do. The ultimate is our being able to say that we are “in” him. It is interesting that there are a plethora of Scriptures in the New Testament that speak of mankind achieving intimacy with God, but there are relatively few in the Tanakh. The probable reason is that prior to the New Covenant, ordinary Israelites did not have the same level of access to the Holy Spirit (designated leaders such as Abraham, Moses, and David did of course) and it is the Holy Spirit that enables us to “abide in Yeshua” and be in close union with God. Note that in Psalms 51:13(11), David begs God not to cast him away by taking the Holy Spirit from him.

  title: Trusting (Having Faith /Believing) in God and Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to trust (have faith /believe) in God and Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Bible translations speak of “faith,” “trust,” and “believing” interchangeably. Hebrews 11:1 in the Complete Jewish Bible tells us that: “Trusting is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about things we do not see.” We are urged and commanded to trust (have faith) in God the Father and his son Yeshua in all things. There are three ways that we can deny belief and faith in God and Yeshua. The most obvious and direct is through words stating our unbelief. It is of course understandable if we truly do not believe but, except in unusual circumstances, is sinful for one who does. Why might a believer deliberately conceal his or her belief? Perhaps to avoid persecution or even death in a hostile circumstance but, even then, God would have to approve the denial for it not to be counted as sin. Another way that we can deny our belief and faith is through silence – i.e., allowing others to continue in their incorrect assumption that we do not believe when in fact we do. What was said previously applies to this scenario as well. There is a third way that we can deny belief and faith, and that is by calling ourselves believers while allowing our conduct to violate God’s Word and standards. This is the most egregious way; it marks us as hypocrites and worse, misrepresents the values for which God and Yeshua stand. 4'

  title: Not Denying Our Belief and Faith in God & Yeshua.
  commandment: We are not to deny our belief and faith in God & Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'If our understanding of this Mitzvah combined with Luke 9:23 and Romans 6:22 is merely literal, we will conclude that God expects us to have no self-concerns or desires other than to give ourselves to him. As with most biblical interpretation, we can miss the meaning if we do not consider the Bible as a whole. Being God’s “slave” (as Romans 6:22 puts it) is not what God wants our relationship with him to be. That is made clear in Psalms 37:4 : “Trust in ADONAI, and do good; settle in the land, and feed on faithfulness. Then you will delight yourself in ADONAI, and he will give you your heart''s desire.” Of course, our heart’s desire must be consistent with God’s moral values and his will for us and for mankind. Psalms 126:2, Proverbs 10:28 , Proverbs 17:22, and Ecclesiastes 9:7 illustrate more of the lighter side of God’s will for us. One may notice that, in comparison to the New Testament, there are relatively few references in the Tanakh to offering ourselves to God; the Tanakh’s references to offerings are mostly to alter sacrifices. Nevertheless, giving ourselves to God is taught throughout the Tanakh using expressions such as “presenting ourselves,” “worshipping,” “bowing down,” “being in union with,” “following,” “serving,” “dedicating,” and “obeying.”'

  title: Offering Our Entire Selves to God.
  commandment: We are to offer our entire selves to God.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Judaism takes its responsibility to praise God seriously, as demonstrated by our chanting or singing the “ Aleinu ” three times daily at the closing of the Shachrit, Mincha, and Ma’ariv services. The first two lines of the “ Aleinu ” prayer are: “(1) It is our duty to praise the Lord of all, (2) to ascribe greatness to Him who formed the world in the beginning.” 5 Since references to Yeshua are not included in traditional Jewish prayers, Messianic Judaism adds praises to Yeshua to the traditional liturgies. An example is a second line sometimes added to the Sh’ma : “(1) Here O Isra’el, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. (2) Yeshua, He is the Messiah, He is Lord of all.”'

  title: Praising God and Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to praise God & Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Faith, worship, thankfulness, and obedience are main components of our love relationship with God (and Yeshua), and we are called by Scripture to please God and Yeshua in all of these. To do so requires that we put God ahead of our own interests and those of other people. We cannot divide our loyalties and still please God; Galatians 1:10 teaches: Now does that sound as if I were trying to win human approval? No! I want God''s approval! Or that I''m trying to cater to people? If I were still doing that, I would not be a servant of the Messiah. We are often tempted to please men before God because in the natural we can see men whereas we cannot see God who is a spirit. That is why faith is needed and why Hebrews 11:6 in the NKJ version teaches: But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.'

  title: Pleasing God and Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to seek to please God and Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: Scripture teaches that God’s justice is fair and impartial; he shows no favoritism among his created children. Nevertheless, the particulars of Torah (God’s teaching) are sometimes applied differently according to who a person is – man or woman, parent or child, Jew or Gentile. For example, circumcision is required of all Jewish males ( Genesis 17:9-10 ) but is only required of certain Gentiles ( Genesis 17:12-13 ; Exodus 12:48) . Husbands are responsible for being the heads of their wives and not visa-versa ( Ephesians 5:22-23) . Recognizing such distinctions in the administration of justice is not being partial or unfair. Also, it is not being partial to hold people who are in positions of authority, or have greater knowledge, to a higher standard of accountability (e.g. Luke 12:47-48 and Hebrews 13:17) .

  title: Believing in God’s Evenhanded Justice.
  commandment: We are to believe in God’s evenhanded justice.
  commentary_rudolph: '(from Mitzvah #W8 of Volume 2) Christian theologians have often misinterpreted (and sometimes mistranslated) the Shaliach Paul’s writings to be saying that the mitzvot (commandments of the Torah ) – the laws – the statutes, ordinances, and judgments given at Mt. Sinai – were rendered uselessly obsolete by Yeshua. Those who hold that view teach that God’s law has been replaced by his grace, so that if we love God and one another, none of the specifics of the “Mosaic Law” matter anymore. 6 Such views are in direct contradiction of Yeshua’s words in Matthew 5:19 , which says: “So whoever disobeys the least of these mitzvot and teaches others to do so will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever obeys them and so teaches will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.” Also problematic, is the mistranslation (of Matthew 5:17 of many Bible versions) of the Greek word “πληρῶσαι,” that is commonly but incorrectly rendered “fulfill:” Scriptures often cited to support this view include Romans 6:14 and 2 Corinthians 12:9 . “Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.” (NKJ) The word in this context should actually be translated “fill” (the CJB translates it “complete”). These numerous mistranslations have fueled antinomians to teach that no part of God’s Law given at Mount Sinai is to be obeyed today because Yeshua fulfilled it in Himself. 7 There is another Scripture whose misunderstanding has caused no little amount of controversy, and that is Matthew 19:17, in which Yeshua tells a man: “But if you want to obtain eternal life, observe the mitzvot." Yeshua seems to be saying that salvation comes from a legalistic observance of the law, whereas we know from Galatians 2:16 (as well as other Scriptures) that: “.. a person is not declared righteous by God on the ground of his legalistic observance of Torah commands, but through the Messiah Yeshua''s trusting faithfulness.” The answer to this seeming contradiction is, of course, that Deuteronomy 18:15-19 of the Mosaic Torah prophesies the coming of Messiah Yeshua, and commands us to listen to him and obey him, as he will be speaking in God’s Name. So, to obey the Torah, is also to receive and obey the Mitzvot of Yeshua. A final word: This Mitzvah rests on my (and Daniel Juster’s) belief in the continued efficacy of all the Scriptures of the Torah ( 2 Timothy 3:16-17) , recognizing that we have to be led by the Ruach Hakodesh for their application in this New Covenant age. 8'

  commandment: We are to obey the commandments of God and Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Mitzvah #BA12 commands us to lift Yeshua up! While honoring and lifting up are similar, the two are not precisely the same. Lifting a person up could mean giving him prominence or raising his mood or spirit, while honoring a person is acting in such a way as to acknowledge his or her value, importance, greatness, or authority. When Scripture calls us to lift God and Yeshua up, we are not only to raise them to prominence, but to do so with honor. That having been said, we can honor God and Yeshua in private as well by worshipping them, praising them, and obeying them.'

  title: Honoring God & Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to honor God and Yeshua..
  commentary_rudolph: 'Mitzvah #BA11 commands us to honor Yeshua! While honoring and lifting up a person are similar, the two are not precisely the same. Lifting up a person could mean giving them prominence or raising their mood or spirit. Honoring a person is acting in such a way as to acknowledge his or her value, importance, greatness, or authority. When Scripture calls us to lift God and Yeshua up, we are to raise them to prominence with honor.'

  title: Lifting Up Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to lift up Yeshua at every opportunity.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Hearing the words and voice of God and Yeshua has been made possible in the New Covenant through our accessibility to the Holy Spirit. Expecting to hear God’s Voice with a mind to obey him is very important if we are to have an intimate and loving relationship with him ( John 14:15 & 21) – so much so that Romans 8:14 says of it: “All who are led by God''s Spirit are God''s sons.” Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai heard God’s voice audibly and some have reported hearing God audibly today. That notwithstanding, God most often speaks to us through the Holy Spirit (most often opening our understanding of Scripture or answering prayer) in what has come to be called his “still small voice” ( 1 Kings 19:11-12) . It is not usually audible to our ears but, when we hear him, we generally know that we have. Still, we can be mistaken, so we are admonished in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 to “test everything [and] hold onto what is good.”'

  title: Hearing the Words & Voice of God and Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to hear the words and voice of God and Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are two aspects to knowing God. The first is knowing about God – his attributes – what He is like. We can know him in that way through both Scripture and Yeshua because Yeshua and God the father are united, and Scripture tells us that “in him bodily, lives the fullness of all that God is.” ( Colossians 2:9) . The second aspect of knowing God is being in personal relationship with him – dialoguing with him – knowing him as a person. We can only know God that way through Yeshua, because God is a spirit being and Yeshua has been given the responsibility of connecting us to him through the Holy Spirit: “Yeshua said, "I AM the Way- and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except through me. Because you have known me, you will also know my Father; from now on, you do know him- in fact, you have seen him." ( John 14:6-7) . Those who knew God in the Old Testament knew him through Yeshua as well, though they were probably not aware of it and did not have the clarity of New Testament revelation.'

  commandment: We are to know God through Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: To serve Yeshua is also to serve God. One might ask what it means to serve God and why He wants us to serve Him. God is omnipotent so what can we possibly offer Him that He does not already have? The answer is relationship and fellowship. Consider our own young children and what they have to offer us. We are stronger than they, have more knowledge than they, have more wisdom than they, have more money and possessions than they, so what can we possibly want from them? We want their love, their obedience, and their willingness to receive from us. It is the same with our heavenly Father and us.

  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah calls us to “devote” our lives to God and Yeshua; it is related (but somewhat different) to Mitzvah #BA6 that calls us to “offer” ourselves to God. Of course, God will accept our offer, so the two go together. Mitzvah #BA25 calls us to “put God and Yeshua before all things and all people.” This is also related, but its focus is less on ourselves.'

  commentary_rudolph: Mankind was in reconciled relationship with God in the Garden of Eden but fell out of reconciliation when Adam disobeyed God and ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. God wanted to provide a means by which man could come back into relationship with him, so He devised a plan whereby, when the time was right, He would send his son Yeshua to earth and would reconcile with whomever of us did what Adam failed to do – obey him. It is, of course, too late to for us to undo Adam having eaten of the forbidden tree, so our New Covenant means of obeying God is to receive and follow Yeshua as our Lord and Messiah.

  commentary_rudolph: The Bible promises many rewards for obeying God and for conducting ourselves righteously – some during our life on earth and some in Heaven. Eternal life with God is the only heavenly reward that is revealed with specificity; others are referred to as “crowns,” but their nature is not known. The rewards referred to are no doubt incentives for some, but our love for our heavenly Father and knowing He is pleased with us should be reasons enough to obey him and conduct our lives according to the standards He has set for us.

  commandment: We are to seek our reward from God in Heaven.
  commentary_rudolph: The “Good News of Yeshua” is also known as the “Gospel of Yeshua.” Its meaning is that God sent Yeshua to save us from being dead in our sins that originated with the fall of Adam. It includes Yeshua’s miraculous birth, his earthly teachings, his sacrificial death, his resurrection, and his rising to be with his Father (God) and sending back the Holy Spirit in his place. It is essentially the initiation of the New Covenant prophesied by Jeremiah in Jeremiah 31:30(31)- 33(34) . This Mitzvah calls us to embrace the “Good News of Yeshua” in every way, which unavoidably results in our receiving him as our Lord and savior.

  commandment: We are to listen to, believe, and obey the Good News of Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'With Yeshua having now returned to Heaven, loving God the Father and Yeshua (also the Holy Spirit) are essentially the same. All three are people of God and spirit beings, and a question often raised is how we can love a spirit being. As in the case of Mitzvah DA24 (Loving Our Brother & Neighbor), the love we are commanded for God and Yeshua in the Greek New Testament is “ἀγαπήσε” (“ agape ”) and it is ָּ֥ וְ א ָֽ הַ בְ ת (“ v’ahavta, ”) for God in the Tanakh . This kind of love does not imply emotion or feeling, but rather sacrificial responsibility. In the case of our brother and neighbor, that responsibility is to do what is in their best interest, but in the case of God and Yeshua, it is to be obedient. Love and obedience are connected throughout the Scriptures, and never clearer than Yeshua’s words in John 14:15: “If you love me, you will keep my commands.” That notwithstanding, there is a relational component of loving God that must never be forgotten; it is having love for our Heavenly Father as we are his children.'

  title: Loving God & Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to love the Lord Our God & Messiah Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah addresses the word “one” as it applies to God in English translations of the Bible. There are three ways that the word “one” is used in the English Bible: the way it is not relevant in this Mitzvah is when it is referring to a person or people (e.g. “the other one” or “one must). The two ways that are relevant in this Mitzvah are (a) the singular number “1” as in a count of objects (e.g. “one widget”) and (b) the corporate word “one” meaning a collective as in “we are one in our purpose” (a single purpose held by multiple people) or “we are one band of men” (a single band consisting of multiple men). Similar to English where the word “one” can be used for either a singular or composite unity, the Hebrew Bible uses the word “ echad. ” Its use of “ echad ” in Deuteronomy 6:4 (“ Adonai echad, ”) is translated “the Lord is one” and is meant as a composite unity. When the Hebrew Bible intends to say that there is only one God (a singular unity), it may still use the word “ echad ,” so translators try to make it clear by using terms such as “only one,” “no other,” “You alone,” etc. The significance of the word “ echad ” as used in Deuteronomy 6:4 is that it allows for God to be triune (three in one) while still being one God and not three. See Mitzvah #BA43 herein for a discussion of God’s tri-unity.'

  title: Knowing that God is One – Both Singular & Composite
  commandment: We are to know that God is one – both singular and composite.
  commentary_rudolph: '“Fearing” God in 1 Peter 2:17 (CJB): “Be respectful to all- keep loving the brotherhood, fearing God ..” contradicts and not the same as being “afraid” of him as the word “fear” is used in 1 John 4:18 (NKJ): “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.” Being afraid of God and at the same time loving him as in Deuteronomy 6:5 (NKJ): “with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength” is not even possible. Indeed, we are to appreciate God’s power to discipline, but the kind of fear of God we are to have, is ideally one of “reverent” respect for his authority and greatness.'

  commandment: We are to fear and Revere God and Messiah.
  commentary_rudolph: Our foundational relationship with God is one of created beings to creator, but God wants it to be more. He wants to be able to approve of us – approval that is achieved through our obeying his Mitzvot in both the Old and New Testaments. This Mitzvah therefore calls for us to not only obey him, but to succeed in our obedience so we can present ourselves to him in full expectation of his approval.

  title: Presenting Ourselves to God as Worthy of Approval.
  commandment: We are to present ourselves to God as worthy of approval.
  commentary_rudolph: Putting God first tends to be difficult, even for believers, because we are so used to putting ourselves first. This Mitzvah is about not putting other people and things ahead of God, which, of course, means putting God ahead of ourselves and our predilections. Our natural tendency is to resist this Mitzvah because it seems easier, safer, and more predictable to give ourselves to people and things we can see and control, as compared to God who we cannot see and definitely not control! That is not to say that there are never right times to be self-concerned or self- directed. When there is no overriding reason, it is God’s norm for our lives that we keep ourselves safe, happy, and fulfilled. That notwithstanding, this Mitzvah requires that we forego our personal desires and preferences when God, for his purposes, directs us to do so. Our willingness to obey God without struggling is a measure of how discipled we are.

  commandment: We are to be witnesses of and for Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah commands us to receive Messiah’s love and kindness, but it is not his feelings of love and kindness that we are to receive; it is his sacrificial actions of love and kindness – his willingness to endure persecution and even death at the hands of the Romans on our behalf. Scripture tells us about what Yeshua did, but how are we to receive it? The answer is suggested in 1 John 4:19 that tells us: “We ourselves love now because he loved us first.” We therefore receive what Yeshua did for us in love by similarly loving God and our fellow man. We love God and Yeshua through our faith and obedience ( Matthew 22:37-39 and John 14:15) , and our fellow man through our sacrificial actions (dying to self: Luke 9:23 and Ephesians 4:22-2 4) taken in his behalf ( John 2:14-26 and James 2:26) .'

  title: Receiving Yeshua’s Love and Kindness.
  commandment: We are to receive Yeshua’s love and kindness.
  commentary_rudolph: The need for us to offer a blood sacrifice to atone for our sins is a requirement established by God. Under the Mosaic Covenant, the sacrifice was of animals brought to the Tabernacle, and later the Temple, and was assisted by Levitical Priests. In addition to daily sacrifices for the sins of individuals, there was an annual sacrifice of two goats to atone for the sins of the Nation; both kinds of sacrifices had to be repeated day after day and year after year. We read in Jeremiah 31:30(31)-33(34) and Hebrews 8:6-12 that Israel violated God’s covenant and, instead of punishing Israel, God promised them a new and better covenant based on better promises. We now know that the better promises are that we no longer have to sacrifice animals each time we commit sin. Instead, God sent his Son Yeshua to earth as a man to be a once-and-for-all- time sacrifice, so that whosoever of us receive him as our Messiah and repent of our sins are forgiven. We still have to repent each time we sin, but we do not have to repeatedly sacrifice so long as we remain in a faith relationship with Yeshua.

  commentary_rudolph: 'One might ask: “How can a mortal man can have a personal relationship with God (Father & Son) who are spirits?” Scripture discloses three ways: First, by “knowing God.” We can know God through what Scripture reveals about him, and by conversations we can have with him through Holy Spirit - assisted prayer. Second, by relating to God as a child relates to his father. Scripture makes it clear that God is our heavenly Father and that we are his children. Third, by doing God’s will and following his every step. Genesis 5:24 and 6:9 tell us that Enoch and Noah both walked with God; through the Holy Spirit, we can as well.'

  title: Having a Close Personal Relationship with God and Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to have a close personal relationship with God and Yeshua
  commentary_rudolph: The Bible has much to say about God’s abhorrence of lying, but Acts 5:1-10 is the only passage of Scripture about lying to God; all the others are about lying to people. In a way, that makes sense because how can one lye (withhold truth) from God who is all knowing and can read men’s minds? We know from the Scripture that Ananias and Sapphira lied to Peter, but it is puzzling of how it was even possible for them to lie to God. The answer may lie in verse 9 in which Peter chastises Sapphira for plotting (presumably with Ananias) to test the Holy Spirit – i.e. to see if the Holy Spirit lied to them about God’s requirement that they bring all of the proceeds of the sale of their property to the emissaries. Similar to how Adam and Eve (who were in a personal relationship with God) believed Satan that nothing bad would come of their eating from the forbidden tree, Ananias and Sapphira (presumably followers of Yeshua) likewise believed Satan to the extent that they were willing to test the Holy Spirit’s veracity, and this may have constituted blasphemy of the Holy Spirit that we are warned against in Matthew 12:31-32 .

  commentary_rudolph: Despising and hating are similar. It is the authors’ opinion that one can reject and even despise Yeshua as a result of being wrongly taught that his claim to Messiahship and deity is false, but one cannot despise God without Satanic evil having overtaken the despiser. Despising God and /or Yeshua results in rejecting their values and disobeying their commandments.

There are also those who concede that Yeshua is the Messiah, but contend that he is completely mortal and not deity. They come to this by ignoring Colossians 2:9. This Mitzvah is supported by multiple Scriptures that show conclusively that Yeshua is the Messiah, the son of God, and the “fulness of deity.”'

  commentary_rudolph: It is sinful to not believe in the existence of God or not believe that Yeshua is the Messiah, yet it is understandable if one has been wrongly taught. It is a worse sin to believe in God and in Yeshua, know them first-hand, yet turn from them and reject them.

  commandment: We are not to reject or turn away from God or Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Redemption means receiving something back and, in the Bible, can mean receiving back land, animals, or people. Redemption in this Mitzvah refers to receiving us back and saving us from the disastrous consequence of our sins. It is not an exaggeration to say that Yeshua’s atoning sacrifice on the Roman stake was a ransom (a price) that he paid for our redemption – forgiveness for our sins, restoration to righteousness, and release from bondage of sin and death. Comment by Daniel C. Juster The verses supporting this Mitzvah are not in command form but, as in many cases, they are implied. They all support the idea of believing in Yeshua, and that means all the biblical truths about him. As Paul says in I Corinthians 15:3-5 : “For among the first things I passed on to you was what I also received, namely this: the Messiah died for our sins, in accordance with what the Tanakh says; and he was buried; and he was raised on the third day, in accordance with what the Tanakh says; and he was seen by Kefa, then by the Twelve;” It implies that we, similar to the Corinthians, are to believe that Yeshua died for our sins which, in turn, implies that we are to believe all else about him that Scripture reveals.'

  commandment: We are not to contradict or rebuke God.
  commentary_rudolph: Compassion is part feeling and part cognitive identification with a person’s trials and ordeals. Scripture says that God and Yeshua are both compassionate and merciful. Their compassion often leads to mercy, but there are times when it does not, such as when justice requires punishment. Knowing about their compassion and knowing it firsthand are two different things. We know about their compassion from Scripture, but we know it firsthand when we are its recipient despite our knowing how unworthy we are to have received it. Knowing about it and knowing the blessing of it are both required of us in this Mitzvah .

  title: Knowing the Compassion of God and Yeshua
  commandment: We are to know the compassion of God and Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Acts of kindness and blessings are synonymous; they are acts of benevolence performed on behalf of another, often not deserved. It is especially true of the kindness that God has shown and continues to show toward us, given the many times that we have sinned against him. There is no greater blessing of God and Yeshua than the one spoken of in John 3:16-17: "For God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life, instead of being utterly destroyed. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but rather so that through him, the world might be saved.” This is especially impactful when one considers that God sent his sonYeshua into the world to give his life for sins we committed and for which we (not he) deserved to die. Even so, Yeshua in his immense compassion beckoned to us in Matthew 11:28-30: "Come to me, all of you who are struggling and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."'

  title: Welcoming Yeshua by Welcoming Children.
  commandment: We are to welcome Yeshua by welcoming children.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Matzah is traditionally used at Passover meals ( sedarim ) to remember the unleavened bread the Israelites brought with them out of Egypt, and wine is traditionally used to represent the blood of the lamb that was sacrificed and placed on the doorposts of Israelites’ homes to save their firstborn sons from the angel of death.  The matzah eaten by Ashkenazic Jews at their sedarim represents the lamb that was consumed at the original Passover, whereas Sephardic Jews serve lamb as one of the Passover foods for the same reason. Bread and wine have been used as far back as Abraham as elements for sealing covenants. We read in Genesis 14:18-20: “Malki-Tzedek king of Shalem brought out bread and wine. He was cohen of El ''Elyon [God Most High], so he blessed him with these words: "Blessed be Avram by El ''Elyon, maker of heaven of earth and blessed be El ''Elyon, who handed your enemies over to you." Avram gave him a tenth of everything.” At his last seder, Yeshua used matzah and wine in an unusual way but in a way that was consistent with its historical covenantal meaning. We read in Matthew 26:26-28 : “While they were eating, Yeshua took a piece of matzah, made the b''rakhah, broke it, gave it to the talmidim and said, "Take! Eat! This is my body!" Also he took a cup of wine, made the b''rakhah, and gave it to them, saying, "All of you, drink from it! For this is my blood, which ratifies the New Covenant, my blood shed on behalf of many, so that they may have their sins forgiven.” We who are New Covenant believers in Yeshua understand this to be a sacrament intended for us today as well. We call it by various names such as “The Lord’s Table,” “Holy Communion,” “ Seudat Ha-Adon ,” etc., but how often and under what circumstances we are to take it is a matter of debate. It was during a Passover seder that Yeshua lifted the matzah and wine and is quoted in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 t o have said: "This is my body, which is for you. Do this as a memorial to me"; likewise also the cup after the meal, saying, "This cup is the New Covenant effected by my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, as a memorial to me." Some argue, therefore, that Yeshua meant for us to remember him with bread and wine only during Passover. Others argue that the words “as often as you drink it” mean any time we drink wine, and still others say it simply means “often.”'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The triune nature of God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), sometimes referred to as the “Trinity,” is not described in the Bible in those very words, but it can be inferred from several Scriptures read together – most notably Matthew 28:18-19 . The tri-unity of God is not acknowledged in traditional (Rabbinical / Talmudic) Judaism and is controversial even in certain segments of Christianity. Some who believe that Yeshua (Jesus) is the Messiah, nevertheless, deny his deity. Others believe that Yeshua is all of God – i.e., the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in one person. We call that belief “Jesus only.”  So far as I am aware, Messianic Judaism is entirely trinitarian in its belief that God is echad (a composite unity), existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While the three are integrally connected as “one” God, they are able to be at different places on earth (also in Heaven and on earth) at the same time, and can function separately but always cooperatively. For example, we read in Scripture that Yeshua (originally spirit in nature) walked on earth as a human being while, at the same time, the Holy Spirit impacted various individuals and, all the while, God the Father remained in Heaven. While the composite “oneness” of God may be difficult to comprehend, it is not unique in Scripture. The clearest example of it is in Genesis 2:24 (mirrored in Ephesians 5:31 ): Note that “ELOHIM” is a plural word meaning “God.” “ This is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his wife, and they are to be one flesh .” Whereas they are one flesh, they are able to function separately and hopefully cooperatively. Although Yeshua’s Messiahship is not acknowledged within wider Judaism, the Holy Spirit’s ability to be (and function) on earth while God (presumably the Father) remains in Heaven is acknowledged. That notwithstanding, wider Judaism does not consider the Holy Spirit to be an entity or component of a composite God; rather, it considers him to be a kind of spiritual extension of God, and refers to him as “God’s Spirit” or “Spirit of God.” The term “ Ru’ach Ha-Kodesh ” (the Holy Spirit) is used in Psalms 51:13(11) in which David prays to God that he (David) is not taken away from God’s presence – that the Ru’ach Ha-Kodesh is not taken from him. The “ Ru’ach Ha-Kodesh ” is also referred to in Isaiah 63:10-11 in which the Holy Spirit is remembered to have been put among the Israelites by God during the time of Moses. Other times in Scripture, the Holy Spirit is referred to by terms such as the “ Shekinah Glory.” Such is the case in Exodus 24:16-18 in which the Shekinah Glory rested on the Tabernacle, and in Exodus 40:34-38 in which the Shekinah Glory filled the Tabernacle. (See Mitzvah #BA22 herein for a further discussion of God’s single and composite nature . )'

  title: Knowing that God is Triune.
  commandment: We are to know that God is triune.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is one of the most useful and profound of all the commandments given us by God. It speaks to circumstances where we have no human control over a situation, and we dread an adverse result. Our response in the natural is to become depressed and to comport ourselves in ways that are unwise, unhelpful, and possibly even harmful. In short, we allow our quality of life to diminish, and all because we have disregarded this Mitzvah .to rely on God. Yes, we should fervently pray for God to intervene in our behalf, but more than that! We must place ourselves, our loved ones and all we possess and hold dear in his care, and trust in him. Notice I did not say “trust that the result will be to our liking.” We can pray for a particular outcome, but our faith must be for God’s will to be done. If we allow it to be so, He will lift us above all our cares and we will have the shalom of God that “surpasses all understanding.” ( Philippians 4:6-7) . There is a Christian poem and hymn titled “What a Friend We Have in Jesus” 11 that says it perfectly; the words are: What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear. And what a privilege to carry, Everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace we often forfeit, Oh, what needless pain we bear. All because we do not carry, Everything to God in prayer. Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'The Scriptures about rootedness are metaphors of plants and trees that receive their nourishment and stability from their roots. Yeshua says in Revelation 22:16: “I am the root..” Therefore, to be rooted in Yeshua is to be united with him, nourished by him, and spiritually stable through him. Luke 8:13 warns us that those who have no root [presumably in God and Yeshua) will “go on trusting for awhile; but when a time of testing comes, they apostatize.”'

  commentary_rudolph: '“Knowledge of God” is different from “the knowledge of God” and is related to (but different from) “knowing God.” We cannot have “the knowledge of God” because we cannot know all that God knows. We can, however, have “knowledge of God” in that we can and should know about him – knowledge that we acquire from the Bible and from the Holy Spirit as he guides us “into all truth” ( John 16:13) . “Knowing God” is a step more intimate; it is having a personal relationship with God, which is the subject of Mitzvah #BA14.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Rejoicing “with” Yeshua requires knowing what causes him to rejoice. There are no doubt other instances in which Yeshua rejoiced, but one that stands out is in Luke 10:17-24 in which it is said of Yeshua: “he was filled with joy by the Ruach HaKodesh .” Rejoicing “in” Yeshua requires our recognizing and being thankful for what Yeshua did and continues to do for us. A few that come to mind are: (a) he leads us and cares for us ( John 10:2-3 ; 1 Peter 5:7) , (b) he loves us ( Romans 8:35) , (c) he gives us shalom ( Romans 5:1) , (d) he offers us salvation ( John 3:16-17 ), etc.'

  commentary_rudolph: If we were one of Yeshua’s contemporaries, we could have lived along with him and followed him in the flesh physically. But that is not why Sha’ul wrote 1 Thessalonians 5:9-10 to the Thessalonians. Sha’ul was reminding them (and now us) that because Yeshua died on our behalf, we can be spiritually reborn and live with him through the Holy Spirit during our lives here on earth, and face to face in heaven when our earthly journey is over.

  title: Living Along with Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to live along with Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is a direct refutation of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. In “The Institutes of the Christian Religion,” John Calvin wrote: (Translated from French) “By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death.” Calvin taught that Yeshua’s atoning sacrifice was not available to all, but only to an elect who were preordained to be saved. Why then, would Yeshua send his disciples out to “make people from all nations into talmidim, immersing them into the reality of the Father, the Son and the Ruach HaKodesh ..” ( Matthew 28:19 )? Why then, would the Bible tell us: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life..” ( John 3:16) ? Scripture suggests that God can sovereignly select certain ones of us for special treatment and special assignments. We are not all Abraham, we are not all Moses, we are not all Sha’ul, and thank God we are not all Job. Nevertheless, the blessings brought by Yeshua are available to all of mankind equally.'

  commandment: We are to believe that Yeshua was sent for all of humanity.
  commentary_rudolph: A mediator is someone who brings two parties together into agreement. Before their expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve did not need a mediator to converse with God because God and they were in close covenantal relationship. However, as a consequence of Adam’s breach of covenant, humanity became more distant from God so, whereas God could speak directly to whomever He wished, most men had to communicate through a priestly mediator of God’s choosing. God’s covenant with men changed several times over the years as God graciously sought to bring men closer to him. To assist, He selected priests to serve him – priests such as Abraham, Moses, Aaron, David, and many others. The priesthood of Aaron we know about, but we do not usually think of Abraham, Moses, and David as being priests; yet they were because they fulfilled the priestly role of representing mankind to God and God to mankind. We read in Jeremiah 31 that when the Israelites violated their Covenant with God, God mercifully saw fit to give them a New and better Covenant, whereby God’s own son Yeshua came to earth, became High Priest and, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, became the “one [and only] Mediator between God and humanity” ( 1 Timothy 2:5) .

  commandment: We are to know Yeshua as the One Mediator between God and Man.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Hoping is wishing for something in the future combined with an expectation or sense of the likelihood that what is hoped for will (or at least can) come to pass. One cannot rationally hope for that which one believes is impossible, but with God all things are possible. When considering the expression “hope on/in God,” it is reasonable to ask “hope for what?” We can hope for anything we want, but its use in the Bible assumes that we are hoping for that which God wants as well. Hope and faith are not the same. Hope is the anticipation of something that we desire that may or may not come to pass, whereas faith, when properly applied, knows that something will come to pass because God has revealed it. Hebrews 11:1 says it this way: “Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.” This Mitzvah (“We are to set our hope on God”) infers that we should not hope for anything or in anyone other than in God.'

  title: Setting Our Hope on God.
  commandment: We are to set our hope on God.
  commentary_rudolph: Temptations come to us from two sources – from Satan, and from the lusts and desires of our flesh. God sometimes uses these sources and our free will to test us through allowing us to be tempted, but God does not himself tempt us. But isn’t that just semantics? Isn’t that God tempting us indirectly? No, it is not. “Tempting” is intentionally luring and desiring a person to do something he would not ordinarily do (e.g committing sin), whereas in “testing” us, God gives us the opportunity to commit sin in order to find out whether we will; it is his hope that we will not.

  title: Not Attributing Our Temptations to God.
  commandment: We are not to attribute our temptations to God.
  commentary_rudolph: '“Submitting” and “obeying” are (for all practical purposes) synonymous but are treated separately in this compilation because the CJB uses both terms in its Bible translation (see Mitzvah BA10). Submitting to God requires: (1) knowing what God wants of us, and (2) complying with what God wants of us. There are two ways to know what God wants of us (this is beginning to sound like a lesson in mathematics): (a) knowing the Mitzvot contained in Scripture, and (b) hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit who directs us in applying the Mitzvot in the various circumstances of our lives. Knowing the Mitzvot is straight forward; it requires studying the Bible. Hearing the Holy Spirit is less so because it involves our growing in spiritual acuity and in our prayer relationship with God. But now we come to number (2) above – “complying.” Most believers – even new believers – become pretty good about knowing what God wants of us but have difficulty overcoming the obstacle of the flesh that tends to pull us in the other direction. This part of submitting to God is sometimes referred to as “dying to self” and is briefly dealt with elsewhere in this compilation.'

  commandment: We are to submit to God.
  commentary_rudolph: Humbling ourselves before God means being humble in God’s presence. It is inconceivable that any believer would knowingly be otherwise, but there is a way that believers sometimes transgress. It is being arrogant to our fellow man while forgetting that God (being omnipresent) is there and observing us. The most proactive way for us to humble ourselves before God is to confess our sins and repent publicly. Being humble in general is an overlapping Mitzvah that is dealt with separately elsewhere in this compilation.

  commentary_rudolph: We could recount Yeshua’s attributes and character to prove his holiness, but by his being the son of God ( Matthew 3:16-17 ) and his containing the fullness of the deity ( Colossians 2:9) , he is holy by definition. We are therefore to acknowledge Yeshua’s holiness; if we do not, we are not believers and cannot call ourselves his disciples.

  title: Acknowledging the Holiness of Yeshua.
  commandment: We are to acknowledge the Holiness of Yeshua.
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are several ways that Scripture speaks of coming to Yeshua. “Come to me,” in Matthew 11:28 is clear because it uses the word “come.” However, there are other ways that Scripture says it as well, e.g., believing in Yeshua, trusting in Yeshua, calling on Yeshua’s name, and others. There is a difference between believing in Yeshua and merely believing about him – that he is the Messiah. The important question about coming to Yeshua is: “Have we made him OUR Messiah?” To make him our Messiah, not only must we come to him; we must make him our Lord which means giving our lives over to him. Some rely on “what is known as the “Sinner’s Prayer” – a prayer that invites Yeshua into our hearts and asks him to save us. It works if we mean it and does not if we speak it legalistically as a mere formula of words. Resting in Yeshua means putting our cares upon him. There are two Christian poems and hymns that, in my opinion, capture the depth and emotion of coming to Yeshua and resting in him; the first is titled “Just as I Am;” 12 the first three stanzas are: Just as I am, without one plea But that Thy blood was shed for me And that Thou bid''st me come to thee O Lamb of God, I come, I come Just as I am, and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, Words by Charlotte Elliott (1789-1871); original music composed by William B. Bradbury (1816-1868). To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come, I come. Just as I am, though tossed about With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God, I come, I come. The second is titled “What a Friend We Have in Jesus;” 13 the first three stanzas are: What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear! What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer! O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer. Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer. Are we weak and heavy laden, cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge, take it to the Lord in prayer. Do your friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer! In His arms He’ll take and shield you; you will find a solace there.'

  title: Coming to Yeshua for Spiritual Rest.
  commandment: We are to come to Yeshua for spiritual rest.
  commentary_rudolph: When we receive Yeshua as Lord, we come into a union relationship with him and with God the Father through him; this is known as being “born again” ( John 3:3-5 ; 1 Peter 1:23) . So, why does Scripture find it necessary to remind us to stand firm in that union? Does God expect that we will backslide into sin and unbelief? The short answer is that God does not expect it but knows it is possible because He has seen it happen before. Adam and Eve were in a close union relationship with God, and yet they gave in to believing what Satan said over what God said. Scripture is replete with warnings to look out for Satanic attacks through false prophets and temptations of our flesh because, when we become “born again,” we become targets for Satan to try to do to us what he did to Adam. That’s the bad news. The good news is that through our relationship with Yeshua, we have the Holy Spirit to help us fight off temptations of the flesh. Still, as with Adam, we have free will to not do so, and that is why there are so many admonitions that we stand firm in union with Yeshua.

  commentary_rudolph: We often analogize Yeshua’s sacrifice with the animal sacrifices performed in the Tabernacle and Temple because both were to atone for sin. They were, however, not the same because the animals that were slain did not come back to life, whereas Yeshua did. The significance of remembering Yeshua’s resurrection is that HIS was to atone for ALL sin, and to foreshadow the hope of our own resurrection to eternal life if we receive Yeshua as Lord and his sacrifice as our own.

  title: Not Being Ashamed of Yeshua & His Teachings.
  commandment: We are not to be ashamed of Yeshua and his teachings.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Being called and chosen are related but are not the same. Being called is being invited and being chosen is being selected. We read in Scripture that, throughout history, God chose various individuals to carry out his objectives. Some were chosen because they were godly and some because they were evil. Also, not all who were chosen were first called. Because of his evil nature, Judas Iscariot was chosen to be the betrayer of Yeshua; he was not called before he was chosen. Abraham, on the other hand, was first called and then chosen after being tested; we read in Hebrews 11:8: “By trusting, Avraham obeyed, after being called to go out to a place which God would give him as a possession; indeed, he went out without knowing where he was going.” He was tested in other ways as well and was subsequently chosen to become the “father of many nations” ( Genesis 17:3-8) . There are other examples in Scripture of people called and chosen, but the one that is the subject of this Mitzvah is mankind’s call to receive Yeshua as Lord and thereby be chosen to have eternal life. Matthew 22:14 (NKJ) tells us: “for many are called, but few are chosen." The call to receive Yeshua is to all of mankind, but Scripture both recognizes and prophesies that relatively few will heed the call, and therefore few will be chosen. Note that 2 Peter 1:10-11 is an exhortation to: “try even harder to make your being called and chosen a certainty.” It is a warning to believers that if they are not proactive in maintaining their faith they can, over time, backslide in their holiness and their obedience to God.'

  title: Continuing to Make Our Being Called & Chosen a Certainty.
  commandment: We are to continue to make our being called and being chosen a certainty.
  commentary_rudolph: 'The purpose of resting is to receive refreshment and renewal. Various Scriptures command us to rest from work weekly and annually on the various Sabbaths, and to rest our souls in God always. Because Yeshua and the Holy Spirit are echad with God the Father, this Mitzvah could well have had the title of BA2: “Seeking Rest, Refreshment & Renewal in Yeshua and the Holy Spirit.” “Rest,” “refreshment,” and “renewal” are related, but they are not the same and they can mean different things in different contexts. “Refreshment” means revitalization – giving fresh and renewed strength. It is a simple enough concept that applies to our bodies, souls, and spirits, so we will not discuss it further. “Rest” most commonly refers to the physical rest of our bodies that is needed for physiological “renewal.” The Scriptures that command we rest on the various Sabbaths include physical rest but point to a higher kind of rest and renewal as well – rest of our souls and spirits by surrendering ourselves to God and allowing Him to take our burdens and cares upon himself.'

  title: Not Pursuing and Accumulating Worldly Wealth & Possessions.
  commandment: We are not to pursue and accumulate worldly wealth and possessions.
  commentary_rudolph: Matthew 6:19-21 and Scriptures similar it are often misunderstood as speaking against having wealth or doing things that result in wealth. Are all who live by faith to not own homes? To not have bank accounts? To not have retirement plans? Some have taken it this way, but the consensus is that God is not against these and that it is rather our heart attitude in pursuing, acquiring, and accumulating money and property. 1 Timothy 6:9 warns us that “those whose goal is to be rich fall into temptation.” It is not being rich but rather the pursuit of being rich that can compromise us spiritually. Matthew 6:33 directs us to “seek first the kingdom of God.” We cannot do that and make the acquisition of riches our goal at the same time. God may call some of us to be wealthy and, if He does, we can be sure that our wealth has a purpose beyond ourselves and is to be used for the Kingdom.

  title: Putting Yeshua Ahead of Worldly Wealth.
  commandment: We are to put Yeshua ahead of worldly wealth.
  commentary_rudolph: Matthew 6:33 commands us to “seek first his Kingdom.” This means that we are to put God ahead of all worldly things. Consistent with that, Luke 14:33 and Luke 18:22 are explicit that we cannot be disciples of Yeshua if we do not put him before our money and our possessions. In Luke 18:22 , Yeshua told a young man who was following him to sell all he had and distribute the proceeds to the poor. Some take that to mean that we should not own homes, not have bank accounts and not have retirement plans, but it is a mistaken interpretation. Yeshua said what he said because the young man had an idolatry to his wealth and needed to be freed of it. For those of us who are not in bondage to money and possessions, it is not our heart attitude, and there is therefore nothing wrong with our pursuing, acquiring, and accumulating such things within reason.

As the result of evil in the world some do not have even those, and that is why we are commanded to give t zedakah – i.e., provide and care for orphans and widows ( Mitzvah #BB3), support our brother who is in need ( Mitzvah #BB11) and be charitable and generous to our neighbor ( Mitzvah #BB1).'

  title: Not Using Religion to Acquire Riches.
  commandment: We are not to use religion to acquire riches.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is misunderstood if one believes that every attempt to raise money for a religious purpose is wrong. It costs money to feed the poor, support ministers and build or lease congregational buildings. The giving of tithes and offerings to support the Levites, maintain the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and to assist the poor are, in fact, commanded in Scripture. No, this Mitzvah to “not use religion to acquire riches” speaks against a wrong heart attitude of using religion in order to acquire riches. It is not wrong for a minister to want to earn a living through ministry and even to become wealthy while in ministry and through ministry, but it is wrong to pursue ministry for the purpose of becoming wealthy.

  commandment: We are not to set a goal of being rich.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah does not speak against being rich; it speaks against our having a wrong heart attitude toward how we become rich. It is not wrong to want to earn a comfortable living and even to have wealth if we are called by God to have wealth to use for godly purposes. But Scripture says it is wrong for us to set a goal of being rich, the inference being for selfish reasons such as living in luxury, having power over others, or because we do not trust God to provide for our needs.

  title: Not Relying on Riches.
  commandment: We are not to rely on riches.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Because humans are fragile, it is natural for us to have desires and want to be secure from the myriad of things that can beset us. Wanting security and fulfillment of our desires is not the usually the problem – in fact, God invites us to look to him and trust him for these things (see Mitzvah BA44). The problem is that too many of us do not trust God (whom we cannot see with natural eyes) and instead seek security and fulfillment from things we can see – chief among them being wealth (i.e., money and property). Are we hungry? Money can buy us food. Are we naked? Money can buy us clothing. Are we cold and wet? Money can buy us shelter. Are we in danger from others? Money can buy us protection and influence. All of these are logical and true to a point, but the right way to achieve them is through God. 2 Timothy 1:7 says: “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.” When we give in to fear and rely on our wealth instead of on God because we don’t trust that He will come through for us, we break covenant with God and commit sin.'

  title: Speedily Seeking Reconciliation when Summoned to Court
  commandment: We are to speedily seek reconciliation when summoned to court.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Two things should be clear about this Mitzvah (and its supporting Scriptures Matthew 5:25 and Luke 12:58-59 ): (1) It assumes that we are likely wrong about whatever we are accused of; and (2) it instructs us to try to settle a grievance before appearing in court and without compromising biblical principles or values. We believe that, during the First Century, the Romans allowed Jewish courts ( betei din ) to adjudicate private disputes between Jews. An accommodation such as that does not exist between our secular courts and religious institutions today, yet 1 Corinthians 6:1-7 is clear that if a person suing us is a brother believer, he should not be doing so in a secular court. He could, however, do so in an ecclesiastical court ( beit din ), so it is important that believing congregations today (both Jewish and Christian) establish tribunals to adjudicate disputes and settle controversies that arise in their midst. Also, the Scriptures underlying this Mitzvah seem to assume that we were wrong in whatever we are accused of because (they say) that if the matter goes to court, it is likely that we will be “thrown into jail.” The Mitzvah is therefore calling us to try to settle our differences, but without compromising biblical values because (1) compromising biblical values is forbidden by Scripture (i.e., Deuteronomy 5:29(32 ), and (2) because, the party who has done something wrong, is required to repent and, if possible, make full restitution. Subjects related to this Mitzvah (treated elsewhere in this compilation) are loving our neighbor, not sinning against our neighbor, forgiving our neighbor, repenting of sin, and making restitution when we do sin. Also, most of the Scriptures in the Bible about disputes are about disputes between believers, two of the most important being Matthew 5:23-24 and Matthew 18:15-17.'

  title: Seeking Reconciliation with Our Brother
  commandment: We are to seek reconciliation with our brother.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah assumes that an offense (a sin) has been committed (or is thought to have been committed) either by (1) us against a brother believer, or (2) against us by a brother believer. Matthew 5:23-24 speaks to the former and Matthew 18:15-17 speaks to the latter. If it is we who have committed (or are accused of having committed) the offense, our obligation is clear; we are to repent by going to our brother, confessing our sin, asking his forgiveness, making restitution where possible, and attempting to reconcile our relationship. If it is our brother who has committed (or is thought to have committed) the offense, there is a step we must take before implementing the multi-step solution described in Matthew 18:15-17 ; it is to decide whether we should overlook the offense pursuant to Proverbs 19:11 . That is because the alleged offense, while sinful, may have been committed innocently, may be too trivial to pursue, or our relationship may more likely be left intact by our silently forgiving the offense and not pursuing our brother in a formal way ( Ephesians 4:2) . We may, nevertheless, opt for correcting our brother in love pursuant to Galatians 6:1. If we pursue an offense against our brother pursuant to Matthew 18:15-17 , there are three steps that we must take. The first is to go to our brother, show him his fault, and seek reconciliation. If our brother repents then we must forgive him and lay the matter to rest. If he does not, we should again consider whether we should let the matter drop and, if we elect not to do so, Scripture instructs us to return to our brother with one or two others to be witnesses to our conversation and interaction. These witnesses will form their individual opinions of who is right in the controversy, and will try to persuade the wrongdoer to repent. Naturally, if it is we who are wrong, then we must repent to our brother. However, if the witnesses side with us, and our brother will not listen to them and repent, there is a third step that we may pursue, which is to bring the matter to a beit din (ecclesiastical court) of a suitable congregation or apostolic organization. If the beit din rules against our brother and he will not repent by complying with what the beit din requires of him, then Matthew 18:17 says that our brother is to be treated as a “pagan or a tax-collector,” which means an unbeliever. This does not mean shunning our brother unless he continues to sin while holding himself out as a believer, or behaves in such a way as to be divisive in the community. Such a finding allows the innocent party to seek redress and restitution in the public courts as he would be able to do against an unbeliever. For a more detailed discussion of the foregoing, see Mitzvot #DA1, DA4, DA17, DA19, DA34, and DA67. We also recommend reading “ Disputes, Discipline, and Reconciliation in the Body of Believers by Michael Rudolph, published by Tikkun International in 2002.'

  title: Not Harming Our Neighbor.
  commandment: We are not to harm our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah to not harm our neighbor goes hand-in-hand with (but is expressed in an opposite way than) Mitzvah #D12 “Being Good & Kind to One Another.” Failing to be good to our neighbor when we have the opportunity harms him indirectly. Of course, there are direct ways of harming as well; there are physical ways such as committing theft and murder, and more subtle ways such as gossiping, testifying falsely – too many to list, but just as damaging as the physical ways.'

  title: Not Going to Law Against Our Brother in a Secular Court.
  commandment: We are not to go to law against our brother in a secular court as an alternative to a Beit Din of
  commentary_rudolph: 'The most common interpretation of 1 Corinthians 6:1 is that believers must not sue each other in a secular court under any circumstance. Even if that was what Sha’ul meant for the First Century in which he spoke it, I do not believe it should be interpreted that way today. My reasons for saying this comes both from the wider text that includes verses 2 through 7 , and also from our change of circumstances in this Twenty-First Century. First the text: 1 Corinthians 6:1 in the CJB states: “How dare one of you with a complaint against another go to court before pagan judges and not before God''s people?” [b’nei din] According to Jay P. Green, Sr., 17 the Greek words “ καὶ οὐχὶ ” in the verse mean “also not” 18 so, if the verse were translated “and also not,” we have: “How dare one of you with a complaint against another go to court before pagan judges and also not before God''s people?” This seemingly minor change is not minor at all because the inclusion of that one word “also” infers that two believers can litigate an issue in both courts – in a secular court so long as they also bring the matter before a bet din . Since it is unseemly to imbue a secular court with appeal authority over a beit din and risks contradictory judgments if one litigates in the two courts simultaneously, it is my belief that the only way for a believer to bring his or her dispute to a secular court is to first bring it to a beit din and for the beit din to order its removal to a secular court. Now since a beit din is imbued with biblical authority to judge controversies why, one may ask, is it ever necessary to bring a matter to a secular court? It is because in this Twenty-First Century and in most western nations, b’nei din are not allowed the same jurisdictions and, in the case of overlapping jurisdictions, the same powers of enforcement as they had in ancient times – even during the lifetimes of Yeshua and Sha’ul. The result is that, without recourse to secular courts, contesting believers today would not be able to receive justice in certain matters, could they not find their way to a secular court. The principal way that a believer is to initiate resolution of his complaint against another believer is detailed in Matthew 18:15-18 . This assumes that the complaint is civil and not criminal, since criminal offenses are against secular society at large and not against individuals. B’nei din today Jay P. Green, Sr., The Interlinear Bible , ed. 2, 1986. Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance translates the Greek word #3750 as “not indeed” and “nay, not.” are given no jurisdiction in secular criminal matters, but do have limited jurisdiction over matters in the communities to which they belong. The complaining believer is to go first to his brother alone and, if reconciliation of his complaint is not achieved, he is to bring one or two witnesses with him and try again. If that is unsuccessful and he chooses to proceed, he asks for a beit din of believers to
    be convened to hear his complaint and render judgment. If judgment is rendered against the responding brother and the brother does not receive the judgment or disobeys orders of the beit din, the community of believers is informed, and the respondent is treated as if he were an unbeliever. Since there is no prohibition against believers suing unbelievers in secular courts, this is one way that a controversy between believing brothers can end up there. It is the route that should be taken when a believer in Yeshua seeks a divorce or separation from his or her spouse regardless of whether his or her spouse is a believer. The purpose is to determine, by a finding of the beit din, whether or not the divorce sought is on biblically allowed grounds. Also, after a biblical divorce (a get ) is granted, the innocent believing spouse may still need to follow up in a secular court in order to be able to remarry or to receive enforced child support. Another way for a controversy between believers to be rightly adjudicated in a secular court is for a beit din to authorize it. There is sometimes a need for secular intervention due to the limitation of a beit din’s jurisdiction or power of enforcement. An example is when a key witness is subpoenaed and refuses to testify. A beit din cannot arrest the witness and bring him to court, whereas a secular court can. There are a myriad of other circumstances as well in which a secular court can act but a beit din cannot. One such circumstance is where a beit din renders judgment against a respondent for a sum of money, and the respondent ignores the judgment. The beit din cannot attach the respondent’s property to satisfy the judgment, whereas a secular court can. 1 Corinthians 6:7 says: “ Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?” This applies if retribution is all that is being sought, but it is different if justice is at stake, or satisfying a money judgment is needed for a complainant’s survival.'

  title: Serving One Another.
  commandment: We are to serve one another.
  commentary_rudolph: 'The subject of peer servanthood is given a high priority of importance in the New Testament but is only addressed by implication and example in the Tanakh . It is strongly implied in Leviticus 19:18: “love your neighbor as yourself,” and there are many references in the Tanakh to our responsibility to provide for our fellow man who is poor, needy, and disabled. Servanthood is referred to throughout the Tanakh in regard to priestly service and serving God, but as to serving our fellow man it is typically “servitude” – the kind of servanthood that is subordinate to a master. Slavery is spoken of in both Testaments as well, as is also indentured servanthood, a kind of “slavery for a season.”  By contrast, Mitzvot urging servanthood are so important in the New Testament, that Yeshua and God Himself are portrayed as being servants to mankind.'

  title: Showing Respect for One Another.
  commandment: We are to show respect for one another.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Respecting a person means treating him as having value; our primary value is that we are all children of God. The Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah instruct us to show respect to all, and that is especially challenging when dealing with enemies and with people who are of evil intent. Respecting a person’s humanity does not, however, necessarily mean respecting what he says, what he does, or what he stands for. Nor does it mean that we wish him well in his bad deeds, nor do we fail to bring him to justice if it is needed. There is a humorous story told about a Quaker 19 who awakened one night to find a burglar in his house. Out of respect and compassion for the burglar as a human being and not wanting to cause him injury, the Quaker said to the burglar: “Friend, I would not hurt thee for the world, but you are standing in the spot where I intend to shoot!” 😊'

  title: Being Sensitive to Each Other’s Needs.
  commandment: We are to be sensitive to each other’s needs.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah and Mitzvot #BB1 to BB11 are related in their all having to do with providing for and helping with each other’s needs. Complying with this Mitzvah comes before the others, however, because one must be sensitive to recognize another’s need before one can even consider helping. There are, however, some needs that do not require much or any sensitivity because we are commanded to be proactive in providing for them. One such example is Mitzvah #BB7: “Supporting Our Family Financially.” One does not need much sensitivity to observe that our family is unfed, unclothed, or unsheltered. On the other hand, a similar need of our brother or neighbor may not be that obvious. Being sensitive to another’s needs is inextricably related to Mitzvah #AA10: “Having Godly Compassion” because our sensitivity does no good if our compassion (derived from our faith) does not cause us to help. This is exemplified in James 2:15-16: “Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food, and someone says to him, "Shalom! Keep warm and eat hearty!" without giving him what he needs, what good does it do?”'

  commandment: We are to befriend people who are humble.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah recognizes that being humble is a good character trait and directs us to befriend people who are of good character. The opposite is also true, that being arrogant (the opposite of being humble) is a bad character trait, and we are warned away from befriending people of bad character.

  commandment: We are to give to our neighbor that which is owed him.
  commentary_rudolph: If one were to merely read the statement of this Mitzvah one might conclude that its reference to giving our neighbor what is owed is only to money. That is not the case, however, for the three supporting Scriptures indicate that a debt can also be of ministry, of honor, and of material things that may include money, but may also include such things as clothing and shelter. This diversity is made especially clear in Scriptures of the Tanakh that speak of owing the return of land in the year of jovel (Jubilee), the paying of wages, the release of a debtor from servitude, and the application of justice.

  commandment: We are to do what we can to live in peace with our neighbors.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is very clear that we are to do all we can do biblically to live in peace with our neighbor. Implied in the statement is the reality that accomplishing the goal requires our neighbor’s cooperation as well.

  title: Bearing the Weaknesses of Those Who Are Not Strong
  commandment: We are to bear the weaknesses of those who are not strong.
  commentary_rudolph: 'The meaning in Scripture of not being strong is not referring to muscular strength. It is referring to lack of spiritual strength – weakness of faith that results in sin and personal unfulfillment. One can also argue that Romans 15:1 applies to widows, orphans, and others who are not strong due to a handicap, disability, or circumstance. Supporting widows and orphans is the subject of Mitzvah BB3 in this compilation. This Mitzvah #DA11 instructs us to bear (i.e., carry – not bear with or condone) the weaknesses of those who are not spiritually strong or are handicapped with a disability; this means taking upon ourselves the weight (the responsibility) of ministering comfort, godly direction, and sometimes physical helps and provisions to such people provided, of course. they are willing to receive it. It is a weight on us because it is easier to avoid such people and their problems, and yet we are called to “love your neighbor as yourself” ( Matthew 22:39 ); in doing so, however, we must always remember that although we serve our fellow man, it is ultimately the Holy Spirit that helps us overcome our weaknesses ( Romans 8:26) .

  title: Being Good, Kind, & Generous to One Another.
  commandment: We are to be good, kind, and generous to one another.
  commentary_rudolph: Being good to one another is similar to being kind to one another. Being good, being kind, being generous, and being nice, are not always the same. Is it being good and kind to give our neighbor money to support his alcoholic addiction? Our neighbor may think so, but by God’s standards it is not, and it is not the kind of generosity that God desires of us! Other decisions we may have to make as to what is appropriate generosity and what is good or kind and what is not may not be this obvious, so we need to rely on the Holy Spirit to guide us.

  title: Not Associating with Persons Who Would Deceive Us or Lead Us
  commandment: We are not to associate with people who would deceive us or lead us astray.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah is meant to protect us from people who would seek to cause us harm through their disingenuous and seductive ways. It is secondarily meant to protect others who observe us having fellowship with such people and concluding therefrom that they can trust those people’ beliefs and behaviors as it appears that we do. That notwithstanding, John 17:15-16 exhorts us to be in the world but not of the world for the purpose of being able to minister God’s Word. We are therefore to not eschew all contact with such people, but rather to make certain, in our contacts with them, that we keep an appropriate distance, and that we – not they – lead in and maintain control of our relationship.

  title: Submitting to One Another.
  commandment: We are to submit to one another as we are led by the Holy Spirit.
  commentary_rudolph: “Submitting to one another” means subordinating our desires (and sometimes even our welfare) to the needs and welfare of another; it is a term that means putting another before our self. Submitting to God and Messiah must be total and unconditional, but our submitting to one another per this Mitzvah has its biblical and godly limits. Do we comply with the demand of another that we procure something for him illegally? Of course not. Do we risk our life to save the life of another? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. Each situation in which we are called to give something of ourselves for another calls for wisdom that can only reliably be acquired from the Holy Spirit. The examples I gave are extreme; more often we are called to submit to others with our love, our compassion, our time, our money, and sometimes our property – sacrificial, nevertheless. There are no criteria for deciding whether to, or how much to, but Ephesians 5:21 in the CJB says that we are to submit to one another “in fear of the Messiah” (the NKJ version says “in the fear of God”). The word “fear,” as used here, means in compliance with God’s will – hence the need for us to pray to God and be directed by the Holy Spirit.

  title: Being Likeminded and in Unity with the Brethren.
  commandment: We are to be likeminded and in unity with the brethren.
  commentary_rudolph: The very existence of Scriptures that implore us to be likeminded and in unity suggests that at the time they were written the body of believers was not. That was then, and now is now, and nothing much has changed; we still are not. Being in unity requires first being likeminded, and being likeminded can only occur when we ascribe to the same laws and principles of conduct; for we who are believers in Yeshua, the laws and principles must be the Word of God as recorded in the Tanakh and the Kitvey B’rit Chadasha. We live in a predominantly secular society under secular governments. When believers, acting through our congregations and churches, listen to God and interpret the Scripture in the same correct way, we are a godly witness and are able to influence society in a godly direction. When we are not likeminded and not in unity, we play into the hands of the adversary, weaken God’s influence, and strengthen that of the adversary.

  title: Encouraging One Another.
  commandment: We are to encourage one another.
  commentary_rudolph: The encouragement spoken of in this Mitzvah is toward godly ends – not ends that are ungodly. God encourages us and wants us to do likewise for others. There are times in all our lives when we feel down about something and when a word of encouragement buoys us up and help us to keep going. Even if we are not feeling down, godly encouragement gladdens our hearts and reminds us of our worth to God and others, and of the things we do.

  commandment: We are to stay away from a brother whose life is not in accord with the teachings and
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah commands us to stay away from a brother believer whose life is not in accord with the teachings and traditions of the Shl’chim, which means with Scripture. Implied in this is that the brother is unrepentant; it is not instructing us to stay away from a brother who sins and then repents. The purpose of this Mitzvah is twofold: (1) to shame the sinning brother into reconsidering his sin and repenting, and (2) to avoid our being influenced by our sinning brother and falling into sin ourselves. We should take note that this Mitzvah is not instructing us to stay away from sinning unbelievers. We are not to have close fellowship with them, but we are permitted to be in their company, and they in ours, so we can prevail upon them to repent and receive the Lord.'

  commandment: We are not to cause our neighbor or brother to stumble.
  commentary_rudolph: To stumble means to not obey God or Yeshua, knowledge we acquire through Scripture and/or the Holy Spirit. Unbelievers stumble by not believing in them or by rejecting their values. Believers presumably know God’s values, but they can nevertheless stumble by giving in to temptation. Both unbelievers and believers can fall prey to being tempted or led astray by another person, and this Mitzvah commands us to not be that other person.

  title: Not Associating with a Sexually Immoral Brother.
  commandment: We are not to associate with a sexually immoral brother.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is a sub-commandment of #DA74 that we not associate with a supposed brother believer who is committing immoral sin ( 1 Corinthians 5:11) . Not associating (i.e., not fellowshipping) with people who call themselves believers while continuing to engage in serious (especially moral) sins is sometimes referred to as “shunning.” There are three reasons for shunning such people: (1) continuing our association with them encourages a continuation of their sinful behavior; (2) continuing our association with them reflects badly on the body of believers by appearing to condone their sin; and (3) continuing our association with them puts us in danger of being tempted and possibly becoming embroiled in their sin. Notwithstanding the above, there are two caveats that need to be remembered: (1) This Mitzvah applies to people calling themselves believers – not to unbelievers. If we stop associating with unbelievers, we cannot witness God’s Word to them; we do, however, need to put restrictions on the ways that we associate with unbelievers, lest we be identified with their sin and even tempted to sin ourselves. (2) This Mitzvah assumes that a supposed believer from whom we are disassociating is not repentant and is continuing to sin; we must be prepared and willing to receive the person back in fellowship if and when he or she repents. Envy, jealousy, and covetousness are in some ways the same and in some ways different. All three are the result of dissatisfaction, are triggered by comparing ourselves with others, and are desirous of things that others have that we do not. Typical of such things are physical appearance, status, wealth, possessions, abilities, relationships, privileges, one’s spouse, and many others. The way in which envy and jealousy are different is the “loudness” with which they are expressed. Envy is more of a quiet discontentment that begrudgingly craves something possessed by another, whereas jealousy fears or resents losing something to another that we believe belongs to us. Covetousness is jealousy carried a step further. It is contemplating owning or taking possession of something that belongs to another and resenting the person who possesses what we want. The wrongfulness of taking (or even thinking of taking) something that belongs to another is intuitive and a violation of Torah but why, we may ask, does Scripture command us against envy, jealousy, and covetousness even when we do not bring harm to another? It is because we are to believe with conviction that God has given us that which He wants us to have, and we are therefore to be content with what we have. The Apostle Sha’ul is clear about it in Philippians 4:11 where he wrote: “Not that I am saying this to call attention to any need of mine; since, as far as I am concerned, I have learned to be content regardless of circumstances.” And in Hebrews 13:5, he also wrote: “Keep your lives free from the love of money; and be satisfied with what you have;
    for God himself has said, "I will never fail you or abandon you." Dissatisfaction that results in envy or jealousy is therefore dissatisfaction with God who is the giver of what we have, which is, of course, wrong and a sin.'

  title: Not Being Envious, Jealous, or Covetous of Our Neighbor.
  commandment: We are not to be envious, jealous, or covetous of our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: The King James Version of the Bible translates Exodus 20:13(13) and Deuteronomy 5:17(17) as “Thou shalt not kill. However, the Hebrew words ָָּּ֥֥ ָּ֥ל  ֹ֖֥אָּ֥תִּ רְ צ ָֽ ח are more properly translated “not murder.” The distinction is important because there are reasons for killing human beings that do not constitute murder; examples are killing in war, killing by accident, killing in self-defense, and killing pursuant to legal process. It is a matter of current debate as to whether mercy killings and aborting unborn children should be considered murder. It is interesting that Matthew 5:21-22 associates murder with nursing anger and demeaning a brother contemptuously. Perhaps it is because both of these actions imply improperly removing our brother from our lives as effectively as if we have murdered him.

  title: Not Committing Murder.
  commandment: We are not to murder.
  commentary_rudolph: In modern vernacular, “stealing” is the stealthy taking from another something that does not belong to us, whereas “robbery” is the taking of what does not belong to us by the use of force. The biblical translations do not seem to make that distinction and apply both terms “robbery” and “stealing” as simply the unlawful taking something of value from another. In Scripture, the value of that which is taken is not necessarily something monetary, but can be such things as children ( Genesis 42:36) , rights ( Isaiah 10:1-2 and Malachi 3:5) , words ( Jeremiah 23:30) , power ( 1 Corinthians 1:17) , etc.

  title: Not Robbing or Stealing from Our Neighbors.
  commandment: We are not to rob or steal from our neighbors.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah prohibits the conveying of untrue or false information about a person. Such conveyance can damage a person’s reputation and sometimes even his freedom or his life if given as false testimony in a court of law. There are several words often associated with this Mitzvah . “Slander” (also “backbiting”) as used by Bible translators means saying or writing something derogatory about a person that is untrue. Slander” that is knowingly spoken in a court of law is called “perjury,” and is itself unlawful. I say “knowingly,” because slanderous testimony given in error is not considered “perjury.” A word used in contemporary law but not used in Bible translations is “libel.” “Libel” is distinguished from “slander” in today’s jurisprudence in that “slander” is derogatory and untrue information about a person that is spoken, whereas “libel” is information of the same character that is written or otherwise conveyed in a form that has greater permanence and is therefore considered more damaging. “Libel” and “slander” are both “defamation” because both “unjustly” harm a person’s reputation. “ Lashon hara ” (evil tongue) is a rabbinical halachic term that is different from both “slander” and “libel” in that “ lashon hara ” is the spoken or written conveyance of derogatory information about a person regardless of whether the information is defamatory (i.e. true or untrue) and whether malevolent or innocent. “Gossip” is similar, except the information conveyed need not be derogatory. All of this is to say that we are not to defame or give false testimony against our neighbor regardless of what it is called.

  commandment: We are not to slander or give false testimony against our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: The New Testament Greek word for “love” as it applies to this Mitzvah (e.g. in Matthew 22:39 ) is ἀγαπήσε” (“ agape ”). Unlike the English word “love” in today’s vernacular, “ agape ” does not imply emotion or feeling; rather it implies a sacrificial responsibility to do for another that which is in his or her best interest. The equivalent Hebrew word for “and love” in Leviticus 19:18 is ָּ֥ וְ א ָֽ הַ בְ ת ( “v’ahavta ,”), the root word of which carries the same meaning as “ agape .”

  commentary_rudolph: 'Defrauding means intentionally dealing falsely. It is often encountered in matters involving money but can involve agreements of any kind. Reneging on a promise that is not connected to receiving something of value in return may be wrong and unkind, but it is not fraud because the nature of fraud is to intentionally misrepresent and deceive another for the purpose of gaining an advantage or benefit. A person may be damaged by relying on a misrepresentation, but the misrepresentation is not fraud unless it is intentional. There are an infinite number of ways that fraud can occur; here are just a few for clarification: • “A” sells “B” a widget as workable, knowing that the widget is defective. • “A” lies about his credentials and experience to gain employment. • “A” falsely expresses love for “B” and marries “B” solely for the purpose of acquiring ownership of “B’s” property.'

  commentary_rudolph: The quarreling and fighting referred to in this Mitzvah does not prohibit arguing or debating in a civil manner, or quarreling with someone for good reason, such as if he has done us harm ( Proverbs 3:30 ). Also, the fighting referred to in this Mitzvah is not primarily of the physical kind, but rather similar to quarreling in that it is through angry and abusive words. Otherwise, the statement of this Mitzvah is self-explanatory.

  commandment: We are not to quarrel or fight with our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: Intimidation is the act of doing or saying something (e.g. through threats) that causes someone to become weak with fear. We glean from Luke 3:14, where Yeshua instructed soldiers to not intimidate anyone, that intimidation of innocent and defenseless people is wrong. “Innocent and defenseless” is not stated in the Scripture, but it is assumed since the principal duty of a soldier is to fight against an enemy and hopefully make him afraid so he will surrender. In 2 Corinthians 10:1-2, Paul is reluctant to intimidate those to whom he is about to bring correction, and 2 Timothy 1:7 tells us that God has not given us a spirit of timidity (fear). It is therefore fair to conclude that we are instructed not to intimidate our neighbor unnecessarily.

  commentary_rudolph: Mercy, compassion, love, and forgiveness are closely related. Compassion is a deep empathetic feeling for another’s difficulties, while mercy refers to actions taken in response to feelings of compassion. It is technically possible to show mercy without having compassion, and to be compassionate while withholding mercy. That notwithstanding, God calls us to both, and they are listed as separate Mitzvot in this compilation. In the Tanakh , except for the two Scriptures noted above, Scriptures on compassion and mercy are God’s toward us, and not our compassion and mercy toward others.

  title: Being Merciful and Not Heartless, or Ruthless.
  commandment: We are to be merciful and not heartless, or ruthless.
  commentary_rudolph: A term often associated with “giving support” is “enabling,” because when one gives support to the actions of another, it allows him (or makes it easier for him) to continue doing what he is doing or allows him to avoid consequences for what he has done. A person who gives support to a wrongdoer is often seen as an accomplice and held accountable for the wrongful act as if he, himself, had committed it. Also, enabling the actions of a wrongdoer can be overt (e.g., acting as a lookout in a burglary) or subtle such as giving sanctuary to a person known to have committed a crime. Such was the famous (albeit controversial) case of Dr. Samuel Mudd who gave medical assistance to John Wilkes Booth during his flight from having assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. Dr. Mudd was convicted and jailed for conspiracy because the court who tried him ruled that his medical treatment of Booth constituted support of Booth’s crime.

  title: Not Giving Support to Wrongdoers.
  commandment: We are not to give support to wrongdoers.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Hate is the opposite of love, and Matthew 22:39 and other Scriptures command us to “love your neighbor as ourself,” i.e. everyone. But this Mitzvah speaks only of our not hating our brother, so who then is our brother? Mark 3:35 says: “Whoever does what God wants is my brother, sister and mother!" and Hebrews 13:1-2 says: “Let brotherly friendship continue; but don''t forget to be friendly to outsiders; for in so doing, some people, without knowing it, have entertained angels.” Also, 1 John 3:1 says: “See what love the Father has lavished on us in letting us be called God''s children! For that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it has not known him.” The inference of these Scriptures is that our brother is only he (or she) who is a believer and follower of Yeshua (or least a believer and follower of God). On the other hand, Proverbs 14:21 : “He who despises his fellow sins, but he who shows compassion to the humble is happy.” The word in Hebrew translated “fellow” is so broad as to include our neighbor, regardless of our neighbor’s belief in God or Yeshua, and the word in Hebrew translated “despises” is similar to the word “hates.” It is because of this Scripture and the commandment to “love your neighbor” that I consider “brother” (in this Mitzvah ) to mean “fellow human being.”'

  commandment: We are not to hate our brother.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Empathy and sympathy are different. Empathizing is imagining ourselves in the joyful or sorrowful place of another, and feeling what we imagine he or she is feeling. Sympathizing is cognitively understanding the sorrowful predicament of another, and wishing it were not so. Both empathy and sympathy require having godly compassion which is the subject of Mitzvah #AA10.'

  commandment: We are to empathize and sympathize with our neighbor’s joys and sorrows.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Looking down on others, as meant in this Mitzvah usually results from comparing ourselves to others and, with disrespect, concluding that we are superior or better. It is the sin of pride that is spoken against in the Mitzvot in category “EA. Humility & Pride,” infra. What this Mitzvah does not preclude is our observing the conduct of another, and objectively concluding that it can or should be improved or discontinued. The key Scriptures that support this Mitzvah refer to “brother” and not “neighbor” Yet, referring to Mitzvah #DA31 and Proverbs 14:21 : “He who despises his fellow sins, but he who shows compassion to the humble is happy.” The word in Hebrew translated “fellow” is so broad as to include our neighbor, regardless of our neighbor’s belief in God or Yeshua, and the word in Hebrew translated “despises” is similar to the words “looking down on” (“hates” in DA31). It is because of this Scripture and the commandment to “love your neighbor” in Matthew 22:39, that although this Mitzvah is about brothers, I believe the wider message of the Bible is to not look down on a “fellow human being.”'

  commentary_rudolph: 'Mitzvah #DA15 calls for us to be in unity with the brethren, and this Mitzvah , related to it, instructs us to not even associate with a divisive brother. There are three reasons for it. First, our continuing to associate with such a brother is likely to encourage him in his sinful behavior. Second, we will risk being affected by and joining him in his divisiveness. And third, our being seen associating normally with the divisive brother may justify and validate his divisiveness in the eyes of others.'

  commentary_rudolph: Extortion is obtaining something from another through force, threats, or other coercive means. That which is acquired need not be money or property but can also be actions such as favors. Blackmail is a form of extortion where the extorter threatens to release damaging information about a person unless the person acquiesces to the extorter’s will in some way. The New Covenant Scriptures supporting this Mitzvah were selected due to the word “extortion” appearing in the NKJ and KJV translations of the Bible. The CJB and other translations employ other words but the meaning is clear from Scriptures of the Tanakh .

  title: Not Extorting Our Neighbor.
  commandment: We are not to extort our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: 'FORGIVENESS IN JEWISH TRADITION While there is no explicit commandment in the Torah requiring that we forgive our brother, there is one Scripture, Leviticus 19:17 , that implicitly means the same thing: "Do not hate your brother in your heart, but rebuke your neighbor frankly, so that you won''t carry sin because of him. Don''t take vengeance on or bear a grudge against any of your people; rather, love your neighbor as yourself; I am ADONAI." Rabbinical literature endorses the principle of forgiving others and gives Genesis 50:16-21 (Yosef''s forgiveness of his brothers) as the example we are to follow. Beyond that, all other references to forgiveness are rabbinic; they include: Mishnah : Yoma 8:9; Baba Kama (92a) 8:5 Talmud : Yoma 86b; Rosh HaShana 17a; Ta''anith 20a, b; Beitz 32b; Shabbat 151b Shulchan Aruch : Yom Kippur 606:1 Mishneh Torah : De''ot 6:6, 9; Madda 6:6, 9; Teshuvah 2:9, 10, 11; 4:3 PERSONAL FORGIVENESS 21 It is clear, however, from the New Covenant Scriptures, that there are not one, but two kinds of forgiveness – personal (which is unconditional) and judicial (which is conditional) – and our responsibility to forgive others is different for each of them. I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in Mark 11:25 22 "personal forgiveness:" "And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses." Notice that this kind of forgiveness is truly without condition, and is to be granted, not only to brothers in the Lord, but to anyone who has sinned against us. It does not seek to judge the offender, nor does it require that the offender be repentant. It must be given as soon as possible after the offense is committed so that bitterness does not take root within us and do spiritual damage. This kind of forgiveness is essentially a releasing of the matter to God and does not retain anger or a desire for personal vengeance (see Ephesians 4:31-32 ). Personal forgiveness is a manifestation of godly love that we are to give, even to our enemies ( Luke 6:27-32) . Yeshua illustrated this kind of forgiveness when, in Luke 23:34a, he besought his Father in heaven to forgive his Roman soldier executioners who were, even at that moment, subjecting him to an unjust and painful death. Our granting personal forgiveness and not harboring bitterness against those who have sinned against us purges us of unholy attitudes that may have resulted from our being victimized, and Sometimes termed "unconditional forgiveness." In other translations, verses 25-26 . opens the way for God to forgive us for our sins as well. Conversely, if we do not grant personal forgiveness, Mark 11:25, 23 Matthew 6: 14-15 , and Luke 6:37 convey the certainty that God will not forgive us either. Granting personal forgiveness does not, however, mean that the relationship or trust between people is restored. It only means that the person who has forgiven has freed himself from anger
    and a desire for vengeance, and that he has a heart to see the person who has sinned against him repent so that he might be blessed by God. JUDICIAL FORGIVENESS I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in Luke 17:3-4 "judicial f orgiveness.” 24 “Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times he comes to you and says, ''I repent,'' you are to forgive him.” Judicial forgiveness is different from personal forgiveness in several ways that the Luke Scripture illustrates. First, judicial forgiveness applies only to brother believers. 25 Second, whereas personal forgiveness must be given whether or not there is repentance, judicial forgiveness is only granted if the offending brother repents. The brother who has been sinned against is required to judge whether the offending brother has repented before the offended brother forgives him. It is different in another way as well, as illustrated in John 20: 23, which states: “If you forgive someone''s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you hold them, they are held.” Here you see that if the one who is sinned-against judges that his offending brother is repentant and forgives him, God also forgives the offending brother. Conversely, if the one who is sinned against withholds forgiveness because, in his judgment, his offending brother is not repentant, then God honors the judgment and does not forgive the offending brother either. One may ask why John 20:23 applies only as between believers since the Scripture doesn''t say that! It is because the verse involves judging, and 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 allows us to judge those who are believers, but not those who are not. FORGIVENESS HAS NO LIMITS There is no maximum number of times that we must forgive those who sin against us, even if they do so repeatedly. As previously stated in Luke 17:4: “Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times he comes to you and says, ''I repent,'' you are to forgive him.” And similarly, in Matthew 18:21-22 : 23 ibid. Sometimes referred to as “conditional” or “transactional” forgiveness. Understand that everything said about a brother believer applies to a sister as well. “Then Kefa came up and said to him, ‘Rabbi, how often can my brother sin against me and I have to forgive him? As many as seven times?’ ‘No, not seven times," answered Yeshua, ‘but seventy times seven!’” Caveat Scripture''s requirement that we forgive does not negate our responsibility to cooperate with public authorities when matters of justice or the protection of others is involved.'

  title: Forgiving Those Who Sin Against Us.
  commandment: We are to personally forgive all who sin against us, and judicially forgive brothers who sin
  commentary_rudolph: 'Scripture has much to say about prisoners and being imprisoned. 26 Some of the translations of Hebrews 13:3 (and other Scriptures) can be read as referring only to people in physical prisons, while others can be read to include people mistreated generally. It is especially so when one considers verses 1 and 2: “Let brotherly friendship continue; but don''t forget to be friendly to outsiders; for in so doing, some people, without knowing it, have entertained angels.” In other Scriptures such as Isaiah 61:1 , imprisonment refers to the spiritual bondage of sin that separates us from God: “The Spirit of Adonai ELOHIM is upon me, because ADONAI has anointed me to announce good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted; to proclaim freedom to the captives, to let out into light those bound in the dark;” Yeshua spoke similarly in Luke 4:18-19 after reading from the Scroll of Isaiah: “The Spirit of ADONAI is upon me; therefore he has anointed me to announce Good News to the poor; he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the imprisoned and renewed sight for the blind, to release those who have been crushed, to proclaim a year of the favor of ADONAI.” Not only did Yeshua employ the Good News to free those who were spiritually imprisoned, but we read in Luke 9:1-6 that he sent his disciples out to do the same: “Calling together the Twelve, Yeshua gave them power and authority to expel all the demons and to cure diseases; and he sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to heal. He said to them, "Take nothing for your trip- neither a walking stick nor a pack, neither bread nor money; and don''t have two shirts. Whatever house you enter, stay there and go out from there. Wherever they don''t welcome you, shake the dust from your feet when you leave that Sometimes the word “captive” is used when meaning prisoner. town as a warning to them." They set out and went through village after village, healing and announcing the Good News everywhere.” Considering the application of these Scriptures to Hebrews 13:3 – yes, we are called to minister to prisoners in physical prisons, but considering the greater numbers of those who are imprisoned by their sin and by not knowing God and Yeshua, how much more are we, Yeshua’s latter day disciples, called to empathize with, and bring the Good News to, those who are spiritually imprisoned and headed for a sentence of death.'

  commentary_rudolph: Rivalry is often confused with competitiveness, and it is sometimes truly difficult to distinguish between them. In situations of competition (e.g. in sports), someone wins and others lose but, ideally, the competitors’ desires are purely to win and they do not harbor bad feelings toward each other. Rivalry is a form of competition, but where the rivaling parties desire not only to win, but to best their opponent and put their opponent down. Because the attitude of rivalry is incompatible with loving our neighbor, competition is allowed to believers, but rivalry is not.

  commandment: We are not to engage in rivalry.
  commentary_rudolph: Vengeance and revenge are not the same. Vengeance is the infliction of punishment or retribution exacted for the commission of an injury or wrongful act. Avenging (causing vengeance) is answering a wrongful act by punishing or requiring retribution from a wrongdoer; it is sometimes appropriate (and sometimes even required) by both biblical and secular law. Revenge, on the other hand, is the infliction of punishment or retribution with an attitude of wanting to hurt a person in return for his having hurt us. Revenge is always wrong because Scripture calls us to love and forgive our neighbor and even our enemies. The prohibition of this Mitzvah to not be vengeful, forbids us from taking revenge or even wanting to take revenge for a wrong committed against us. Our obligation is to forgive those who have hurt us and, when vengeance is appropriate, Romans 12:19 requires that we give it over to the Lord.

  title: Not Being Vengeful.
  commandment: We are not to be vengeful.
  commentary_rudolph: There are several Scriptures on being welcoming and several on not being obnoxiously argumentative, but there is only one that commands us to welcome but not argue with those who are weak in faith. We must be welcoming in order to fulfil our obligation to disseminate God’s Word and the Good News of Yeshua. We are to answer questions appropriately asked and respond with gentleness to opposing views, but we are not to engage in arguments with people who are weak in faith and have not been prepared by the Holy Spirit to receive the truths of God.

  title: Welcoming & Not Arguing with Persons Who Are Weak
  commandment: We are to welcome & not argue with people who are weak in faith.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Hebrews 13:1-2 distinguishes between having friendships with brothers and being friendly (hospitable) to outsiders. Friendship is covenantal and implies a deeper commitment to one another than just being friendly. Proverbs 18:24 says: “Some ‘friends’ pretend to be friends, but a true friend sticks closer than a brother.” One can, however, be friendly to a person who is a mere acquaintance – not a brother, not a friend, and one who is even an enemy. In my opinion, the Hebrews 13 requirement that we be friendly to outsiders should be understood to mean people outside of faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 2 Corinthians 6:14 says: “Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers. For how can righteousness and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have with darkness?” For that reason, some would say that the Hebrews 13 Scripture means that we cannot have friendships outside of faith in Yeshua and the New Testament. I am, however, of the opinion that, unlike the covenant of marriage, the biblical covenant of friendship can be achieved so long as both parties believe in, and adhere to, the principles taught in the Tanakh . Now, why the emphasis on being friendly to outsiders? It is because we are responsible for sharing the Good News of Yeshua to those who do not know him as Messiah and, without being friendly to outsiders, we cannot minister to people who are outside the faith. As for the reference in Hebrews 13 to entertaining angels, I believe it is referring to people who have been specially blessed to have had an encounter with God.'

  title: Not Calling Any Person Common or Unclean.
  commandment: We are not to call any person common or unclean.
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are several ways that we can be indebted to another person – some financial and some non-financial. In early days, unpaid debts were generally paid by the debtor working off his debt as an indentured servant. A person who owed a debt was not free of his work obligation until the debt was paid. In the mid nineteenth century, debtor’s prisons substantially replaced the practice of indentured servitude in the western world, and today, while there are no longer debtor’s prisons, owing a debt that one cannot pay nevertheless results in a bondage of obligation that God does not want us to have. That is why Romans 13:8 instructs us: “Don''t owe anyone anything- except to love one another.” In today’s world, buying on credit for personal or business reasons is commonplace, which raises the question as to whether it is permissible for believers to borrow money or acquire property or services for which payment is deferred. The answer is complex because of the various kinds of loans and circumstances that exist. In general, I would say that collateralized loans are not biblically prohibited. Because the collateral is there to repay the loan should the lender not be able to repay it, a true debt (ie. an obligation without means of repayment) never really exists. I am of the opinion that, except for debt incurred in emergencies and for humanitarian reasons, unsecured debt with no clear means of repayment is what Romans 13:8 prohibits. The stated exception “to love one another” actually requires that we lend to people (especially to brothers) who are in need even when there is a risk of the loan not being repaid (see “Supportive Tanakh Scriptures” supra, and “Related Mitzvot in Volumes 1 & 2” infra). Typical of the kind of debt we are not to incur is that which is created by the elective use of credit cards where the borrower has no immediate means of repayment. Our desire to have things that are not necessary and that we cannot afford is what most often lures us into financial bondage, and is what Romans 13:8 is mostly speaking against.'

  title: Not Sinning Against Our Brother or Neighbor.
  commandment: We are not to sin against our brother or neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: 'There are many Scriptures telling us that God is the source of our comfort, 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 being one of them: “Praised be God, Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, compassionate Father, God of all encouragement and comfort; who encourages us in all our trials, so that we can encourage others in whatever trials they may be undergoing with the encouragement we ourselves have received from God.” Why, therefore, are there Scriptures that require that we comfort one another? It is because we are created in God’s image and are therefore to love our neighbor as God loves us and taught us how ( 1 John 4:19) . We live in a fallen world and are therefore subject to pain, anguish, disappointment, broken-heartedness, grief, and more. God wants us to overcome in the face of these, and He uses our comfort of each other as one of the ways that He empowers us to do so. The key Scripture supporting this Mitzvah speaks to counselors, but since comforting by sharing God’s word is the responsibility of all believers, the authors herein consider that Romans 12:8 is applicable to us all. Caveat One must be careful not to comfort another in a manner that endorses or enables the continuation of sinful behavior.'

  title: Comforting Our Neighbor.
  commandment: We are to comfort our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah , to not deceive our neighbor, is an obvious extension of the Mitzvah to love our neighbor. There are, nevertheless, exceptions; they are when deception is allowed or even used by God to achieve godly ends such as saving a life, testing us, or avoiding injustice. One such case is in Genesis 20:2 where, in order to protect his wife Sarah, Abraham lied to Avimelekh, telling him that Sarah was his sister. Another case is Joshua 2:1 (and verses following), where Y’hoshua son of Num secretly sent spies to inspect land in the vicinity of (and including) Yericho in order to determine if it was safe for the Israelites to go there. A third case is in 1 Samuel 19:13-17 where, in order to prevent Saul from killing David, Michal told Saul that David was sick, whereas the truth was that David had escaped and was fleeing. God warns us against spiritual deception, but He sometimes allows it in order to test us. Such was the case where God allowed Satan to tempt and deceive Eve, and Eve did likewise to Adam. They failed the test, and we are paying for it.

  title: Not Harboring Bitterness, Malice, Meanness or Spitefulness
  commandment: We are not to harbor bitterness, malice, meanness or spitefulness against our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: 'One might ask how this Mitzvah “bear one another’s burdens” squares with Galatians 6:5: “.. for each person will carry his own load. ” The answer is that the words translated “ burdens ” in Galatians 6:2 and “ load ” in Galatians 6:5 are different Greek words. The Greek word “ bare ” in Galatians 6:2 is something extremely heavy and burdensome, whereas the word “ phortion ” in Galatians 6:5 is a soldier’s pack of the kind that one person should be able to carry easily. Conceivably, the burdens referred to in this Mitzvah could apply to things physically heavy, but that is not its main intent. Its intent is for us to assist our fellow man as he encounters the various burdens of life. The New Testament Scriptures listed above illustrate this by exhorting us to be kind to one another, pray for one another, correct one another, serve each other’s needs, etc. Yeshua illustrated this in Luke 11:46 where he chastised the experts in law: " Woe to you Torah experts too! You load people down with burdens they can hardly bear, and you won''t lift a finger to help them! ” In our attempting to comply with this Mitzvah , we must remember that we cannot do it alone and must rely on God. Matthew 11:29-30 puts it this way: “ Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. "'

  title: Bearing One Another’s Burdens.
  commandment: We are to bear one another’s burdens.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Whereas the word “bear” in Mitzvah #DA11 means to “carry” (as in a load), in this Mitzvah it means to “endure.” and “put up with.” We live in a world shared by others; some we like, and some we do not. Some get on our nerves, and others do not. The fact of they’re just being different from us can cause us stress, irritation, and even anger at times, but Scripture is clear that we are to love them all, and unconditionally forgive any sin they commit against us. 27'

  title: Not Provoking Our Neighbor.
  commandment: We are not to provoke our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: 'In the Tanakh , outsiders (also referred to as strangers or foreigners) were not merely Gentiles; they were Gentiles who lived outside the community of Israel. Gentiles who lived within the Community may have been gerim toshav (resident aliens or Tikkun’s terminology K’rovei Yisrael ). They were not considered outsiders, and could even partake of the Passover sacrifice if they were circumcised (Exodus 12:43-49 ). Under the Mosaic Covenant, outsiders had to be treated with love and respect, but Israelites did not have the same brotherly obligation of providing for their needs as they did for other Israelites, and could even lend to them at interest. Under the New Covenant, Gentile believers in Yeshua are grafted into the olive tree of Israel ( Romans 11:16-1 7) and are therefore brothers in the faith with Jewish believers; they are not considered outsiders even if they do not reside within a Jewish Community. This Mitzvah and Colossians 4: 5-6 instruct believers in Yeshua to act wisely in their contacts and conversations with outsiders (unbelievers) in order to make “full use of every opportunity.” The Scripture does not say to what opportunities it is referring, but we assume from the context that they are opportunities to share both God and Yeshua with unbelievers. The Scripture also does not indicate to what wise acts it is referring other than conversations, and rightfully so, because each encounter with an unbeliever presents its own challenges. Naturally, we must act civilly and lovingly, but we must also seek the Holy Spirit so that the Spirit’s wisdom becomes our wisdom.'

  title: Behaving Wisely Toward Outsiders.
  commandment: We are to behave wisely toward outsiders.
  commentary_rudolph: 'From Volumes 1 and 2: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” is the well-known “golden rule,” but it does not appear in the Bible in that form. What is in the Bible is Mark 12:30-31 , which states: “.. and you are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your understanding and with all your strength.'' The second is this: ''You are to love your neighbor as yourself.'' There is no other mitzvah greater than these.” Applying that principle, Scripture teaches that we have a duty to help others, even to try to save the life of a person who is attacked. What is unclear is whether the duty applies even if it puts the protector in danger and, because Scripture is silent on the matter, I will not speculate. The parable of the “good Samaritan” is the classic Scripture that lauds assisting a person who has been attacked, but it is noteworthy that at no time was the “good Samaritan” in danger since he gave his help after the attack on the injured man had occurred. Nevertheless, he helped the stranger in need by spending his own time and money. Interestingly, some U.S. States have adopted what they call the “Good Samaritan Law” which does not require that a bystander help a person who is in distress, but states that if he does and causes injury in the process, he cannot be sued for his attempt.'

  commentary_rudolph: To scoff is to scorn or mock in a derisive way. The prohibition of this Mitzvah is scoffing about things of God such as his existence, his character, his triunity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), inspiration of the Scriptures, etc.). Unbelievers are not necessarily mockers. We can have limited fellowship with unbelievers and even admit them to our congregational meetings (so long as they are not disruptive), but we are not to allow or receive mockers.

  title: Guarding Against Scoffers.
  commandment: We are to guard against scoffers.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Minding our own business, meddling, and not being busy bodies are the same. A colloquial way of saying it is “Don’t poke your nose where it does not belong.” Scripture is not, however, saying that we should never know of our neighbor’s affairs. In fact, Philippians 2:4 commands us to: “ look out for each other''s interests and not just for your own ,” and we cannot do that without knowing something of our neighbor’s affairs – what he is going through and what are his needs. There are times when our neighbor’s affairs should be solely his own and not be probed into, and there are times when our neighbor may not want something of his affairs known but, out of love and a desire to help, we should seek to know. We must seek the Holy Spirit for wisdom so as not to intrude unnecessarily and yet be open to giving help when it is needed and appropriate.'

  commentary_rudolph: 'To the extent that we can avoid it, we are not to be financially dependent on others. We are to work diligently to earn our living and ideally even have enough to assist a brother who may fall on hard times. If, due to no fault of our own, it is we who fall on hard times we should not hesitate to accept help if it is offered. The principle of this Mitzvah does not condone our putting our hope in wealth, for 1 Timothy 6:17 tells us: “As for those who do have riches in this present world, charge them not to be proud and not to let their hopes rest on the uncertainties of riches but to rest their hopes on God, who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment. Charge them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous and ready to share. In this way they will treasure up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may lay hold of the real life.”'

  title: Living So as Not to Be Financially Dependent on Others.
  commandment: We are to live so as not to be financially dependent on others.
  commentary_rudolph: This Mitzvah has both a physical and a spiritual component. The Tanakh supports (even promotes) the pain and humiliation of spanking as a tool (available among others) for correcting our children but not to the extent of harming them. Spanking children to punish them or to dispense justice (e.g. for disobedience) is not addressed in Scripture, and physical pain of any kind must not to be applied while a parent is excessively angry or out of control. That is why we recommend caressing our child and expressing love after delivering a spanking. The Kitvey B’rit Chadashah does not address spanking, but prohibits harming children by misleading them (ensnaring them in sin). It also warns us against unnecessarily and unreasonably irritating our children and causing them to resent us.

  commandment: We are not to mislead or harm a child.
  commentary_rudolph: Although the defined subject of 1 Timothy 5:1-2 is having respect for a person that we are rebuking, 1 Peter 2:17 and others in the Tanakh suggest that its intended application is broader. There are different ways of treating people with respect according to whether the people are older or younger or male or female. Men do not treat women as they do other men, nor do women treat men as they do other women. Similarly, adults do not treat each other as they would children, and children should show respect to adults differently than they do to their peers. Similar regarding those in authority and those subordinate to them. Also, because we are part of God’s family, we have family responsibilities of giving love one to the other. We are therefore to relate to significantly older people as to parents, significantly younger people as to children, and peers as to brothers and sisters.

  commentary_rudolph: 'We are able to study Scripture and pray alone, but Scripture is emphatic that we assemble with the brethren. It does not say how, when, or how long, but clearly not never. The reason is that we have been created to be in relationship to each other, and our relationship to God is not only person to person, but also corporate. Matthew 18:19-20 explains it this way: “To repeat, I tell you that if two of you here on earth agree about anything people ask, it will be for them from my Father in heaven. For wherever two or three are assembled in my name, I am there with them."'

  title: Not Neglecting to Assemble with the Brethren.
  commandment: We are not to neglect to assemble with the brethren.
  commentary_rudolph: On its surface, this Mitzvah “Not Showing Favoritism” seems intuitive but can, on occasion, be misunderstood. First, favoritism applies to people –not to favorite foods, possessions, experiences, etc. Second, favoritism implies partiality that is improper such as promoting a less qualified person over one who is more highly qualified, in order to acquire some personal gain. When we favor one person over another for right reasons. we do not call it favoritism. If I, as a supervisor, favor one of my staff over another for a task for which he is especially well suited, that is good management – not favoritism. If I choose to spend more time with my son than with an unrelated person, that is good fathering – not favoritism. On the other hand, if I appoint my son to a position over a better qualified person merely because he is my son, that is showing favoritism. On the other hand (I think I have run out of hands), if the position is in a family- owned business in which everyone’s expectation is that my son is the heir apparent, then favoritism in my son’s behalf is both expected and appropriate, and this Mitzvah would not apply.

  title: Not Showing Favoritism.
  commandment: We are not to show favoritism.
  commentary_rudolph: 'This Mitzvah is referred to in Jewish literature as “ lashon hara ” – evil speech. Slander is a form of lashon hara but differs from it (at least in contemporary usage) in that lashon hara is any pejorative speech about someone (true or not) whereas slander is pejorative speech that is untrue. 28 Gossip is lashon hara only if the information being spread is negative. The above-referenced Scriptures have to do with the speaking of lashon hara , but what about giving a willing ear to it? I suggest that listening to lashon hara is also sinful – not with the tongue but with the ear – and perhaps is even more sinful than speaking it because the one who willfully listens to lashon hara becomes an enabler and a contributor to the sin of the one who speaks it. Here are two Scriptures that clearly show God’s attitude toward those who listen to the lashon hara of gossip: Proverbs 16:27 A worthless person digs up evil [gossip] – it is like scorching fire on his lips. Proverbs 20:19 A gossip goes around revealing secrets, so don''t get involved with a talkative person. There are at least four exceptions to lashon hara . First, speaking negatively about a person is permitted when it is intended for the person’s good and is accompanied by godly wisdom and discretion. Miryam’s offense of murmuring against Moses in Numbers 12:1-10 was that she did not intend what she said to be for Moses’ good. Had she said instead .. “Aaron, I am worried about Moses because I think that marrying the Ethiopian woman was the wrong thing for him to do.” In the Hebrew Scriptures, “slander” is “rakiyl,” and in the Greek Scriptures it is “blasphemeo.” Translators use other English words for these as well (e.g. “talebearing”). her comment, while still critical of Moses, would have been intended for Moses’ good, and I do not believe she would not have been punished for what she said. The second exception to lashon hara is when our negative words about a person are meant for justice. A situation in which this occurs is when we give testimony against a person in a beit din or a secular court of law. Deuteronomy 19:15 anticipates this through its instruction: “One witness alone will not be sufficient to convict a person of any offense or sin of any kind; the matter will be established only if there are two or three witnesses testifying against him.” The third exception to lashon hara is when our negative words about a person are in response to our having a special responsibility to speak. An example would be reporting a crime or the abuse of a child, or a juror deliberating with other jurors. Sha’ul himself made statements that would be considered lashon hara had he not been imbued with special apostolic responsibility for the congregations he was overseeing; consider, for example, his comments about his fellow shaliach Kefa: Galatians 2:11-13 Furthermore, when Kefa came to Antioch, I opposed him publicly, because he was clearly in the wrong. For prior to the arrival
    of certain people from [the community headed by] Ya''akov, he had been eating with the Gentile believers; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he was afraid of the faction who favored circumcising Gentile believers. And the other Jewish believers became hypocrites along with him, so that even Bar-Nabba was led astray by their hypocrisy.” Also, Sha’ul “names names” in 1 Timothy 1:19b-20: “By rejecting conscience, some have made shipwreck of their trust; among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I have turned them over to the Adversary, so that they will learn not to insult God.” The fourth exception to lashon hara is when a person who is privy to pejorative information about a person legitimately needs counsel as to what to do with the information or how to respond to it. Husbands and wives are not prohibited from confiding in each other, but sometimes it is best to seek advice from a counselor, or a pastor or mature believer who has no prior knowledge of the parties involved. All speech (both complementary and critical) has spiritual power and can be used for both good and bad. It can bring comfort and it can distress; it can bring blessing and it can harm. As believers, our witness of Yeshua to those who do not know him requires that we be different than unbelievers, and one of the most noticeable ways of our being different is how we speak and how we respond to others who speak. Ridding ourselves of lashon hara is not an option – it is a commandment that we must take seriously.'

  title: Not Speaking Badly or Critically of Our Brother or Neighbor.
  commandment: We are not to speak badly or critically of our brother or neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: Not insulting our neighbor is an obvious part of loving our neighbor as ourselves ( Mark 12:31) , But who determines what is an insult? Our neighbor? We are called by Matthew 18:15-17 to confront our neighbor when he has sinned against us and by Galatians 6:1 to correct one another “ in a spirit of humility .” It is not uncommon for a well-intentioned correction or other remark to be received as insulting regardless of how innocently it is spoken or how carefully we have chosen our words. We cannot be responsible for our neighbor’s reaction to what we say to him if what we say is said correctly. Our responsibility is to address our neighbor with loving intentions and words of respect as directed by the Holy Spirit. It is our neighbor’s responsibility to also hear the Holy Spirit and receive that which we say to him correctly and in the spirit we intend.

  commandment: We are not to harbor evil suspicions about our neighbor.
  commentary_rudolph: 'Having fellowship is one way of relating to a person, but it is not the only way. Not fellowshipping with ungodly people (per this Mitzvah ) means not participating with them in the ungodly aspects of their lives and their sinful pleasures. It does not mean that we are to have no contact with them for, as we read in 1 Corinthians 5:10: “ then you would have to leave the world altogether! ” Not only that, but if we have no contact, we will also have no opportunity to preach the Word of God to them which is also a Mitzvah . Marriage is of course the most intimate fellowship that one can have, so this Mitzvah has implications as to who a believer can or cannot marry. The subject of unequal yoking in marriage is is dealt with in Mitzvah # GB01.'

  commentary_rudolph: Being hospitable is treating a person who visit us or dwells with us with kindness and consideration. Being welcoming is related but not the same. We can be hospitable to a person and even say “Welcome!,” but he is not really welcome if our show of hospitality has no joy and is out of obligation only. Being truly welcoming means that we are happy that the person is with us, and are happy to show him hospitality.
