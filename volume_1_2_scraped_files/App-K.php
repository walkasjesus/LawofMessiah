Whereas New Covenant Scriptures are liberally cited in support of
<i>Mitzvot</i> elsewhere in this book, this Appendix lists those words of
Yeshua in the Book of Matthew that can reasonably be considered commandments.
Some of these are unique, and some are repeats of <i>mitzvot</i> given
earlier through Moses.
