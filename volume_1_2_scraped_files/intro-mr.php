The Bible can be appreciated from many points of view. It may be thought of
as the biography of God in His dealings with mankind. It may be read as a
treatise on the history of the world and, in particular, the history of
Israel and the heathen nations. It may also be studied as a prophetic book,
revealing our future here on earth and in eternity. In this work, however,
it is mainly presented as a book of <i>Torah law</i>, containing God's
instructions for holy, moral, and victorious living.

The term "Law of Messiah" appears only once in the Bible, and that is in
<u>Galatians 6:2</u>. That notwithstanding, the term is extremely
significant in signaling that there exists such a law, that it is related to
"<i>Torah</i>" and, as we shall see, that both it and "<i>Torah</i>" are
alive and well under the New Covenant.

The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament defines "<i>Torah</i>"
(<img src=images/word-torah-1.gif height=24 align=top> - Strong's number
8451) as follows<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>:
</p>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The word t&ocirc;r&acirc; means basically &quot;teaching&quot; whether it is
the wise man instructing his son or God instructing Israel. The wise give
insight into all aspects of life so that the young may know how to conduct
themselves and to live a long blessed life (<u>Prov 3:1 f.</u>). So too God,
motivated by love, reveals to man basic insight into how to live with each
other and how to approach God. Through the law God shows his interest in all
aspects of man's life which is to be lived under his direction and care. Law
of God stands parallel to word of the Lord to signify that law is the
revelation of God's will (e.g. <u>Isa 1:10</u>). In this capacity it becomes
the nation's wisdom and understanding so that others will marvel at the
quality of Israel's distinctive life style (<u>Deut 4:6</u>). Thus there is a
very similar understanding of the role of teaching with its results in the
wisdom school, in the priestly instruction, and the role of the law with its
results for all the people of the covenant.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Specifically law refers to any set of regulations; e.g., <u>Exo 12</u>
contains the law in regard to observing the Passover; some other specific
laws include those for the various offerings (<u>Lev 7:37</u>), for leprosy
(<u>Lev 14:57</u>) and for jealousy (<u>Num 5:29</u>). In this light law is
often considered to consist of statutes, ordinances, precepts, commandments,
and testimonies.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The meaning of the word gains further perspective in the light of
<u>Deut</u>. According to <u>Deut 1:5</u> Moses sets about to explain the
law; law here would encompass the moral law, both in its apodictic and
casuistic formulation, and the ceremonial law. The genius of <u>Deut</u> is
that it interprets the external law in the light of its desired effect on
man's inner attitudes. In addition, the book of <u>Deut</u> itself shows
that the law has a broad meaning to encompass history, regulations and their
interpretation, and exhortations. It is not merely the listing of casuistic
statements as is the case in Hammurabi's code. Later the word extended to
include the first five books of the Bible in all their variety.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In addition, The <u>New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew and English
Lexicon</u> gives "direction, instruction,
law"<sup><small><a name=fr2 href=#fn2>2</a></small></sup>
as the primary definitions of "<i>Torah</i>", and the <u>Encyclopaedia
Judaica</u>
states:<sup><small><a name=fr3 href=#fn3>3</a></small></sup>

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Torah</i> is derived from the root <img src=images/word-yarah-1.gif
height=20 align=top> which in the <i>hifil</i> conjugation means "to teach"
(cf. <u>Lev. 10:11</u>). The meaning of the word is therefore "teaching",
"doctrine", or "instructions"; the commonly accepted "law" gives a wrong
impression. The word is used in different ways but the underlying idea of
"teaching" is common to all.

There are basically two ways in which "<i>Torah</i>" is used in the
<i>Tanakh</i>. In one usage, "<i>Torah</i>" refers to "the Law" - God's legal
code which provides instructions on specific matters. Examples of this usage
are:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"This is the <b><i>Torah</i></b> of the burnt offering..." (<u>Leviticus</u>
<u>6:2(9)ff</u>);<sup><small><a name=fr4 href=#fn4>4</a></small></sup>
"grain offering..." (<u>Leviticus 6:7(14)ff</u>); "sin offering..."
(<u>Leviticus 6:18(25)ff)</u>; "trespass offering..." (<u>Leviticus
7:1ff</u>); "peace offering..." (<u>Leviticus 7:11ff</u>); "leprous
plague..." (<u>Leviticus 13:59ff</u>); "jealousy..." (<u>Numbers 5:29ff</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In most instances, however, "<i>Torah</i>" refers broadly to God's teaching -
His universal and eternal standard for conduct and life. Where "<i>Torah</i>"
means "law", it is usually accompanied by other Hebrew words having to do
with law, such as:

I hope by now the reader is convinced that the New Covenant is a covenant of
<i>Torah</i> - God's teaching written on our hearts. Now let us see if any
of the New Covenant books are <i>Torah</i> analogous to the
<i>Pentateuch</i>. If the test for "<i>pentateuchal</i>" <i>Torah</i> is
whether a New Covenant book of the Bible contains the New Covenant itself -
that is, the "<i>Torah</i>" put in our minds and written on our hearts -
then the Gospel books - Mathew, Mark, Luke and John certainly pass the test.
Consider the many similarities between the <i>Pentateuch</i> and the Gospels:
</font></p><ol style="margin-left:30px">

The Gospels collectively contain the life of Yeshua, who was used by God to
deliver the New Covenant to Israel (<u>Hebrews 8:6</u>).
<br><br></font></li>
<li><font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The <i>Pentateuch</i> contains the event in which Moses proclaims the blood

<br><br></font></li>
<li><font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The <i>Pentateuch</i> contains the teachings and the commandments of the

<br><br></font></li>
<li><font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The <i>Pentateuch</i> initiates a priesthood and the appointment of Aaron

its fulfillment. It is in the Gospel books that we find this New Covenant
substance, and therefore the New Covenant itself.

According to Rabbinical understanding, the Holy Scriptures are organized into
three parts - the <i>Torah</i> (<i>Pentateuch</i>, Law), the <i>Nevi'im</i>
(Prophets), and the <i>Ketuvim</i> (Holy
Writings)<sup><small><a name=fr16 href=#fn16>16</a></small></sup>.
Rabbinical Judaism does not acknowledge the current existence of the "New
Covenant" prophesied in <u>Jeremiah 31:31(30)</u>, or the inspiration of the
New Covenant Scriptures. One of the ways that Judaism has historically
viewed "<i>Torah</i>" has been as synonymous with the Law of Moses - the law
to which it considers itself bound today. Its further understanding is that
all of the Mosaic Law is contained in "the <i>Torah</i>" (Pentateuch), and
that all remaining Scriptures of the <i>Tanakh</i>, while inspired, merely
historicize, exemplify, and embellish. Consequently, Rabbinical Judaism
devotes most of its attention to the "<i>Torah</i>" and to the oral tradition
(<i>Talmud</i>), to which it looks for interpretation.

<p align=left style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=2>
<a name=fn16 href=#fr16>16.</a>
This categorization, to wit, <i>Torah</i>,
<i>Nevi&#039;im</i> and <i>Ketuvim</i>, has resulted in the Rabbinical
canon of the Bible being known by the acronym <i>Tanakh</i>. It is
noteworthy that Yeshua Himself referred to Scripture by these categories
(<u>Luke 24:44</u>).

The Commandments contained in the <i>Tanakh</i> are God's explicit directives
and are, therefore, divine statutory
law<sup><small><a name=fr17 href=#fn17>17</a></small></sup>.
There are two categories of statutes commanded by God under the Mosaic
Covenant - those whose literal compliance depends upon the Covenant's
continued existence, and those whose literal compliance does not. I call the
first of these, "covenant-dependent", and the second of these,
"covenant-transcendent". Recognizing these two categories is important,
because the Book of Hebrews teaches:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Hebrews 8:13</u>: <i>By using the term, 'new', he has made the first
covenant 'old'; and something being made old, something in the process of
aging, is on its way to vanishing altogether.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Hebrews 8:13</u> suggests a diminishing literal role for
covenant-dependent statutes; consequently, such statutes are not incorporated
into New Covenant law in their original form and application, while statutes
that are covenant-transcendent are readily adopted without
change<sup><small><a name=fr18 href=#fn18>18</a></small></sup>.
So, for example, the literal application of statutes dealing with the
Levitical priesthood, the Temple, and the government of ancient Israel, are
in the process of vanishing (or have already
vanished<sup><small><a name=fr19 href=#fn19>19</a></small></sup>
as has the Mosaic Covenant been vanishing, but the principles they teach
remain
important,<sup><small><a name=fr20 href=#fn20>20</a></small></sup>
and we must not ignore them.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Romans 7:6</u>: <i>But now we have been released from this aspect of the
Torah, because we have died to that which had us in its clutches, so that we
are serving in the new way provided by the Spirit and not in the old way of
outwardly following the letter of the law.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is my opinion that "oldness of the letter", as some translations read,
refers to the diminishing role of covenant-dependent statutes as literal law,
whereas our need for literal obedience to covenant-transcendent statutes
(e.g. <u>Exodus 20:1-17</u>) is timeless.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In the <i>Tanakh</i>, statutes are not labeled as "covenant-dependent" or
"covenant-transcendent", and so one must exercise judgment in determining
which is which. A rule-of-thumb test is to ask: "Can or should this statute
be complied with in the New Covenant era exactly and literally as commanded?"
If the answer is "yes", it is "transcendent". If "no", it is "dependent".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Sometimes, the answer to the above "test" question is obvious. No one would
disagree, for example, that it is as sinful to commit murder today, as in the
past. On the other hand, the question of whether Jews in the New Covenant
are still required to wear fringes on the corners of their garments
(<u>Numbers 15:38-41</u>), may evoke two opinions: (1) Yes, the original
reason for doing so still applies - to remind those who see the fringes of
the commandments of God, and (2) No, one can comply with the commandment's
principle by wearing an alternative item such as a necklace depicting two
tablets. In making such decisions for myself, I rely on the wisdom of a
saying that is not found in Scripture: "If it isn't broken, don't try to fix
it." So, if the literal commandment is as appropriately performable today as
during the time of Moses, then I do not search for an alternative.

The author does not believe that the temple,
priesthood, and statutes prophesied in <u>Ezekiel 40-48</u> indicate a
revitalization of the Mosaic Covenant. This is because (1) The priests
serving in that temple are limited to the sons of Zadok, (2) the High Priest
in that temple is "the prince" - not the sons of Aaron - and (3)
revitalization of the Mosaic Covenant would contradict <u>Hebrews 8:13</u>.
That being the case, the statutes appearing in the <u>Ezekiel chapters</u>
are, even when similar to Mosaic statutes, newly enacted and not
continuations of those in the Mosaic Covenant.

broadly defined as His essential
teaching<sup><small><a name=fr21 href=#fn21>21</a>,<a name=fr22 href=#fn22>22</a></small></sup>.
Although not all <i>Torah</i> is statutory in origin, all <i>torah</i> is
God's law because it is the essence of His will. Even if a commandment is
covenant-dependent, its <i>torah</i> transcends the change in covenant
because God's values never change (<u>Numbers 23:19</u>; <u>Psalm

I capitalize "<i>Torah</i>" and sometimes I do not and write it
"<i>torah.</i>" It is just my way of indicating whether I am speaking of
God's teaching generically or more specifically as His law (or do I mean

and brought them out of the land of Egypt; because they, for their part,
violated my covenant, even though I, for my part, was a husband to them,'
says Adonai. For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra'el
after those days,' says Adonai: 'I will put my Torah within them and write it
on their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer
will any of them teach his fellow community member or his brother, 'Know
Adonai'; for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
because I will forgive their wickednesses and remember their sins no
more.'</i>

We have seen that there are two components of Law in the <i>Tanakh</i> that
are eternal; they are (1) covenant-transcendent statutes, and (2)
<i>Torah</i> (teaching) that is revealed through all Scripture. Since, by
definition, covenant-dependent statutes vanish along with their vanishing
covenant, it is the covenant-transcendent statutes, plus all <i>Torah</i>
contained in the <i>Tanakh</i>, plus all law added by the New Covenant
Scriptures, which form the "Law of Messiah" to which we are accountable
today. Hence, the Law of Messiah is the New Covenant counterpart of the Law
of Moses.

As used in this book, a "<i>dibeyr</i>" is an explicit commandment of God in
Scripture - an imperative directive (usually a statute or ordinance of the
Mosaic Law) which may be either covenant-dependent or transcendent.
"<i>Torah</i>" can mean several things but, in the absence of the article
"the" (e.g. "the <i>Torah</i>"), it most often means God's essential and
eternal teaching or instruction. As used in this book, <i>Torah</i>
underlies all of God's
<i>dibrot</i>,<sup><small><a name=fr29 href=#fn29>29</a></small></sup>
and is revealed (explicitly or implicitly) by all Scripture - not just the
Scriptures of the <i>Pentateuch</i>. A "<i>Mitzvah</i>" is an interpreted
statement of God's will, derived from Scripture, and expressed in the form of
a commandment. A Mosaic statute or ordinance does not become a
<i>mitzvah</i> (as used herein) until it is interpreted and restated.

There have been several attempts in history to codify God's Word into
numbered
<i>mitzvot</i><sup><small><a name=fr30 href=#fn30>30</a></small></sup>.
The earliest of these was <i>Hilchot Gedolot</i>, a work by Simon Kairo
published sometime in the 8<sup><small>th</small></sup> century. By that
time, a principle had already been established in the <i>Talmud</i>, that the
total number of <i>mitzvot</i> in the <i>Torah</i> was <i>Taryag</i>
(613)<sup><small><a name=fr31 href=#fn31>31</a></small></sup>;
and of these, two hundred forty-eight (248) were positive (<i>mitzvot
aseh</i>), and three hundred sixty-five (365) were negative (<i>mitzvot

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Anyone who attempts to enumerate <i>mitzvot</i> in the <i>Torah</i> soon
realizes that there are decisions to be made. What, for example, should one
consider to be a
<i>mitzvah</i>?<sup><small><a name=fr33 href=#fn33>33</a></small></sup>
What level of departure from the plain meaning of the Biblical text is
permissible? What level of inference is allowable? How does one count
similar expressions of God's will that are stated differently at different
places in the Scriptures? Do we count as two <i>mitzvot</i>, those that are
expressed both in the positive and in the negative in different verses of
Scripture, or do we count them as one? It is not surprising that those who
have attempted this work have sometimes come to different conclusions.

To bring consensus, Judaism needed a scholar of such prestige that he could
define 613 <i>mitzvot</i> that would be acceptable to a majority of the
Jewish community. Such a scholar emerged in the person of Moshe ben Maimon
(Maimonides, aka "the RAMABAM") who, sometime prior to 1170 c.e., wrote his
compilation of <i>Torah</i> law in Arabic under the title <i><u>Kitab
Al-Fara'id</u></i> (<u>The Book of Divine Precepts</u>). He subsequently
revised his work and so, by the end of his life, there were two Arabic texts
or versions of <i><u>Kitab Al-Fara'id</u></i> in existence. Unlike his
predecessors, Maimonides was careful to follow defined principles (fourteen)
to justify his conclusions. This made all the difference, and his work
received almost universal
acceptance<sup><small><a name=fr34 href=#fn34>34</a></small></sup>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Three contemporaries of Maimonides translated his texts into Hebrew, and
these translations became known as <i>Sefer haMitzvot</i>. Abraham ibn
Chasdai made his translation from Maimonides' first
version<sup><small><a name=fr35 href=#fn35>35</a></small></sup>.
Maimonides' second text (translated into Hebrew by Solomon ibn Job of Granada
and separately by Moses ibn Tibbon) is, however, considered the "standard
Arabic text" today. More recently, Dr. Chaim Heller published a "corrected"
Hebrew text in which he compared and reconciled Maimonides' Arabic texts with
that of ibn Job, and an even more recent translation (Jerusalem Hebrew Text)
was made by Rabbi Joseph Kapach.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
As an academic achievement, Maimonides' enumeration of <i>mitzvot</i> was
huge. However, it was too exhaustive to be a convenient tool in the
post-Temple era, when many of the <i>mitzvot</i> dealing with sacrifices and
the Levitical priesthood could no longer be performed.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Enter Rabbi Yisrael Meir
haKohen<sup><small><a name=fr36 href=#fn36>36</a></small></sup>.
In 1931, Rabbi Meir published <i>Sefer haMitzvot haKatzar</i> (The Concise
Book of
<i>Mitvoth</i>)<sup><small><a name=fr37 href=#fn37>37</a></small></sup>,
in which he extracted from Maimonides' list, Two Hundred Ninety Seven (297)
<i>mitzvot</i> - Seventy-seven (77) positive, One Hundred Ninety-four (194)
negative, and Twenty-six (26) applicable only in the Land of Israel. Rabbi
Meir intended his book to be a compilation of <i>mitzvot</i> that could be
observed by Jews in the post-Temple era and, particularly in the Diaspora.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Besides listing fewer <i>mitzvot</i> than Maimonides, Rabbi Meir differs from
him in other ways as well. To begin with, the two compilers number their
<i>mitzvot</i> differently and present them in a different order. As a
consequence, it is not always easy to determine which one of Meir's
<i>mitzvot</i> corresponds to a given <i>mitzvah</i> of Maimonides. Second,
while they usually agree on the Scriptures that define a given
<i>mitzvah</i>, it is not always the case (nor is it the case with other
commentators). It is also important to note that, while both Maimonides and
Meir quote Hebrew Scripture as proof texts for their respective
<i>mitzvot</i>, neither of their original writings give supportive chapter
and verse numbers<sup><small><a name=fr38 href=#fn38>38</a>,<a name=fr39 href=#fn39>39</a></small></sup>
and their quotations are not always of the entire verses as they appear in
modern Hebrew Bibles. Translators and editors of both their works added
chapter and verse citations that did not appear in the
originals<sup><small><a name=fr40 href=#fn40>40</a></small></sup>
and, in some cases, they quoted entire verses of Scripture where the original
writings quoted only parts of
verses<sup><small><a name=fr41 href=#fn41>41</a></small></sup>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Finally, Maimonides and Meir do not always agree on the statement of the
<i>mitzvah</i> that they extract from a given Scripture. For example, in
response to <u>Exodus 12:18</u>, Maimonides' Positive <i>Mitzvah</i> #RP158
states that we are to eat unleavened bread on the evening of the
15<sup><small>th</small></sup> day of <i>Nisan</i>, while Meir's Positive
<i>Mitzvah</i> #MP23 states that we are to eat unleavened bread on the
evening of the 14<sup><small>th</small></sup> day of <i>Nisan</i>.
Presumably, the interpretive difference is in whether "evening" is understood
to be before or after sundown. Another example is presented by
<u>Deuteronomy 6:13</u>. The Scripture itself states that we are to "fear the
LORD your God and serve Him". That notwithstanding, Maimonides' Positive
<i>Mitzvah</i> #RP5 interprets it as "worshipping" God, while Rabbi Meir's
Positive <i>Mitzvah</i> #MP7 says it means to "pray" to God. Clearly, the
ways the two compilers interpret Scripture and write their respective
<i>mitzvot</i> reflect both their judgment and their theology.

Codifications written after <i><u>Sefer haMitzvot</u></i> have added to our
overall understanding of God's commandments, but no other codifier ever
attained the prestige and influence of Maimonides. As already stated,
Yisrael Meir haKohen's work, <i><u>Sefer haMitzvot haKatzar</i></u>, was
chosen here as a major comparison to Maimonides because he attempted to limit
his list of commandments to those he deemed performable in the Twentieth
Century. Although a complete listing and in-depth discussion of other law

<i><u>Mishneh Torah</u></i>, written by Maimonides, is a fourteen-book

to be complete, taking no account of a law's applicability in the
post-Temple era. Maimonides built the <i><u>Mishneh Torah</u></i> work
around his <i><u>Sefer haMitzvot</u></i>, so he reiterated all the
<i>mitzvot</i> in an introductory
list<sup><small><a name=fr42 href=#fn42>42</a></small></sup>,
and the relevant ones again before each of the fourteen books. The
relevance of <i><u>Mishneh Torah</u></i> for the present work is for its

<i><u>Sefer HaChinuch</u></i> (The Book of Education) is attributed to
Aaron haLevi of Barcelona (c. 1257) and is still in common use today. It
was most probably based upon Abraham ibn Chasdai's translation of
Maimonides' first Arabic edition and, although basically organized
according to the chapter and verse sequence of the
<i>Tanakh</i><sup><small><a name=fr43 href=#fn43>43</a></small></sup>,
his first manuscript retained some positive and negative commandment
groupings as part of its order. In contrast, the <i><u>Sefer
HaChinuch</u></i> version that is in print today contains none of the
positive/negative groupings. This is the result (according to Charles
Wengrov<sup><small><a name=fr44 href=#fn44>44</a></small></sup>)
of an early printer's decision to reorder the <i>mitzvot</i>, causing them
to appear in exactly the same sequence as the verses in the <i>Tanakh</i>;
and so it remains today. The importance of <i><u>Sefer HaChinuch</u></i>
for the present work, besides its order and historical content, is its

For Messianic Jews and <i>Torah</i>-adherent Gentile believers (followers of
Messiah Yeshua), neither Maimonides', nor Meir's, nor HaChinuch's works are a
sufficient guide for daily conduct and for relating to
God<sup><small><a name=fr45 href=#fn45>45</a></small></sup>.
It is because these believers acknowledge the continuing priesthood of
Yeshua, look to regular communication with the <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> for
personal guidance, including for applying
Scripture<sup><small><a name=fr46 href=#fn46>46</a></small></sup>,
and seek to be obedient to additional <i>Torah</i> contained in the <i>Kitvey
B'rit Chadasha</i> (the New Testament
Scriptures)<sup><small><a name=fr47 href=#fn47>47</a></small></sup>
- all part of a New Covenant between God and the Jewish
people<sup><small><a name=fr48 href=#fn48>48</a></small></sup>.
Jews who do not acknowledge New Covenant realities have no sacrifice for sin,
no benefits of an interceding priesthood, and therefore their approach to God
is necessarily more limiting. That notwithstanding, New Covenant believers
(both Jews and Gentiles) have the same need as Rabbinical Jews for a handy
compilation of Scripture-based <i>mitzvot</i> to assist them in their walk of
obedience.

This verse of Scripture is sometimes wrongly generalized to mean that all
the commandments of <i>Torah</i> are applicable to Jews and Gentiles in the
same way. This is a mistaken view because the context of this Scripture is
of the sojourner who desired to eat the <i>Pesach</i> and thus needed to be
circumcised.

The matter of proper application of Scripture looms very large. I have
approached this work prayerfully, and my interpretations are derived from my
sincere attempt to receive the wisdom of God through the <i>Ruach
HaKodesh</i>. I began with the <i>mitzvot</i> promulgated by Rabbi Yisrael
Meir HaKohen (the Chafetz Chaiyim) in his <i><u>Sefer haMitzvot
haKatzar</u></i><sup><small><a name=fr51 href=#fn51>51</a></small></sup>,
determined which <i>mitzvot</i> in Maimonides&#039;<sup><small><a name=fr52 href=#fn52>52</a>,<a name=fr53 href=#fn53>53</a></small></sup>,
and
HaChinuch&#039;s<sup><small><a name=fr54 href=#fn54>54</a></small></sup>
compilations corresponded, and then compared each of them with the Scriptures
they were intended to interpret. As a final step, I consulted a third
translator of
Maimonides<sup><small><a name=fr55 href=#fn55>55</a></small></sup>,
as well as New Covenant Scriptures that appeared relevant. Differences in
the chapter and verse citations among the various translated sources can be
explained by the fact that the translators and editors - not Maimonides,
Meir, or HaChinuch - placed them
there<sup><small><a name=fr56 href=#fn56>56</a></small></sup>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Not being bound by Talmudic authority, I did not attempt to arrive at
<i>Taryag</i> (613) <i>mitzvot</i> and I did not follow Maimonides' practice
of listing <i>mitzvot</i> in categories of positive and negative.
<i>Mitzvot</i> that addressed the same or similar issues were combined, and I
made independent judgments regarding their applications and preferred means
of expression. All of this was done in collaboration with Dr. Daniel C.
Juster whose comments are liberally included.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
After merging the work of Meir and Maimonides and eliminating duplications, I
reduced the resulting list by eliminating those <i>mitzvot</i> that I judged
to be not literally observable in the New
Covenant<sup><small><a name=fr57 href=#fn57>57</a></small></sup>.
For example, Meir's Positive <i>Mitzvah</i> #MP52 (Deuteronomy 18:4) requires
that we give the <i>kohen</i> (Levitical priest) the first wool of our sheep.
With the Mosaic Covenant in the process of vanishing away or having already
vanished (<u>Hebrews
8:13</u>)<sup><small><a name=fr58 href=#fn58>58</a></small></sup>,
I conclude that there is no longer a reason to support the Levitical
<i>kohanim</i> with such
gifts<sup><small><a name=fr59 href=#fn59>59</a></small></sup>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Although the New Covenant has rendered some of the Mosaic <i>mitzvot</i>
literally unobservable, it also produced new ones, and changed how some of
the Mosaic <i>mitzvot</i> are to be applied today. Consider, for example,
Meir's Positive <i>Mitzvah</i> #MP38 (<u>Leviticus 25:35-36</u> &
<u>Deuteronomy 15:8</u>), in which he states that we are to give charity to
the poor in Jewry. This limited interpretation was justified under the
Mosaic Covenant because the terms "brethren" and "brother" in
<u>Leviticus</u> referred only to fellow Israelites and <i>gerim</i>. Under
the New Covenant, however, our brethren include non-Jews of the faith grafted
to Israel as well (<u>Romans 11:16-19</u>), and so I broaden the
<i>mitzvah</i> to read: "We are to give <i>tz'dakah</i> (charity) to our poor
brethren who dwell among
us"<sup><small><a name=fr60 href=#fn60>60</a></small></sup>.

The author believes that after Yeshua&#039;s death
and prior to the 70 c.e. destruction, both the Mosaic and the New Covenant
existed simultaneously, but that after the destruction, it is likely that
the Mosaic Covenant, already in the process of vanishing away, finally came
to an end. Even if the Mosaic Covenant has not yet fully vanished, the
author&#039;s view is that we are to enthusiastically pursue where God is
leading - not dwell on what He is ending.

The organization of this book and the Scripture verses selected to support
each <i>mitzvah</i> are not necessarily the same as those of the classical
commentators and, similar to their respective works, no attempt is made to
reference every confirming Scripture. Indeed, some <i>mitzvot</i> are
included here that were not contemplated by the classical commentators - e.g.
<i>mitzvot</i> that are derived from parts of the <i>Tanakh</i> other than
the <i>Torah</i>, and <i>mitzvot</i> derived from the Apostolic Writings.
Also, I list some Scriptures merely because they are relied on by Maimonides
or Meir, and not necessarily because I deem them critical (or even logical)
for supporting a <i>mitzvah</i> under discussion. Finally, when I quote
Scripture, I quote entire verses even where Maimonides or Meir quote them
only in part, and even when I am only relying on part of a verse to prove or
support a <i>mitzvah</i>.

in addition to his own commentary, he includes extensive references to
classical rabbinical literature. Mainly, the order of his <i>mitzvot</i> are
the same as <i>HaChinuch's</i> - organized according to the Scripture order
of the <i>Tanakh</i> - and, when more than one Scripture is cited, it is the
first that governs the order; unfortunately, there are several occasions in
which the order of Chill's <i>mitzvot</i> depart from this plan, but the
reader is alerted where that happens. Chill's Scripture proof texts for the
various <i>mitzvot</i> he lists are more numerous and diverse than those of

Finally, I should like to say a word about usage. The writings of Meir,
Maimonides, HaChinuch, and my writings as well, are attempts at
interpretation, codification, explanation, and application of <i>mitzvot</i>
that we believe we have found in the Scriptures. Although we did not write
or compose (or intend to write or compose) any new commandments, this book
follows the common usage of saying that XYZ "wrote" <i>mitzvot</i>, or of
referring to one of our writings as "XYZ's <i>mitzvah</i>" when talking about
our compilations and explanations. I follow this convention of usage both
for the historical commentators as well as for myself within this book and by
doing so, no disrespect to God (from whom these <i>mitzvot</i> are derived)
is intended.

The Law of Messiah <i>Mitzvot</i> in this book are of two kinds; they are (1)
inclusive of one or more of the classical <i>mitzvot</i> (those from
Maimonides, Meir, or HaChinuch), or (2) completely unrelated to the classical
<i>mitzvot</i>. The classical <i>mitzvot</i> are based only upon Scriptures
from the <i>Torah</i>, whereas the <i>Mitzvot</i> written by the authors
herein are based upon Scriptures throughout the Bible. Those containing
Scripture references from the classical <i>mitzvah</i> compilations are
marked by an asterisk in the Table of Contents, and one or more of the
referenced Scriptures carry the label "Key Scriptures". In the
<i>Mitzvot</i> that are unrelated, their "Key Scriptures" are those that
appear to the authors as most relevant; these are not necessarily presented
in a canonical order.

The <i>mitzvot</i> which are the subject of this book derive from the
original biblical languages and not from any English or other translation.
Nevertheless, because this book was written with the English speaker in mind,
it was necessary that I select an English translation in which the Scriptures
being discussed could be displayed. I chose to use David H. Stern's 1998
translation known as the <u>Complete Jewish Bible</u>
(CJB)<sup><small><a name=fr64 href=#fn64>64</a></small></sup>
because, more than any other, it brings out the Jewish background and nuances
of the Scriptures, and this despite Dr. Stern himself stating:

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
So the <i>Tanakh</i> you have in this book is something between a translation
and a paraphrase; since it is partly one and partly the other, I refuse to
define it as either and instead call it simply a "version". On the other
hand, the books of the New Covenant are my translation from the original
Greek.<sup><small><a name=fr65 href=#fn65>65</a></small></sup>

This book has been written in collaboration with Dr. Daniel C. Juster. Dr.
Juster is a <i>shaliach</i> of <i>Tikkun</i>, an international network of
Messianic Jewish congregations, and he is the author of numerous books and
journal articles on Messianic Jewish theological and ministry subjects. In
some cases, Dr. Juster's commentary is labeled as his alone, but in many
cases, his and mine are integrated seamlessly.

The uniqueness of this book is not so much in its commentary (although I have
prayerfully sought God's wisdom while writing it), but in its utility as a
handbook and a framework for others to build upon. I am aware that there are
some who might criticize me for publishing my personal views and
interpretations of God's commandments, preferring that a work such as this be
undertaken by a plurality of scholars and with the authority of a community
behind it. In my defense, I will only say that this work is no different
than any other commentary on Scripture, most of which have been written by
individuals. Indeed, Maimonides himself came under criticism for not citing
Talmudic sources to support his application of rules for deciding which
<i>mitzvot</i> to
codify<sup><small><a name=fr66 href=#fn66>66</a></small></sup>,
and for not disclosing the identity of the scholars that declared the rules
on which he relied<sup><small><a name=fr67 href=#fn67>67</a></small></sup>.
