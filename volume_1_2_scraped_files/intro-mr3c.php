Messianic Judaism is similar to other Judaisms in seeking to apply the laws
of <i>Torah</i> that God gave to the Israelites at Mt. Sinai. Since those
early days, many changes have occurred that impact our ability to keep the
Law as our ancestors did. They include (1) a change in the Covenant, (2)
Yeshua's birth, ministry on earth, death, and resurrection, (3) universal
accessibility to the Holy Spirit, (4) expansion of the Scriptures to include
the New Testament, (5) lack of a functioning Levitical Priesthood, (6)
absence of the Temple of God and, most important of all, (7) salvation
through faith in Yeshua. These are the New Covenant realities under which we
now live. Consequently the way we keep the Law today cannot be solely
according to the letter; rather, it must be guided by the Holy Spirit for
both wisdom and application.

But as we seek the Holy Spirit for how to keep the Law, we are hindered by
ever-present "elephants in the room". The "elephants" of which I speak are
the well-known writings of the Apostle Paul which seem to say that obeying
the Mosaic Law is no longer profitable and may even cause spiritual harm. I
knew it was not so, but because I have had to restudy and rethink Paul's
statements every time someone raised them to me in debate, I decided to write
this short commentary in order to explain what I believe Paul really meant
in his writings.

Each numbered caption that follows is a statement one often hears from
opponents of observing Biblical Law. Then following each caption are
Scriptures (translated in the New King James), authored by Paul, that are
often used to support erroneous views of the Law, and after that comes my
commentary. The New King James translation is used (with "Messiah" replacing
"Christ" and "Yeshua" replacing "Jesus") because it and the NIV are among
the most popular, and the most egregious in misrepresenting Paul.

<u>Romans 6:14</u>:
"</i>For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law
but under grace</i>."
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This sounds like Paul is saying that God's "grace" releases us to do
anything we want, and from having to obey any of God's laws. Why would the
Apostle Paul, a confessed keeper of the Law (<u>Acts 21:17-26</u>), say
such a thing? Did Yeshua's appearance on earth and subsequent sacrifice
cause God to change into a permissive liberal? I knew that couldn't be the
case, but still, what Paul said perplexed me, so I decided to pray and ask
God about it.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
What I believe I heard prophetically in reply is this: Being "under grace"
is not automatically permissive as some would like it to be. Grace does
sometimes imply permissive allowance or forgiveness, but being under God's
grace does not mean that He always grants it to us. Rather, it means that
we are subject to the <u>operation</u> of God's grace, and that He (and
only He) decides when to extend it and when to withhold it.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Theologians often define "grace" (<i>kharis</i>) as "God's unmerited favor"
(which is correct) but, in his writings, Paul uses it metaphorically to
mean God Himself, whose very person embodies grace. <u>Romans 6:14</u> is
therefore informing us that our accountability is no longer merely to the
"statutes" of God's written Word (His <i>Torah</i> or Law), but is now
directly to God Himself through the living Word, who is Yeshua (<u>John
1:14</u>). Our being "under grace" is Paul's way of saying that, in this
direct accountability to God, God may either extend His grace to us or
withhold it, on a case by case basis, according to His supreme sense of
mercy and justice. Our being "not under law", (the Greek word here for
"under" is <i>hupo</i>, meaning "underneath") connotes that we are no
longer "underneath" the Law's enforcement; that is, we no longer
automatically receive the Law's penalties for disobedience, but there is no
doubt that we continue to be (and are now directly) subject to God's
correction and punishment (as well as His praise and reward) when we are
deserving of them. Meanwhile, the commandments of <i>Torah</i>, as
interpreted by the Holy Spirit, retain their relevance in being a main
source for our determining God's Will, but our "obedience" relationship
with God is now direct rather than indirect. That is why Paul says in
<u>Galatians 5:18</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"<i>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law</i>".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
And similarly in <u>Galatians 3:24-25</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"<i>Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Messiah, that we might
be justified by faith. But after faith </i>[meaning "Messiah"]<i> has
come, we are no longer under a tutor</i>".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
What I have said about "grace" thus far has been in response to Paul's
juxtaposing "grace" and "law". I would, however, be remiss were I not to
mention another kind of grace that God <u>never</u> withholds. It is God's
empowerment, through the Holy Spirit, to do as well and as much as God, in
His sovereignty, is willing to release us to. So it would seem, for
example, that God always extends grace to a person who seeks His power for
obedience, and to do good. We depend on God's grace to perform His will.

In <u>Romans 3:20 &amp; 28</u>, Paul says:

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His
sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin ... Therefore we conclude
that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
And in <u>Galatians 2:15-16 &amp; 21</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that

in vain.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
These Scriptures and others like them are often quoted to deny the Law's
continuing value in the New Covenant. After all (some think), if
righteousness cannot be acquired from performing the deeds of the Law, then
why do them? The answer is that, with the power and discernment that the
Holy Spirit allows us, we perform the deeds of the Law because they are
God's will - not in order to become righteous and acquire salvation.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Paul is very clear that no one is justified (i.e. made righteous - saved)
through merely obeying commandments. Justification comes only through our
reliance on Yeshua's sacrifice that expunges our sins if we receive Him
and repent; that's why <u>Galatians 2:16</u> states:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"<i>... a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in
Yeshua the Messiah</i>".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Romans 3:28</u> says the same thing but differently; it says:

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
None of this contradicts Paul's contention that God's Law continues to have
value in the New Covenant. We can be certain of this because in <u>Romans

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The expressions "dead to the law", "died to the law", and "delivered from
the law" have led many to believe that God's Law no longer applies to us.
That is not at all what Paul is saying.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In <u>Romans 7:4-6</u>, Paul is comparing our relationship with God to the
intimate relationship of marriage. Prior to the New Covenant, our
"marriage" relationship with God was mostly through our obedience to the
statutes of <i>Torah</i> because we did not yet have Yeshua's sacrifice or
the Holy Spirit to draw us closer. It was a wonderful relationship, but
God made it even better by sending Yeshua who sacrificed Himself for us.
This brought us into a "marriage" relationship with Yeshua that was more
intimate than our marriage relationship through the Law. But because it is
not God's will that we be in two marriages at the same time, Paul explains
that we died during our marriage to the Law in order to clear the way for
our "marriage" to Yeshua. That is what Paul meant when he said:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"<i>you also have become dead to the law through the body of Messiah, that
you may be married to another</i>" (<u>Romans 7:4</u>) and his other
saying: "<i>I through the law died to the law that I might live to God</i>"
(<u>Galatians 2:19</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Paul's reference to being "delivered from the Law" and being "held" by the
law is a continuation of his metaphor that we have moved from one marriage
relationship to another. It is not as some believe - Paul stating that
God's Law held us in bondage. I said "God's Law" instead of just "Law"
purposely, in order to illustrate how much easier it is to accept that some
nondescript "Law" held us in bondage, than to think that "God's Law" held
us in bondage, which we know cannot be true. Also, Paul's reference to the
"newness of the Spirit" and the "oldness of the letter" is completely
consistent with the Scriptures and everything else Paul said because, in
the New Covenant, our principal way of relating to God has changed. Paul
recognizes our changed relationship to the Law, but at no time infers that
the <i>Torah</i> has been done away with or has been rendered useless.

Once again, the words that Paul uses are often misconstrued - in this case,
the word "curse", which some would have us believe means that God's Law is
a curse. No, the curse to which Paul is referring originates in
<u>Deuteronomy 30:19</u>, which reads:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
When these words were given by God to Moses under the previous covenant,
the context was 'covering over sin' through obedience to the Law and animal
sacrifice. Israel's choice to either obey the Law and live, or disobey and
not live, was a reference to salvation that, unbeknown to the Israelites at
Mt. Sinai, would be granted in the future as a result of Yeshua's
sacrifice. Paul's words paralleling <u>Deuteronomy</u> were spoken many
centuries after Sinai under the New Covenant, when our path to salvation
had been transferred from conducting animal sacrifices to having faith in
Yeshua, the ultimate sacrifice. Paul was warning the Galatians not to
seek covering over of their sins in the old way of obedience to the Law
with attendant animal sacrifices, but rather to seek salvation in the new
way which was through Yeshua. Not only was the old way no longer
authorized but, under it, even a single violation would result in the
cursing referred to in <u>Deuteronomy 30:19</u> that led to death. But
Paul is clear in <u>Galatians 3:11 (NKJ)</u> that in the New Covenant:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>no one is justified by the law</i>,

and he quotes <u>Habakkuk 2:4</u> (see also, <u>Romans 1:7</u> and

from trying to keep it as a means of acquiring salvation.

This Scripture is sometimes used to assert that God's food laws, appointed

effect, and that those who adhere to them are putting themselves back under
the "Law of sin and death", and even denying Yeshua. Now that's a pretty
ominous charge for merely resting on the Sabbath and abstaining from pork.

Paul was not, therefore, advocating disregard for the <i>Torah</i>. Rather,
he was warning us against being in bondage to "fences" that some would
place around the <i>Torah</i> - rules promulgated by men that are beyond
and more stringent than those commanded by God.

These verses of Scripture are sometimes used, in conjunction with others,
to assert the Mosaic Law's inadequacy, defectiveness, and obsolescence.
But if those making the assertion would look at the Scriptures carefully,
they would see that what is being spoken of is the Mosaic Covenant - not
the Mosaic Law. A covenant is a relationship - an agreement between
parties. The Mosaic Covenant was the relationship that was consummated at
Mt. Sinai between God and the Israelites, where God gave the Israelites His
Laws (the <i>Torah</i>), and the Israelites promised to obey. Well, they
didn't obey, and they consequently breached the Covenant; the word "breach"
and "fault" are the same. The Covenant between God and the Israelites
developed a fault that was not intrinsic to the covenant agreement, but
rather one that was created by the Israelites' disobedience. We see this
clearly in <u>Hebrews 8:8</u> that says:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Because finding fault with THEM, He says: "Behold, the days are coming,
says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and
with the house of Judah ...</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Notice how the Scripture says "<i>finding fault with THEM</i>". The fault
was with the Israelites - not in the design of the covenant. Then we read
in both <u>Hebrews 8:8</u> and <u>Jeremiah 31:30-31(31-32)</u> that, rather
than God leaving Israel without a covenant (which He could have done and
which they deserved), He graciously gave them a New and different covenant
that was based on better promises. In the process of doing that, He
allowed the First Covenant to gradually pass into oblivion; that is what
Paul means by the First Covenant becoming obsolete.

So, do we need to obey the Mosaic Law? Well, yes and no! Part of the
Mosaic Law can no longer be complied with because it has lost its
covenantal infrastructure. We have no operative Levitical Priesthood, no
Jerusalem Temple in which to conduct animal sacrifices, and no unified
leadership of Israel. Yeshua should be recognized by everyone as the King
of Israel, and His sacrifice as the reason why many commandments connected
to the Temple can no longer be performed. Still, there are many
commandments that remain doable, but they have now come under New Covenant
administration and are subject to New Covenant enforcement. When added to
other mandates of the New Covenant, they collectively become what
<u>Galatians 6:2</u> calls "the Law of Messiah".

<u>2 Corinthians 3:5-8</u>:
<i>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being
from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God, who also made us
sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the
Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. But if the
ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious, so that
the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because
of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away, how will the
ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?</i>

The <u>2 Corinthians</u> Scripture refers to the written Law as a "Ministry
of Death", and says that "the letter (presumably of the Law) kills". It
certainly appears to support the view of those who would preach doing away
with the Law, yet the Scripture also says that the written Law was glorious
- an apparent contradiction. What then is Paul trying to say? Paul is
reflecting about the Old Covenant, when the Holy Spirit was not accessible
to the average Israelite, and when literal obedience to the Law was indeed
the prescribed path to life. But it ceased to be the path to life in the
New Covenant when Yeshua's sacrifice gave us direct access to God, and the
Holy Spirit was given to us to be the Law's interpreter. So Paul is
warning us that today our approach to God's Law must be through the Holy
Spirit and not through mere literal observance. He is warning us that
although literal obedience to the Law led us to life under the Old
Covenant, by-passing the Holy Spirit to pursue literal obedience will lead
us to death under the New. That is not to say that today the letter of the
Law has no application. It does, but it must be the Holy Spirit who gives
us the application.

These Scriptures have occasionally been used to teach that, when Messiah

us to love our neighbor, which is the Law's fulfillment.

<u>Romans 10:4</u> is easy to explain. Put simply, the word "end" in the
verse does not mean "termination of existence", it means "purposeful
destination" as in the expression "the end justifies the means". It tells
us that Messiah is to whom the Law brings us. As for <u>Galatians 5:14</u>,
both the Law of Moses and the Gospel of Yeshua stand for selfless sacrifice
as against self-interest. When we "<i>love 'our' neighbor as
'ourself'</i>", we fulfill the ultimate of what the Law stands for, but we
are not released from obeying God's specific and detailed Commandments. If
we were, He would have told us.

<font size=4><b>Conclusion</b></font><br>
I hope this commentary helps to clear the "elephants" from the room. We can
criticize Paul's choice of words or the translations of his writings, but
what we cannot do is believe that Paul would condone the myriad of anti-law
statements that have been attributed to him.
