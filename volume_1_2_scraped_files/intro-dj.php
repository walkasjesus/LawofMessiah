New Covenant <i>Torah</i>: What is the meaning of this phrase? New Covenant
<i>Torah</i> is a concept that recognizes the continuing place of
<i>Torah</i> (Law-instruction) of God as given in the Mosaic writings and
expanded in the Prophets and the writings of the New Covenant Scriptures. It
is a concept that also recognizes that we are in the New Covenant Era of
fulfillment. Though not under the Mosaic Covenant <i>per se</i>, we are
still to be instructed by the Mosaic writings and apply them, as fitting, to
the New Covenant order. This meaning will become clearer as I continue.

As Thomas McComiskey argued in his excellent book "<u>Covenants of
Promise</u>", the Abrahamic Covenant is permanent. The Mosaic Covenant is a
temporary administration of the Abrahamic Covenant, and the New Covenant is
its permanent administration. However, the New Covenant teaches (explicitly
in some passages and implicitly throughout) that the Mosaic teaching is of
continuing validity; it is Scripture, and is "<i>profitable for teaching, for
reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of
God may be complete, equipped for every good work</i>" (<u>2 Timothy
3:16-17</u> RSV). This leads us to the unavoidable question of how it trains
us; what does its teaching require us to do if anything? This is the
question of <i>halakhah</i>, the Jewish concept of the way, or the
application of the <i>Torah</i> to new situations.

It has been common to teach that Judaism is a religion of law and
Christianity a religion of grace. This is a distortion of both Judaism
(especially Biblical Judaism) and of Christianity. Judaism knows grace and
mercy; its prayers constantly appeal to God for forgiveness, not on the basis
of our merit, but solely on the basis of God's mercy and grace. Classical
Christianity also knows the place of the <i>Torah</i> (Law-instruction) and
has sought to apply the Law of God according to its understanding of what is
fitting to the New Covenant order. This has been so, even where it is not
clearly acknowledged that this is what is happening. For example,
Christianity has universally endorsed the teaching of Moses from Leviticus
concerning forbidden marriages which define incest. These standards are not
repeated in the New Testament. Christianity has an ethical tradition of
applying the Law which we could call its <i>halakhah</i>. The weakness of
Christianity in the west today is partly due to the loss of this ethical
tradition, and the gross abandonment of duty to train in it.

The word <i>halakhah</i> comes from the word <i>halak</i>, which means "way".
The first followers of Yeshua were called "followers of the way", i.e.
<i>halakhah</i> from Yeshua! <i>Halakhah</i> derives from two motives. One
is to apply the <i>Torah</i> (Law-instruction) of God to new situations where
the application is not obvious. The second is to protect the <i>Torah</i> by
adding regulations so that one will not get close to breaking the law. The
second motive is found in the ancient rabbinic text <i>Pirke Avot</i>, the
"Ethics of the Fathers". This is called "building a fence around the
<i>Torah</i>". At times, this endeavor led to an expanding legalism that was
far removed and even opposed to the original instruction of the <i>Torah</i>.
Sometimes it also gave grounds for violating the intent of the commandment
through ingenious ways of getting around it. We can see the controversy of
Yeshua and the Pharisees in this light. Pharisaic Judaism evolved into
Rabbinical Judaism with all of its pros and cons; perhaps much evolved in
opposition to Messianic Judaism and an attempt to gain total government over
the Jewish people (see Daniel Gruber's "<u>Rabbi Akiba's Messiah</u>"). Yet
the basic need for <i>halakhah</i> is unavoidable. Just as the United States
Constitution has to be applied to new situations by the courts of our land,
so the Mosaic Constitution needs to be applied to new situations as well
(e.g.: What do we do with all of the laws related to the Temple, now that
there is no Temple?).

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Halakhah</i> (binding law upon the Jewish community) that was not
explicitly written in the <i>Torah</i>, was built through consensus that
arose out of intense debate in the early rabbinic <i>yeshivot</i> or
academies. If the academy was important enough and other academies were
swayed to its viewpoint, it became the universal practice among the Jewish
people. The decision for each academy was either made by the ruling rabbi
who was especially revered (and hence the others would concur), or it was
made by the majority opinion of all the rabbis of a particular school. The
<i>halakhah</i> was orally preserved and passed down (in the <i>Mishnah</i>
first of all) and in the application of the <i>Mishnah</i> called the
<i>Gemara</i>. The <i>Mishnah</i> contains the earlier of these decisions
and the tradition of law passed on from these. The <i>Mishnah</i> and the
<i>Gemara</i> together make up the <i>Talmud</i>. The rules of logic for
reaching decisions are sometimes in accord with the normal rules of logic
studied today. However, other rules are recipes for subjective conclusions
and provide ways to ingeniously defend any position desired by the proponent.
Rabbi Ishmael's early 13 rules of logic are simpler and more objective than
Akiba's expansive list of rules of interpretation. The amazing thing is the
claim that the Oral Law (which was later written down contrary to the Oral
Law itself) is from Moses, was handed down from generation to generation, and
has equal authority to the written <i>Torah</i>. Lawrence H. Shiffman of New
York University, an eminent authority on Rabbinic Judaism, argues in his book
"<u>From Text to
Tradition</u>"<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>,
that the Oral <i>Torah</i>, in traditional Judaism, in fact supersedes and
really replaces the written <i>Torah</i>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The claim that the Oral Law is from Moses is really quite indefensible and is
certainly an attempt by the rabbinic community in the early centuries after
the first century to establish the authority of their traditions and their
conclusions. Indeed, two aspects of this claim are within the <i>Talmud</i>.
One is that the earlier tradition of the elders, perhaps a very small body of
material introduced by the phrase "we have a tradition" is seen as accurately
passed down. Indeed, the rest is sometimes seen as lost and rediscovered by
the application of rabbinic logic to the questions at hand; this is not
reasonably believable. That is not to say that rabbinic reflection is not
important in our own work in applying the <i>Torah</i>. The rabbis'
conclusions are sometimes very insightful and helpful to our own application
today. God's common grace is at work here.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The rabbis were correct concerning the need for applying the <i>Torah</i> to
new situations and having sufficient authority vested in some body to unify
the Jewish community in its basic practice. The process is akin to
legislation and constitutional law in the United States and other
constitutional nations. However, the Protestant Reformation position teaches
us that every generation must re-think and re-apply what is handed down in
every generation. Traditional application must be tested by the bar of the
Written Word and adjusted to be true to it. Reformed Churches were fond of
saying that they were reformed and always reforming, seeking to be truer to
the written word for all new situations. Hence, it is wrong to create a
fixed tradition of authoritative <i>halakhah</i> which so overlays the
Written Word that we can never get back to the Written Word to test the Oral
<i>Torah</i>. As Lawrence Shiffman shows, the appeal to the Written Word to
defend the Oral <i>Halakhah</i> is often strained and far-fetched, but done
to give some reverence to the Written Word.

Messianic Jews seek to apply the <i>Torah</i> (Law-instruction) of God to the
New Covenant situation and to the particular situation of life in which we
find ourselves. We use the words "Law-instruction" as a hyphenated
expression because the concept of <i>Torah</i> is more than law; it is God's
whole instruction or teaching. However, it is a mistake to not recognize
that a large part of this instruction consists of laws and commandments.
Some in response to Christian criticism of the idea of a cold impersonal law
have sought to strip <i>Torah</i> of its association with law. However, I
want to argue that the idea of law should be a happy and attractive concept.
Suffice it to say that all must grapple with the meaning as it applies to the
whole Bible and its application to our present lives. This includes the
Mosaic writings.

The New Testament, which Messianic Jews often prefer to call the New Covenant
Scriptures, is <i>Torah</i>-positive. Unfortunately, there has been a gross
misunderstanding of the place of the Law of God in recent Christianity which
was not true in most of classical Christianity. This misunderstanding
derives from a theology called "dispensationalism" (in its classical form).
The problem is, in my opinion grave, but solely from the promise of God,
I do believe the Church will get it right before the return of the Lord
(<u>John 17:21</u>). Present theological trends, however, are not too
encouraging, though there are some glimmers of hope. Despite some
significant differences between classical Christianity and dispensationalism
(which we will outline later), classical Christianity came to a reasonably
correct conclusion concerning the place of the Law and the application of
Moses to the New Covenant order. This consensus basically yields a specific
theology of the relationship of spirit and law, gospel and law, and law and
grace. Perhaps John Calvin's summary in Book II Chapter 7 of his
"<u>Institutes of the Christian Religion</u>" is representative.

Generally, this consensus taught that the Church was the new Israel and had
replaced the old ethnic Israel (There were significant dissenters from this
viewpoint, especially among the Puritans, English Anglicans, and Baptists).
The Protestant Church divided the Law into two parts - the Moral Law and the
Ceremonial Law. The Moral Law continued in the New Covenant order, but the
Ceremonial Law was merely for the purpose of pointing forward to the Messiah,
and was therefore temporary. When fulfillment came, the Ceremonial Law was
made obsolete, and to continue to engage in the Ceremonial Law was understood
to be acting as though the Messiah (the law's fulfillment) had not come;
hence, practice of the Ceremonial Law was forbidden by the Catholic and
Orthodox churches.

Basically, it is understood that we are under condemnation due to our
violation of the universal dimensions of the Law of God as taught in
Scripture. However, Yeshua died to pay the penalty due us according to the
Law, and the record of our transgressions was cancelled. Not only so, but
when we repent and believe, submitting to Yeshua as Lord, we are transformed
within. The old man is crucified, and the body of sin is rendered powerless
(<u>Romans 6:6</u>). It is not only that He dies in our place, but we die in
Him and are raised to new life. This transformation of the inner man takes
place by identification with Messiah crucified and risen. Yeshua does not
die for us as separate from us, but He is part of the human race and our
corporate representative. In corporate reality, we are in Him, and He in us
by faith, just as we were in Adam. Furthermore, we can be filled with the
Spirit by faith in Him. Thereby do we enter the Kingdom of God. The Gospel
is the Gospel of the Kingdom, the invitation to come under the rule of the
King by submitting to His transforming grace rooted in His sacrificial death.
Having undergone this transformation, we are now capable of submitting to the
Law-instruction of God. Hence the biblical statements that by faith we
establish the Law (<u>Romans 3:31</u>) and the righteous requirement of the
Law is fulfilled in us who walk by the Spirit and not by the flesh (<u>Romans
8:3-4</u>). The Law is summarized in the commandments to love God with all
our hearts and to love our neighbors as ourselves (<u>Deuteronomy 6:4ff</u>;
<u>Leviticus 19:18</u>; <u>Mark 12:28-31</u>). Therefore "biblical ethics"
is part of the training of ministers and catechumens in Classical
Christianity.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Many understood that the Gospel of the Kingdom required that we come under
the rule of God. We seek to live out God's righteous order in every realm of
life. The righteous order is discerned by the teaching of the whole Bible.
It includes the order of God in marriage, in family, in business and
government, and in science and art! It, of course, includes His order for
the Church. Except for a post millennial minority which saw the Christians
taking over the whole world progressively and completely before the return of
Yeshua, Classical Christianity taught that we are to live out the Kingdom in
every sphere of life. Though we will not come into the fullness of the
Kingdom until the return of the Messiah, we are called to do all we can,
through the power of His Spirit, to establish the Law of God in every sphere
of human life and to thereby show as much of the Kingdom as possible. This
was seen as part of the believer's witness and as part of manifesting the
Glory of God in human life.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Many saw that the Ten Commandments were, for example, really two-fold. Some
of them summarized the requirement to love God exclusively, e.g., all of the
commandments against idolatry. All of the other commandments are expressions
of love for our fellow human beings created in His image. We love God in
rightly loving others. This was seen in the summary of both Yeshua and in
the Judaism of the first century (<u>Mark 12:28-31</u>; <u>Luke
10:25-28</u>). The love of our fellows is expressed in seeking justice and
in establishing God's righteous order. To pursue justice is therefore
equivalent to loving our neighbors, for human beings only find fulfillment in
God's order (<u>Micah 6:6-8</u>). Without the Law, love deteriorates into
mere humanistic sentiment. However, love motivates us to seek to establish
the order of God's righteousness, to maximize the fulfillment of human
beings, and more importantly, to show the wisdom and Glory of God in human
communities that live according to His ways. Justice is rectifying that
which is out of order by applying the blood of Yeshua for forgiveness and
establishing community on the basis of God's principles.

The degree of lack of understanding God's call for justice (His righteous
order as defined in Scripture - not some false humanistic idea of equality)
is appalling. God's justice is hardly a topic in the contemporary Church,
whereas it ought to be seen as number one. The Gospel is commonly understood
as cheap grace (Bonhoeffer) that requires nothing of us. Rather, Scripture
puts forth two primary motives for man. The first is to love, glorify and
serve God. This is to capture our hearts totally. The second is to pursue
justice. We preach the Gospel because unless people are transformed and
receive eternal life, they cannot pursue justice motivated by love for
others. The Gospel is God's means of establishing justice. Micah summarized
it well in his great verse that answers the question, <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"<i>...
what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness,
and to walk humbly with your God?</i>"</font> (<u>Micah 6:8</u>, RSV) God has not
changed. All of the instruction of God is to be understood as the details of
how to live out love for God and our fellows. In the Bible, love and justice
are not opposed, but could be seen as a hyphenated word, "love-justice".
When the law is broken, justice is satisfied by blood sacrifice or by paying
the penalty. Love requires restitution to the one wronged; if the offender
is truly repentant, this is his desire. God's love-justice provides the
sacrifice of Yeshua so He can be both just and the justifier of those who are
in Yeshua. I should note that justice in the Bible is only equality before
the law and its requirement. It does not imply economic equality as today's
Marxist influenced social justice warriors. It is rather an order of
righteousness where each person can fulfill their God intended good destiny.
But there can be great disparities of wealth as long as there is good
provision for all. Those with much are to expand opportunity and provision
for all.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In addition, love is the passionate identification with others that seeks
their good guided by law. As such love seeks the destiny fulfillment of the
other. We share much in destiny; to know and love God, to marry and have
children, to have adequate provision. But there is a distinct calling for
every person.

I believe that the Messianic Jewish perspective is in basic accord with this
classical Christian understanding of the relationship of Law and Grace. It
is by grace that we are saved, but the saved individual is a Kingdom person
who glorifies God in obedience to the Law of God. The point at issue with
Messianic Jews is rather the easy distinction between the moral and
Ceremonial Law, which eliminates the place of ethnic Israel in the plan of
God, and eliminates the distinct practices of the Jewish people which define
their "irrevocable" call (<u>Romans 11:29</u>). Having looked at the general
consensus of Classical Protestantism, we now need to look more closely at the
New Testament.

The Gospel material implies a context for understanding the coming of the New
Covenant order. It is the order of the in-breaking Kingdom which is at hand
here. He that is least in the Kingdom of God has a better place than John
the Immerser (<u>Mark 1:14-15</u>; <u>Matthew 11:12</u>). The order of the
New Covenant Kingdom is seen in the acts and teaching of Yeshua and the
disciples. He heals the sick, casts out demons, and raises the dead. These
are manifestations of the Age to Come. Yet it is still a transitional time,
for the Kingdom will not come in fullness until His return. This is the
growing stage of the Kingdom where the Word of the Good News is preached as a
farmer scatters seed, and the Kingdom grows from a small beginning until it
is a large tree as in the parable of the mustard seed (<u>Matthew 13</u>).
Though partial, though "already but not yet" (George Ladd in <u>The Gospel of
the Kingdom</u>), the Kingdom (God's New Covenant order) has come and
manifests itself in many spheres when the people of the New Covenant are
submitted to the rule of God. We pray and work to extend this Kingdom and
disciple those from the nations to live by its precepts.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In this context, Yeshua teaches that the written <i>Torah</i> has not been
abolished. Heaven and earth will pass away before "one jot or one tittle"
passes from the <i>Torah</i> (<u>Matthew 5:18</u>, NKJ). Yeshua has come to
fulfill the <i>Torah</i>. What does this mean? It is clear from His
teaching in <u>Matthew 5-7</u>, but is also reflected in all of the Gospel
material. Where the Law of Moses implied a right heart given to obedience to
the Law of God, Yeshua made the right heart orientation the key to His whole
exposition. From the heart comes evil. Not only must one not commit
adultery, but one must not sin by entertaining adultery in one's thought
life. Not only are we to not murder, but me must not entertain thoughts of
hatred and vengeance. The New Covenant elevates our ability with greater
grace, and therefore requires an application of Mosaic teaching that is more
exacting. While disagreeing with the Pharisees in some of their
applications, Yeshua removes certain accommodations of Moses that were due to
the "hardness of their hearts" and the weakness of the people (e.g. divorce).
The teaching of Yeshua (and the Apostles) constitutes New Covenant
<i>Halakhah</i>. Yeshua shows the meaning of the Sabbath, the legitimacy of
healing on the Sabbath, eating grain as one walks through the fields, and the
non-binding nature of the tradition of the elders (e.g. hand washing, <u>Mark
7</u>; <u>Matthew 15</u>). Yeshua makes authoritative <i>halakhah</i>, not
by appealing to past tradition (as did the scribes), but by pronouncement
according to his own authority (<u>Matthew 7:28</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This role of making authoritative <i>halakhah</i> is given to the disciples
who will supersede the Jewish Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin. In <u>Matthew
16</u>, Yeshua gives to Peter and the Apostles the keys to the Kingdom of
Heaven, which is the authority to bind and loose. This authority is the
right to forbid behavior (bind) and permit behavior (loose), and was
exercised at the Jerusalem Council concerning the requirements for Gentiles
to join the New Covenant Communities of faith. In addition, <u>Matthew 16
and 18</u> provide the foundation for enjoining congregational discipling for
the New Covenant community, a community of righteous order.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In those passages where Yeshua is accused of violating the <i>Torah</i>,
closer observation shows that He was only violating Pharisaic traditions -
not any commandment of <i>Torah</i>. Where the teaching of Moses set a
standard, sometimes Yeshua would require more. Instead of being truthful in
oath taking, we are to fulfill every word we speak. Instead of allowing
unlimited revenge, the <i>Torah</i> prescribed "an eye for an eye" as the
court standard; this is not, however, a standard for personal ethics and
retaliation. Yeshua corrects this misapplication, and calls for loving our
enemies. All of this is New Covenant <i>Torah</i> instruction. Yeshua did
not violate the Sabbath, but only Pharisaic interpretation. As Lord of the
Sabbath, He established <i>halakhah</i> under the principle that the Sabbath
was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We can see, in all of this, that Yeshua taught, enhanced, and applied the
<i>Torah</i>. While the New Testament and the <i>Shlichim</i> (Apostles)
are given binding <i>halakhic</i> authority, there is no warrant that the
authority of later leaders in the New Covenant Community can make
<i>halakhah</i> of this absolute binding nature. There is, however,
authority to interpret and apply, and to govern as is necessary. That
notwithstanding, everything can be questioned by the Written Word, and is to
be reformed by it. Post New Testament, we seek consensus in practical
applications, and the humility to follow this consensus; this never has the
status of the <i>Torah</i>, or the <i>halakhic</i> authority of the New
Testament.

The letters of <i>Sha'ul</i> (Paul) are the primary source of controversy
concerning the place of the <i>Torah</i> in the New Covenant. Some have
interpreted him as teaching the very thing his accusers claimed, that the
Jewish People are to forsake circumcision and Moses. This was denied by Paul
in his testimony in <u>Acts 21</u> where he brought an offering to profess
that he lived according to the <i>Torah</i> [which <i>Ya'akov</i> (James)
called orderly]. Paul's continued profession before Felix, Agrippa, and the
community of Jews in Rome, was unwavering loyalty to the <i>Torah</i>
(<u>Acts 28:17</u>). Indeed, the Book of Acts was written in part to show
the nature of Jewish and Gentile life together in one Body, where Jewish
distinctions of life and calling are maintained.

Gentiles are not generally required to live according to everything that God
requires of Jews, but they are called to live out the universal dimensions of
the <i>Torah</i>. If individual Gentiles and Gentile families have
covenanted to draw near to Jews in a special way and live within a Jewish
community, they will naturally participate in most of the community's Jewish
expressions of <i>Torah</i> life and practice. As for Gentiles who are not
so called and do not live within a Jewish Community, there is much latitude.
However, they become citizens of the Commonwealth of Israel by virtue of
their faith in Yeshua (<u>Ephesians 2:11-22</u>), so it would be well for
them to seek understanding, and appreciation of Jewish aspects of the
<i>Torah</i> for their connection to the Jewish people. This includes an
understanding and application of the "appointed times" (<u>Leviticus 23</u>).
These times give us a sense of the agricultural pattern of life in Israel,
foreshadow the work of Yeshua, and show the meaning of His work. They also
point to the last days and the Age to Come. As a biblical expression and
recognition of their grafted-in Jewish connection (<u>Romans 11</u>) it is
wise that Gentiles and all kinds of church communities teach on these matters
during the seasons of Jewish celebration, and in cases where it is feasible,
to have celebrations of their own connected to these meanings. That
notwithstanding, Gentiles are not required to keep specific calendar days as
Sabbaths (i.e. no work), whether connected to the Rabbinical Calendar, or to
what some scholars now think was the Temple calendar.

The relationship of grace and law, or spirit and law is apparently
paradoxical. Too quick an oversimplification, and we are bound for error.
The paradox is not really a contradiction, but requires deeper unpacking.
This was seen in a correct way by many writers. Calvin largely got it
right. So did Wesley, Finney, Abraham Kuyper, and other classical
representatives. Today, W. D. Davies in <u>Paul and Rabbinic Judaism</u>,
Mark Nanos, Michael Wyschogrod, Professor Averbeck of Trinity in Illinois, C.
E. B. Cranfield, J. Murray, Rhyne, W. P. Kaiser, and many others have got it
right. What is <i>Sha'ul</i> saying?
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
First, he notes that by the law and standard of God, all human beings stand
condemned. Those who are not of Israel do have a reflection of the Law of
God in their ethical tradition. They know deep down that they are
responsible to a Law-giver above themselves. Though Gentile traditions are
greatly corrupted, they yet have sufficient knowledge of the standard of God
to stand condemned before God. Secondly, the Jewish people who have a clear
written revelation of the Law of God stand condemned by its standards. What
is the solution? We cannot save ourselves. Our righteousness is as filthy
rags before the perfection of God's standard. Otherwise, why all of the
blood sacrifices which show the mercy and forgiveness of God, based on
substitution? The answer to this is a free gift which is received by faith,
a trusting response to God's provision and a wholehearted turning to Him in
submission. It is through identification with the crucified and risen
Messiah that we are transformed. We accept that the penalty has been paid by
our representative and that we are by faith said to have been crucified with
Him (<u>Galatians 3:20</u>; <u>Romans 6</u>). Therefore, we are accepted in
Him as righteous.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Before we see this, the Law (this would be true of the Gentile knowledge of
the Law of God as well) is our schoolmaster. It teaches us right from wrong
and shows us that we need a savior. Therefore, we receive righteousness as
a gift apart from the Law, and are justified by faith. However, this does
not mean that the Law (God's Law) has been done away with, but it now
reappears as a tool of discipleship by the power of the Spirit. Thus Paul
can say, <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"<i>... there is one God who will justify the
circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we then make
void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the
law</i>"</font> (<u>Romams 3:30-31</u>, NKJ). The Gospel is God's means of
establishing His <i>Torah</i> which is the goal of salvation history.
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"<i>The</i> &#039;Torah&#039; <i>will go out from Zion, the
word of the LORD from Jerusalem</i>"</font> (<u>Isaiah 2:3</u>, NIV). Grace in
the Pauline writings is not simply unmerited favor as taught by many, but
includes the idea of empowerment by the Spirit to do righteousness. Sin is
still defined as the transgression of the Law and righteousness is still
defined by the Law. So Paul can say that the Hebrew Scriptures train us in
righteousness (<u>2 Timothy 3:16-17</u>; <u>1 John 3:4</u>). However, the
focus of the truly righteous man is not prideful self-striving, but rather
relational loving passion for the Father, the Messiah, and their glory. In
this orientation, we are empowered by Grace via the Spirit, and we fulfill
the righteousness of the Law ( <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"<i>... that the righteous
requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to
the flesh but according to the Spirit</i>"</font> (<u>Romans 8:4</u>, NKJ).)

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
As if this is not enough, Paul rebukes those who say that he teaches
antinomianism (anti-<i>Torah</i>). Such a claim is slanderous (<u>Romans
3:8</u>, <u>6:1-2</u>). In addition, Paul makes it clear that the standards
of the Law are upheld by the Gospel message and states, concerning the
standards of the <i>Torah</i>, that their violation is against the Gospel he
preaches.

Actually, but for the Book of Galatians, error in interpreting Paul would
have been much less. The principles of interpretation should have led us to
interpret Galatians through Romans since it is the fuller and more detailed
presentation of the law-grace issues. The Book of Acts as well provides both
the historical context and interpretation for understanding Galatians. The
issue in Galatians was requiring the circumcision of Gentiles for their
acceptance into the New Covenant community of faith. It was an issue of
understanding that righteousness comes by faith, not by works and the issue
of the broadness of fellowship (which John Yoder and Mark Nanos see as more
central than the issue of justification by faith). However, Galatians is not
against the instruction of the <i>Torah</i>. Indeed, its list of the works
of the flesh can only be understood in the light of the <i>Torah</i>. Those
who walk by the Spirit are not under the Law (subject to striving by our own
efforts and under the condemnation of its penalty which was paid for us).

What defines these sins? What is immorality? Paul says that, apart from the
Law, we would not know what these sins are! Indeed, today we defend as right
open marriage, homosexual marriage, abortion, and much more. How shall we
argue that these things are wrong? Shall we say that the Spirit told me? Or
shall we say that God has revealed His standard in His <i>Torah</i> and in
the extension of that teaching in the whole Bible? Paul's catalogue of
sinful behavior is known to him by the <i>Torah</i>, not by the teaching of
Hollywood! Faith establishes the <i>Torah</i>, but if we by-pass the way of
faith, we do not establish it. The whole Bible looks forward to the age of
the establishing of God's rule, the <i>Torah</i>. The way of faith in the
New Covenant is God's way to it, for He writes the <i>Torah</i> on our
hearts.

If Paul wrote Hebrews, we see nothing but confirmation. The Mosaic Covenant
Order is fading and becoming obsolete. However, in the New Covenant Order,
the <i>Torah</i> is written on our hearts and every individual may
appropriate the power of his co-death with the Messiah, put to death the old
man and be filled with the Spirit. In this the <i>Torah</i> is not done away
with, but is written on our hearts as is applicable to the New Covenant
Order. What passes away are not the standards of God, but the pre-New
Covenant Temple system which looked forward to His coming and an order in
which only a special few could be filled with the Spirit. Now that He has
died, He gives the Holy Spirit to all who are born again. Hebrews is
speaking about the coming of the greater order of the New Covenant. It is
not about abandoning the instruction found within Moses, the Prophet, and the
writings and applying it as is fitting to the New Covenant Order. The issue
is a better covenant where this transforming work is done in us (<u>Hebrews
8:7-13</u>). Ezekiel notes that the New Covenant offers the Spirit who will
move us to obey God's statutes, ordinances, and judgments (<u>Ezekiel 36:24
ff</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Furthermore, Paul teaches that the <i>Torah</i> is still part of Jewish
calling as it is applicable in the New Covenant. This is shown by his
example in completing a Nazirite vow in <u>Acts 18:18</u>, in his profession
in <u>Acts 21 and 28</u>, and in his explicit statements in <u>Romans 9:4
ff</u> where he indicates the gifts given to Israel are still of
significance. In <u>Romans 11:29</u> he states that the gifts and call to
Israel are irrevocable. More will be stated about this continuing call.
However, suffice it to say that the Bible shows us that God is committed to
establishing an order of righteous call to <i>Torah</i>, justice, etc. This
order includes proper relationships between husbands and wives, parents and
children, employers and employees, merchants and shoppers, governments and
peoples, elders and the flock, and Israel and the nations. The last is an
issue of God's right order as well, which He will establish according to His
promise to Abraham.

We will find no evidence against our orientation in the General Epistles. It
is our call to pursue justice, even the establishment of God's righteous
order through the power of the cross and Spirit. John is clear on this and
lets us know that sin is transgression against the Law of God and that the
true disciple does not intentionally sin (or violate the <i>Torah</i> of God)
(<u>1 John 3:4</u>)! He is one who practices righteousness. Peter warns us
that some have misunderstood Paul as an antinomian (against the <i>Torah</i>
and its applicability to the New Covenant). He states that the untaught and
unstable have distorted his writings and twisted them to their own
destruction. That twisting would most probably be connected with allowing
sin because of an anti-law interpretation of Paul. The writings of James
could be well seen as a corrective to those who were misunderstanding Paul.
Therefore he calls for <i>mitzvot</i> (good works) to prove faith and notes
that the <i>Torah</i> is a <i>torah</i> of liberty (<u>James 1:25</u>). His
exposition of the <i>Torah</i> and warning against being found a transgressor
of the <i>Torah</i> are clear (<u>James 2:9</u>). In the history of
interpretation, those who have tended to antinomianism (anti-law) have had a
great struggle with James even to the point of claiming that it was not
Scripture.

Enough has been said, I believe, to convince the fair minded that the
understanding and application of the teaching of the whole Bible on right and
wrong, justice and righteousness, is crucial. It is a key to fighting the
ethical laxity in the Body of believers and is crucial to the legitimacy of
the Messianic Jewish Movement. When teaching the whole Bible, we begin with
Moses and reapply it to the New Covenant Order as did Yeshua and the
<i>Shlichim</i>.

One of the great archaeological discoveries was the treaties of the Hittites,
a large nation at the time of Exodus. The tablets were discovered at the
sites of Nuzi and Mari. They prove the existence of the significant nation
mentioned in the Bible. Before that time, liberal scholars thought that the
Biblical information on this nation was mythological. In the 1950s Professor
George Mendenhall of the University of Michigan noted strong parallels
between these treaties and the form of Covenant material in the Mosaic
writings, especially the Book of Deuteronomy. Meredith Kline expanded this
work and showed that not only were the treaties parallel to covenant material
in the Mosaic writings, but the order and form of the Hittite treaties were
an exact match. His first articles on this were published in the
<u>Westminster Theological Journal</u> in the mid-1960s and later found in
such books as <u>Treaty of the Great King</u> and <u>The Structure of
Biblical Authority</u>. Two great conclusions were asserted by Kline.
First, the Mosaic writings were from Moses, from the time period
traditionally as understood
(15<sup><small>th</small></sup>-13<sup><small>th</small></sup> centuries
B.C.). Indeed, only the Hittite treaty forms from that era exactly parallel
Deuteronomy. Secondly, Kline asserted that the treaty form proves that the
Mosaic material and especially Deuteronomy is fully a covenant of grace.
Covenant - not law - is the basic category for understanding this material.
Law is a subsidiary concept. Other leading scholars picked up on this work
and now assert the same view as Kline. Samuel Schultz, the esteemed Old
Testament professor from Wheaton, in his books <u>The Gospel of Moses</u> and
<u>Deuteronomy: The Gospel of God's Love</u> show his stand by the very
titles. Thomas McComiskey in <u>Covenants of Promise</u> argues similarly
with added insights. Other scholars such as Walter Kaiser, Kenneth Kitchen,
Professor Averbech at Trinity in Illinois, and many more have affirmed these
views as have Messianic Jewish writers, including myself, John Fischer,
Michael Shiffman, and David Stern. I will not repeat in detail what was
written in my book <u>Jewish Roots</u>. Walter Kaiser has his own attempt at
what he might call Christian <i>halakhah</i> in <u>Toward an Old Testament
Ethic</u>. Many of those who argue are Christian scholars with no Messianic
Jewish axe to grind. Because I have given an extensive outline of this
scholarship in <u>Jewish Roots</u>, I will only give a very brief summary.

Deuteronomy is in the form of a covenant of grace whereby God first recounts
to Israel that He saved them through no merits of their own. This is
asserted explicitly and repeatedly in <u>Deuteronomy 8 through 10</u>, where
God says it is not because of her righteousness, largeness, strength, or
attractiveness that she has been saved. Hittite kings liked to assert that
their rule over a subject people was a grace act which the subjects did not
deserve. The historical material is to demonstrate that Israel's history is
characterized by being given mercy, grace, and love that is undeserved. In
gratitude for this love, Israel is called to be a society in obedience to
God's <i>Torah</i> in every realm of life, from absolute loyalty to God
Himself, to business integrity, to integrity and truth in the court system,
to caring for the poor. Obedience is a response to grace and salvation
offered as a gift. Therefore, Israel's corporate salvation fits the same
pattern as the invitation for individual salvation in the New Covenant.
Furthermore, the sacrificial system shows that repentance, forgiveness, and
blood substitution is at the heart of the Covenant, forestalling any proud
view that salvation is gained by our autonomous attainment of good works.
The Sabbath is in the center of the Ten Commandments because it is a covenant
sign between God and Israel. It shows forth the meaning of God's creation
pattern, and is a perfect symbol for a people delivered from the bondage of
slavery, for freedom from work one day in seven is a manifestation of a
people set free. This day is given for God, worship, and fellowship.

Once this is understood, we can see that there is greater continuity between
the Mosaic Covenant and the New Covenant than even perceived by our
<i>Torah</i>-positive Puritan brothers of yesteryear. Even the Ten
Commandments is really a covenant of grace beginning with the declaration of
unearned salvation, 'I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.' The New Testament looks at us all as
in a house of slavery spiritually until we are born again and enter the
Kingdom of God.

As we stated, the application of the teaching of Moses (and of the whole
Bible) to new challenges and situations requires prayer and thinking akin to
what Jewish people call <i>halakhic</i> thinking. Even the New Testament
material requires such thinking. Do women wear head coverings today as
specified in <u>1 Corinthians 11</u>? If so, how much must they cover of the
woman's head? Are the coverings only to be worn in the worship service in
public? If not, why not? However, our concern will primarily be the

Consistency is a virtue, but not all followers of Yeshua or theologians are
consistent. Consistency is based on the virtue of integrity, honesty, and
the trustworthiness of our words; however, sometimes it is better that there
are some inconsistencies rather than people following the full logical
conclusions of their positions. For example, the most anti-<i>Torah</i>
theologians usually follow the <i>Torah</i> when it comes to its list of
forbidden sexual unions that would constitute incest. Christian theologians
that are more consistent have put forth theses for what parts of the
<i>Torah</i> should be followed in the New Covenant era, and what should be
rejected. With regard to their varying theses, Protestant streams have
differed with regard to the question of the extent to which the Mosaic
writings are in continuity with the New Covenant. This
continuity-discontinuity question is one of the most foundational issues in
theology. Generally, Protestant theology in its classical form distinguished
between the ceremonial and moral parts of the Mosaic <i>Torah</i>. The
former is valuable for study that we might more fully understand the work of
Yeshua, but is no longer to be practiced. However, the Moral Law is binding
in the New Covenant. Where the lines are drawn between moral and ceremonial
varies. I will now briefly outline the continuity-discontinuity pattern in
various streams.

Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox thought did not make a clear distinction
between ceremonial and moral law. Instead, the early Church that gave rise
to both the Eastern and Western Churches developed patterns that were
parallel to Tabernacle-Temple ceremonies. In addition, moral theologians did
seek to apply the Mosaic teaching for part of the ethical and social basis
of Christian civilization. Let us take the Roman Catholic Church as an
example. There is, first of all, a class of priests provided by the
population. These priests are analogous to the Levites and <i>Kohanim</i> of
ancient Israel. The Levites continued by tribal descent. Roman Catholic
Priests serve by entering into training, taking vows of celibacy, and by
being ordained by a bishop who is seen in apostolic succession to the
original Apostles. Lineage is important in priesthoods - physical lineage in
the former, and a spiritual lineage of continuity by the laying on of hands
in the latter. The Church parallels the Tabernacle-Temple in offering daily
and special sacrifices upon an altar. However, the sacrifice offered is the
sacrifice of "Christ" in the Mass. Until recently, the priest turned from
the congregation for the elements to be transformed in the liturgy. This was
analogous to the High Priest entering the Most Holy Place on Yom Kippur. In
the Eastern Church, the priest actually goes behind the door and leaves the
presence of the congregation to enter the "Most Holy Place". The people eat
of the sacrifice (the bread); traditionally there was a portion only for the
priest (the wine - blood). This was before today's change whereby the people
are also offered the wine. There are many symbols reminiscent of the Hebrew
Scriptures. There are seven-branched lamps, priestly garments, priestly
hats, and an eternal light and incense. Stained glass windows include heroes
from ancient Israel as well as New Testament figures. The Roman Catholic
Church has created a "New Covenant Temple worship". The Sabbath day is also
special, but has been transferred to Sunday when the resurrection is also
celebrated. Whatever one might think of the totality of the Roman Catholic
orientation, it is clear that there is a large degree of continuity from
ancient times. Yet, continued Jewish life among Jewish believers was seen as
not entering into the reality of the New Covenant priesthood and Temple
realities. Catholic moral theology also developed a Canon Law tradition that
is parallel to Rabbinic thought. New rules are added and ways are developed
to get around the law in various cases (casuistry). It should also be noted
that the Christian calendar is in continuity in some ways, and in
discontinuity in other ways, with the biblical calendar. Passover and Easter
sometimes coincide, but solar dating makes this happen only periodically;
nevertheless, the fact that Easter occurs in the Spring is clearly rooted in
Passover. In the Eastern Church, which defended the Bible's lunar calendar,
the concordance of its feasts with the Jewish calendar is more obvious. Good
Friday before Easter and Passover season is the closest thing on the
Christian calendar to Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Protestant tradition
largely maintained the same calendar as the Catholic tradition, so we can see
that the distinction between moral and Ceremonial Law is not followed through
with.

Martin Luther rejected much of Catholic doctrine. The priesthood of all
believers and the identification of the gathered community of saints (as a
temple) was asserted. However, the bread and wine of the Messiah's Supper
was seen as truly conveying the body and blood of Yeshua spiritually. The
liturgy that sets these elements apart, the role of the clergy, and the
symbolism of the Church itself still show marks of continuity to ancient
Israel. The seven-branch lamp, the eternal light, the priestly robes, and
the designation of the table of the Lord's Supper as the altar still show
continuity with the Ceremonial Law even if Lutheran theology too-easily
adopted the "ceremonial" and "moral" as distinctions. Luther was not
consistent in his approach to the Law. At one point he would assert that we
should love God and do as we please. He railed against those who held that
the Sunday Sabbath should be enforced and wrote that the English that were
enjoining sedate quiet and reflection, should be required to have sports and
recreation on Sunday. On the other hand, Luther's <u>Shorter and Larger
Catechism</u> put forth the Ten Commandments, with explanation and
application such that they should be obeyed. Luther's associate Philip
Melanchthon and the great Lutheran systematician Johannes Andreas Quenstedt,
both moved toward a more consistent position similar to Reform thought.
Luther's thought was, therefore, ambivalent to the Mosaic writings and was
inconsistent in approach. The relationship of the Law-Gospel dialectic was
never resolved; the ambivalence is still present in Lutheran thought today.

Those of the Calvinist tradition projected a very high regard for
<i>Torah</i>. They accepted the distinction of the Ceremonial and Moral Law.
Calvin put forth a clear theology of the Law whereby it brings conviction of
sin and leads us to the Messiah; it restrains sin in society by becoming the
basis of civil law with its penalties, and it is a tool of discipleship for
the believer through the work of the Holy Spirit. This discipling tool
dimension for believers was called the "third use of the Law". Calvin found
this in <u>2 Timothy 3:16-17</u> where all Scripture was said to be valid for
training in righteousness. When the grace of God has been received, the
Spirit enables us to be obedient to the Law of God. The Sabbath (now
switched to Sunday according to their understanding of the New Testament) was
considered to be part of the Moral Law since it was in the Ten Commandments,
while (for example) <i>Yom Kippur</i> was seen as part of the Ceremonial Law.
Circumcision, the biblical calendar, and the Temple service have not passed
away. Dutch Reform Churches and Presbyterians followed in this tradition.

Puritans in the Calvinist tradition maintained the same basic stance whether
they became British Presbyterians or Congregationalist or Calvinist Baptists.
We see the same reflected in the writings of Increase Mather in the American
Colonies, and of Jonathan Edwards one hundred years later. The Colonial
Puritans, especially, wrestled with how to apply the Law of God and, more
than any other group, thought to build a society upon the basis of the Law.
The Moral Law was seen as including personal, civil, and business law.
Puritans exacted civil penalties, including capital punishment, based on the
Mosaic Law. They were a prosperous society, seeing themselves as a New
Israel, parallel to ancient Israel; yet they had special regard for ancient
Israel. Many saw a future purpose for ethnic Israel. Christmas celebration
in Puritan New England was forbidden as too pagan in its roots! On the
continuity-discontinuity issue, Puritans weighed in heavily on the side of
continuity. Applying the Law was not only abstract, but ordered Puritan life
for over a century.

The Anglican Church developed an amazing eclecticism of Catholic, Lutheran,
and Reform thought. Puritans were in and out of the Church of England
preceding, during, and after the period of Oliver Cromwell in the
17<sup><small>th</small></sup> Century. One can see the Ceremonial Law
applied as in the Catholic Church in the ceremony of the High Anglican. The
theology of the Eucharist which is given in both kinds (bread and wine) is
closer to Luther. The understanding of the general relationship of law to
grace is like unto Calvin, and justification by faith is accepted doctrine.
A married priesthood by apostolic succession is parallel to but different
than the Roman Catholic view. When it came to applying the Mosaic Law, the
Anglican orientation was set by Richard Hooker in his <u>Laws of
Ecclesiastical Polity</u>. Hooker argues against the Puritan position of
literally applying the Mosaic Law to order social and civil life (there was
no debate between Puritans and Anglicans). Hooker argues that the Mosaic
Law, as given, was for ancient Israel. We had to discern more universal
principles in the Law and apply them to new circumstances in our society.
Reason could as well discover principles for Church, civil and social life as
well as helping us apply the Scriptures to new situations. The Puritans
responded that the human mind is not given to second-guess the Law of God by
looking for principles in the manner of Hooker. One can see from this debate
that the question of continuity-discontinuity and the application of the Law
is no new issue. My view is that the Anglicans were too quick to dismiss
direct application because it offended their human sentiment. However, many
laws are based on obvious principle and are not required of us literally.
Shall we build a fence on our roof (<u>Deuteronomy 22:8</u>) when it is not
used for living space as in ancient flat-roof houses? The principle of
taking reasonable steps to protect human life from accident is clear.

John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement was an Anglican. He did
not emphasize the application of specific Mosaic commandments, but exhibited
a high regard for law. After his death, the Methodists were forced to leave
the Anglican Church to practice their convictions. A high regard for moral
standards and holiness based on the Law and its exposition in the Sermon on
the Mount was a noteworthy part of Methodism.

In the 16<sup><small>th</small></sup> Century, several leaders believed that
the reformation did not go far enough. These were the Anabaptists, committed
to simple life, pacifism, adult baptism, and material sharing. While having
a high regard for the Law and seeing obedience as the outworking of grace,
they saw the teaching of the New Testament as a sufficient exposition and
application of the Law for Christians. The Sermon on the Mount was the
center of this understanding. Anabaptists saw continuity and discontinuity,
but thought that the New Covenant required a much higher standard than the
Mosaic. The Mosaic writings would be studied for ethical guidance, mostly to
supplement the New Testament. There was high regard for the principle of law
and holiness, but the New Covenant community in its pacifism, communal
sharing, openness to all peoples, and love for the enemy was seen in
discontinuity with the "Old Testament". Mennonites, Amish, Church of the
Brethren, Brethren in Christ and others come from the Anabaptist traditions.
In all of these traditions, we see that the Church has had to wrestle with
the issue of continuity and discontinuity. In doing so, the Church produced
varieties of Christian <i>halakhah</i>. Some saw great continuity and others
more discontinuity.

The end of the 19<sup><small>th</small></sup> Century spawned a movement that
dramatically affected western Evangelical Protestantism. It broke from
Classical Christianity and presented a view of radical discontinuity between
the Mosaic Covenant and the New Covenant. Others had anticipated these
views, but were labeled antinomian heretics. Their movements came to little.
An Irish Anglican priest by the name of John Nelson Darby was troubled by the
"deadness" in the Anglican Church. In reflecting on the problem, Darby
concluded that the basic problem was confusion between law and grace. This
problem was rooted in the 39 Articles, the basic doctrinal statement of the
Anglican Communion. Darby asserted that the "Old Testament" was a
dispensation of law that was in total contrast to the New Testament period,
a dispensation of grace. Though having a place for ethnic Israel
in the future, all who become Christians are no longer "Jew" or "Gentile",
but part of the bride. Continued Jewish life in the New Covenant would
confuse law and grace. In Darby, the Mosaic Covenant offered salvation on
the basis of keeping the Law, and this was bound to lead to failure and
death. However, the sacrifices anticipated the coming of the Messiah so the
"Old Testament" saints were not without a grace element, and by believing in
the substitute sacrifices, they were preserved for the salvation that would
come in Yeshua. Darby radically redefined grace as only unmerited favor.
Darby taught that New Testament offers salvation by grace through faith with
a specific "Darby-ite" slant. It was that believing or faith in the death
and resurrection of Yeshua as one's personal Savior from sin is the only
necessary thing required for salvation. Repentance is not necessary.
Submitting to His holy lordship is not necessary. One may continue to live
in sin without showing life change or gratitude and still be saved. One
should not do so, however, but if salvation is by grace, it is a logical
possibility in his scheme. In Classical Christianity, however, the grace
concept included the content of empowerment and motivation to obedience.
This radical redefinition of grace produced a radical discontinuity between
the Mosaic Covenant and the New Covenant. Even the Sermon on the Mount was
seen as part of the dispensation of law. We are not duty-bound to anything
of this dispensation according to Darby and his followers. Even the Ten
Commandments do not have claim on us. We are only duty-bound to the teaching
of the epistles of the New Testament which do repeat the content of nine of
the Ten Commandments.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In this radical discontinuity, Darby asserted the priesthood of all believers
and eschewed clergy. Lay ministers working in other professions would be the
elder-leaders. Ritual would be at a bare minimum (baptism and the Lord's
Supper). How did Darby see this as revitalizing the Church? In his view,
many would be grateful for the unmerited salvation, and they would dedicate
their entire lives. This is a second (but not required) step. The Church,
however, would then be populated by dedicated volunteers, not by people who
thought it was required of them for salvation. Carnal Christians would
largely be outside. In addition, the Church would enforce spiritual
discipline on the flock. Classical Dispensationalism made clear
distinctions. Israel has to do with the Law, the Church with grace. The
former has an earthly salvation, the latter a heavenly one. Today,
neo-dispensationalism is moderating this radical stance. Some teach that
repentance is needed and submission to His lordship (John McArthur). Others
now see the Sermon on the Mount as instruction for the New Covenant. A few
are even saying (from <u>2 Timothy 3:16-17</u>) that one can discern
principles in the Mosaic writings that have application to the dispensation
of grace.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The orientation of Dispensational theology has become part of the popular
sub-culture of American Evangelism. Many who could not even define the term
"Dispensationalism" reflect a popular culture born out of its theology.
Statements like "We are no longer under the Law," in a slant that is contrary
to Classical Christianity, are rooted in this movement. Those who say a
person was saved in a meeting reflect this sub-culture. Classical
Christians would only say a person made a profession and would not find
confidence in their salvation until the fruit of a changed life was brought
forth. Carnal Christianity has some rooting as well, since one may live in
sin and still hope for eternal security (contrary to both Calvinism and
Arminianism). Looseness and disrespect for the Law of God is a plague that
has affected Baptists, Charismatics, Pentecostals, Independent Churches, and
many smaller denominations and streams. Because America has been the leading
force for world missions, Dispensationalism is also found in many nations,
including (to my great chagrin) Israel. Many Israelis link the concept of
<i>Torah</i> with Rabbinical legalism. They unbiblically react in a negative
way to the idea of <i>Torah</i>. When some Israelis become believers in
Yeshua, they easily buy into the anti-Law dimensions of dispensational
theology from the past influence of Christian missions in the Land of Israel.
This is done without conscious realization. The Bible is read through
glasses without awareness that a Christian sub-culture has placed these
glasses upon them.

Messianic Judaism finds itself in a unique position. We oppose the
replacement theology of Classical Christianity where ethnic Israel has been
fully replaced in the purposes of God by the Church. On the other hand, we
oppose the antinomian heresy of Classical Dispensationalism. Messianic
Judaism does see discontinuity between the Mosaic Covenant and the New
Covenant. However, because Paul says that the gift and call of God to Israel
is irrevocable (<u>Romans 11:29</u>), we are oriented to greater continuity
than most Christian views. My little book <u>The Irrevocable Calling</u>
puts forth the idea of why Jewish followers of Yeshua are to live a Jewish
life and the essence of what Jewish life is. In summary, Jewish life is a
priestly witness and an intercessory activity. Our preservation as a nation,
our return to our land, and our celebrations and unique Jewish practices are
a witness to the reality of God and the truth of His Word. In addition, the
Jewish celebrations of Sabbath and the Feasts are a picture of redemptive
meanings that are fulfilled in Yeshua and yet have further fulfillment at the
return of Yeshua and in the Age to Come. We can discern in Scripture what is
required of the Jewish people and what is required of Gentiles in Yeshua. It
is not the same in all regards. Jewish and Gentile believers form a
complementary priesthood. The Sabbath proclaims the existence of God,
recalls creation, and releases intercession that all people might enter their
Sabbath rest through salvation in Yeshua. Passover recalls our deliverance
from Egypt through the Passover blood of the lamb, the coming of Yeshua as
God's lamb, and releases intercessory power by faith, that all people might
"pass over" from sin and death into their promised land in God, and might sit
down together and celebrate. As Israel will inherit the Land, the meek will
inherit the earth. Jewish life in Yeshua is willed by God; it is the
teaching and example of the Apostles.

In applying the <i>Torah</i>, we recognize a degree of discontinuity between
the Mosaic and New Covenants. Just how does the New Covenant differ from the
Mosaic? How is it a better covenant? It is not a contrast between one being
of law and the other of grace, one where God is harsh and the other where God
is forgiving and kind. These are sub-cultural myths. Nor is it that one is
for Israel and the other is for the Nations. Both are made with Israel, but
the New Covenant explicitly applies the promise of the Abrahamic Covenant to
bless all nations by commanding us to bring the message of the Gospel to all.
The following are the basic differences. We now have the power of
identification with Yeshua's crucifixion to put to death the deeds of the
flesh. In addition, all may now be indwelt and filled with the Holy Spirit.
Each individual is a Temple of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, a Temple is
formed wherever a New Covenant congregation gathers together in faith.
Prophecy is given to all and the gifts of the Holy Spirit are poured out upon
us. Jew and Gentile are now one in the Messiah. The Law has been written
upon our hearts, and we are moved by the Spirit to obey God. As for the
Mosaic writings, its teachings and principles are to be applied to the New
Covenant Order. This is the teaching of Yeshua and Paul (<u>Matthew
5:17-18</u>; <u>2 Timothy 3:16-17</u>) and it is their example to quote from
Moses to settle issues.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In addition, the New Covenant enjoins us to share the Gospel with all people
and to disciple the nations. Jew and Gentile in the Messiah are now one in
fellowship, foreshadowing the day when Israel and the nations will be one
under the rule of the Messiah. Thus there is a change in the application of
Mosaic <i>Torah</i>. The restriction that physically uncircumcised men must
not join our Passover <i>Seder</i> is changed. Gentiles who are in Yeshua
may join us; they have circumcised hearts and are clean. In addition,
because of the power of Yeshua's sacrifice and the Spirit, accommodations in
the Mosaic Law (such as in <u>Matthew 19:8</u>) are seen as no longer
acceptable. Divorce laws are more stringent and slavery and polygamy are
forbidden, and so there is both continuity and discontinuity. We are now
under the New Covenant, a covenant said to be not like the Covenant given
through Moses (<u>Jeremiah 31:31ff</u>). There is now no physical Temple;
therefore, we need to think through the meaning of clean and unclean laws
whose violation usually required temporary preclusion (until evening or for
seven days) from Temple involvement. Also, some of the clean-unclean laws, if
intentionally violated, required severe penalties. Today, these are
connected to higher moral meanings with contemporary application; an example
is the holiness of blood.) This gives some sense of where we see the New
Covenant as differing from the Mosaic. We should note that the New Covenant
replaces the administration of the Mosaic Covenant, but does not replace or
alter the Abrahamic Covenant. Rather, as McComiskey taught, the New Covenant
is the permanent administration of the Abrahamic Covenant. The New Covenant
is based on the fulfillments of the Messiah's crucifixion and resurrection,
and the outpouring of the Spirit.

One of the more universal dimensions of the Messianic Jewish task is to
reassert the fact that God has not changed in His desire for justice and for
establishing His righteous order in every realm of life. Some Classical
Christian theology was clear on this (e.g. Calvin and Kuyper). By contrast,
"Darby-ite" theology opted out of social responsibility. We pray
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"</i>Your Kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is
in heaven"</font> (<u>Matthew 6:10</u>). We read of the Messiah,
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"<i>He will not fail or be discouraged till he has
established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law</i>"</font> (<u>Isaiah 42:4</u> RSV). In the Age to Come the Messiah will have
established justice. It is now through us that He seeks to establish it. It
is part of our witness and calling to exhibit the righteous order of God in
every sphere of life we touch to the fullest extent of our Spirit-led
influence. This means that in our business life, congregational life
(including the standards of congregational discipline), our family order
(<u>Ephesians 5</u>), our artistic life and our citizenship responsibility.
Scientists also have a Kingdom calling rooted in <u>Genesis 1:26 ff</u>. In
the Bible, justice and love are not in opposition. Micah says we are to do
justice and love mercy (<u>Micah 6:8</u>). Therefore, the pursuit of God's
righteous order in every sphere of life is an expression of the second of the
two greatest commandments - to love our neighbors as ourselves. To pursue
justice from a motive of love for the sake of the Glory of God is to love our
neighbors.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Everywhere in the Bible exhorts us to this. However, anti-law
theology of recent years has influenced many to not pursue the order of God's
righteousness for the various spheres of life in which we are involved.
Charles Coleson has applied biblical <i>Torah</i> teaching to our penal
system, and rightly so. We have little to say to the concerns of society
without the <i>Torah</i>. We could say that love for God and man are
expressed by worship and the pursuit of love-justice. Justice (or God's
order of righteousness) is defined by His Word or <i>Torah</i> - not by the
Marxist or socialist deception of absolute equality. It is equality before
the Law of God, but includes a place for varieties of talents, gifts,
callings and outcomes. In the international scene, justice occurs when
Jerusalem is the capital of the world, and Israel and the nations are in
proper relationship under the rule of the Messiah.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The goal of God is that the <font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size=3>"<i>Torah</i> will go forth from
Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalems"</font> (<u>Micah 4:2</u>). The
goal of the Gospel (the New Covenant) is the establishment of the
<i>Torah</i>, the Rule of God, and the Kingdom of God. As we pursue God's
righteous order, we move history to its climax which is the return of the
Lord. We will only see partial manifestations of the Kingdom now but these
manifestations are a crucial part of our witness. When God's Kingdom holds
greater sway in a society, conditions for all improve markedly. Indeed,
bringing the Gospel to the nations and discipling are the first order of
business in pursuing justice because unless people are born again, they
cannot submit to the Rule or <i>Torah</i> of God.

This book suggests a Messianic Jewish <i>halakhic</i> approach to the various
commandments and laws (explicit and implied) that are found in the Bible. It
does not claim to be <i>halakhah</i> because it is not a body of rules that
any community has adopted as binding on its members. It nevertheless
presents a way of thinking that seeks to apply the Mosaic <i>Torah</i> (and
also other parts of the Bible) to the New Covenant order and to contemporary
life. As such, we have categorized the Law into basic subject divisions for
a more coherent presentation. One will see by this that the easy distinction
of Ceremonial and Moral Law does not fly, nor was it ever consistently
applied in any tradition of Christianity. Categorizing by subject does have
the disadvantage of not following the classical listing of 613 laws. In a
study of the laws and commandments, one will find that 613 is somewhat
arbitrary since some are repeated and not categorized well by subject.
However, because this is the classical Jewish way of putting forth the
biblical commandments, we will put traditional citations next to each
commandment or law being discussed, so that one can find it in Jewish lists
and commentaries.

In applying the Law we will discuss the traditional Jewish consensus,
applications made in the New Testament, Classical Christian applications, and
our concluding position. One will see that most of the <i>Torah</i> is not
so difficult to understand and apply. Two men are working on this project,
so if we do not agree on the final interpretation and application, we will
make our differences known. This is a very Jewish way to deal with the
issues. We trust that this book will aid in training in personal and social
ethics for all believers and will point out specific applications for Jewish
calling.
