        food-related, ceremony-
    - title: related, and spiritually.  Persons afflicted with sores (especially sores
        of leprosy) were deemed
    - title: “unclean,” as were people with bodily discharges and women during menses
        and after childbirth.
    - title: Also, certain animals were declared unclean, and people and objects touching
        something unclean
    - title: (e.g. a human carcass) could render unclean the object or person who
        did the touching.  All
    - title: matters of cleanness (including hygienic) had ceremonial consequences

    - title: especially regarding access to the Sanctuary and the performance of priestly
        functions.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: God gave us our minds, bodies, and emotions, and they can cause us to
        sin if we allow them.  On
    - title: the other hand, Scripture tells us that we who are born again have the
        mind of Messiah and can
    - title: therefore bring our minds under control to not only keep our thoughts
        pure, but also to keep our
    - title: bodies from sinning in response to our emotions.  We cannot control our
        feelings and emotions
    - title: directly, but emotions unaccompanied by sinful actions are not themselves
        sins.  If we exercise
    - title: control of our minds to control our bodies’ responses and actions, our
        feelings and emotions will
    - title: follow suit and be brought under control as well.  It is a protective
        mechanism given us by God,
    - title: but it requires that we engage our will to not sin.

      title: The Priesthood of Israel & of Believers in Yeshua
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: The term “Kingdom of God” (in the NKJ) occurs throughout the New Testament,
        whereas
    - title: “Kingdom of Heaven” occurs only in the Book of Matthew.  Some make a
        distinction between
    - title: them, but I do not because, in my view, God’s Kingdom is everywhere that
        God is.  God the
    - title: Father resides in Heaven and now (in the New Covenant) the Holy Spirit
        resides on earth –
    - title: within “born-again” believers.  It is therefore logical that God’s Kingdom
        is in both places as
    - title: well.
    - title: The commandment to “seek God’s Kingdom” is understood by some to mean
        merely that we
    - title: should seek salvation – eternal life with God.  That is correct, but
        its meaning is broader; it is to
    - title: seek to be with God always – on earth during our lives, and in Heaven
        when we pass on.  And it
    - title: is not only to be with God (ie. in God’s presence), but to have a personal
        father/son/daughter
    - title: relationship with Him wherever we are.
    - title: One more thing.
    - title: Matthew 6:33
    - title: exhorts us to not only to seek God’s Kingdom, but to seek it

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: People and things can be defiled.  When something is defiled, it is made
        impure or unclean, and
    - title: therefore unsuitable for its intended use.  In Scripture, its meaning
        is to make a thing or a person
    - title: unclean and unholy, i.e., unsuitable for ministry or for entering the
        Tabernacle (later the
    - title: Temple).  In Scripture, the defilement of a person occurs when a person
        either sins or comes into
    - title: contact with an unclean or prohibited object or substance.  There are,
        however, exceptions.  In
    - title: the Mosaic Covenant, a woman was made unclean for a short time after
        giving birth –
    - title: presumably due to its association with blood and the temporary unhealed
        condition of her body.
    - title: She was not, however, referred to as defiled.  Similarly, a person with
        bodily sores was
    - title: considered unclean but not defiled.  For purposes of this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: (and in the New Covenant),
    - title: defilement is understood to be the result of sin.  We are therefore commanded
        not to sin in the
    - title: first place, to repent when we do, and to keep away from people, things,
        and situations that

        be claiming that it is
    - title: wrong and bad for a woman to identify as female (right and good) because
        it diminishes her
    - title: importance.  Another might be claiming that it is wrong and bad for married
        couples to have
    - title: children (right and good) because having children increases the world’s
        population and puts a
    - title: burden on its resources.
    - title: The opposite, calling “right and good” that which is “wrong and bad”
        is what is often called
    - title: justification.
    - title: The opposite (calling right and good claiming that it is right and good
        for a man to divorce his
    - title: wife to marry another woman with whom he has fallen in love because God
        commands husbands
    - title: to love their wives.  The opposite (claiming what is right and good to
        be wrong and bad) is
    - title: similarly evil.

    - title: When we willfully receive Yeshua as our Lord and Messiah, we are said
        to be “born again”
    - title: because we become new creations in our spirit.  Our old nature (our old
        spirit) is replaced by a

        are three spirits
    - title: involved and they should not be confused.  The first two (the old and
        new spirits) are our human
    - title: spirits and the Holy Spirit is, of course, God’s Spirit.  There is another
        kind of spiritual
    - title: transaction with which this should not be confused, and that is the “immersion
        (baptism) of the
    - title: Holy Spirit.  That is when the Holy Spirit indwells us alongside our
        human spirit.  It is often
    - title: experienced as a second spiritual event that enhances (does not initially

    - title: spiritual nature.

    - title: defined in

    - title: of the CJB as “being confident of what we hope for, convinced about
    - title: things we do not see.”  The difficulty about faith that requires perseverance
        is that being sure of
    - title: something without seeing it is contrary to our unaided human instinct.  We
        are also told to stand
    - title: firm in our faith, and that is because we tend to slip back from faith
        even having achieved it, if
    - title: the goal for which we are believing is not realized in a relatively short
        time.  Finally, we are
    - title: called to grow in our faith, and that is achieved through practice in
        much the same way as

        it becomes to achieve it
    - title: and maintain it.

      title: Being Compassionate & Merciful Toward Our Neighbor
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Being tenderhearted and being compassionate are similar.  The subtle
        difference is that being
    - title: tenderhearted is a continuous and independent condition, whereas being
        compassionate requires
    - title: an external animate being for which or for whom to have compassion.  One
        can therefore be
    - title: tenderhearted in the absence of an external need but one cannot be compassionate
        without also
    - title: being tenderhearted.  In translations of the Bible, the terms appear
        to be interchangeable.
    - title: One may ask how God can require us to be tenderhearted.  Isn’t it a condition
        of our personality
    - title: that is God-given or inherited?  The answer is that tenderheartedness
        is a godly trait, the absence
    - title: of which is the result of our fallen condition.  When we willfully receive
        Yeshua the Messiah
    - title: into our heart and make him Lord, we experience a rebirth of our spirit
        that softens our heart
    - title: toward God, toward our fellow man, and toward God’s other created beings
        as well.

    - title: The words “Clean” and “unclean” in the Tanach typically refer to physical

    - title: people who have recently given birth, are unhealthy, or are dead.  The
        one who touches any of

    - title: meaning as well but have added to it being clean and unclean of heart
        and spirit.
    - title: There is a saying derived from Scripture that we are to be in the world
        but not of the world.  Its
    - title: meaning is that while we live “in the world” and minister “in the world,”
        we are not to “touch”
    - title: the spiritually unclean things of the world in a way that they will rub
        off on us and make us “of

    - title: Translators of the Bible employ the two words (in their various forms)
        to indicate our profound
    - title: appreciation of God’s provisions and blessings.  There is a small definitional
        difference between
    - title: the two words; being thankful is wholly cognitive, whereas being grateful
        adds a component of
    - title: feeling.  It is doubtful that the translators discern the difference
        so, when reading Scripture, we
    - title: can consider the words to be synonymous.

    - title: difference between being “joyful” and being “happy.”  Happiness is a

    - title: Faith and trust in God as translated in the Scriptures are synonymous,
        and in
    - title: Hebrews 11:1-3
    - title: we
    - title: 'read:'
    - title: “Trusting [faith] is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about
        things we do not
    - title: see. It was for this that Scripture attested the merit of the people
        of old.  By trusting [faith],
    - title: we understand that the universe was created through a spoken word of
        God, so that what is
    - title: seen did not come into being out of existing phenomena.”
    - title: Also,
    - title: Romans 10:17
    - title: 'says of faith:'
    - title: “So trust [faith]comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through
        a word
    - title: proclaimed about the Messiah.”
    - title: (CJB)
    - title: “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
    - title: (NKJ)
    - title: The “hearing” referred to in
    - title: Romans 10:17
    - title: is through the Holy Spirit, and it can come
    - title: prophetically or through inspired revelation of Scripture.  What is most
        important about faith is
    - title: that it is the way through which we relate to God; that is why
    - title: Hebrews 11:6

      title: Telling the Truth
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Faithfulness is the quality of being dependable in one’s attemp to carry
        out a task or duty.
    - title: Trustworthiness is similar but includes assurance that the person one
        trusts will not veer from the
    - title: given task through lack of wisdom or temptation and that the means he
        or she chooses to carry
    - title: out the task will be the best or at least appropriate.  Loyalty (also
        fidelity) is maintaining devoted
    - title: attachment to a person, task or principle and the assurance that one
        cannot not be lured to
    - title: another.  Faithfulness, trustworthiness and loyalty are grouped herein
        into a single Mitzvah
    - title: because a person cannot be one of them without also being the other two.
    - title: Faithfulness, trustworthiness, and loyalty are virtues only so long as
        the people, entities, or
    - title: principles to which they are applied are themselves virtuous or at least
        one believes them to be
    - title: virtuous.  Their application in the Bible and in this Mitzvah is to God,
        Yeshua, and to brother
    - title: believers, and unless they are said to be otherwise, they are considered
        virtues in all biblical
    - title: contexts.

      title: Judging Our Neighbor
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Hypocrisy is advocating a standard or belief to which we ourselves do
        not adhere, or to which
    - title: our behaviors do not conform.  We sometimes hear that we should not preach
        to our brother to
    - title: do that which we ourselves do not do because it is hypocritical.  It
        is indeed hypocritical, but it is
    - title: not a correct saying.  The correct saying is revealed in
    - title: Matthew 7:4-5
    - title: ':'
    - title: “How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the splinter out of your
        eye,' when you have
    - title: the log in your own eye?  You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your
        own eye; then you
    - title: will see clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother's
        eye!”
    - title: We should not hesitate to bring correction our brother when it is needed;
        however we should
    - title: correct ourselves first so that our subsequent correction of our brother
        will not be hypocritical.

      title: Keeping Our Promises
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: A vow is a solemn promise; an oath is also a promise, but one that invokes
        an authority such as a
    - title: god, a king, or an entity of similar importance.  Covenants are enforceable
        promises that are
    - title: usually bilateral – i.e. exchanged between individuals.  Covenants can
        also be unilateral and,
    - title: when they are, they are usually accompanied by a sign or seal.
    - title: Most references to promises in the Bible are about God keeping his promises
        to men and men to
    - title: God.  The New Testament has a few references to human beings keeping
        their promises to other
    - title: human beings and the
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: has more, but they tend to be about specific obligations such as
    - title: fidelity in commercial transactions.  All of this notwithstanding, keeping
        promises is a godly
    - title: virtue for which we are held accountable by both God and man.  The covenant
        promise of
    - title: fidelity in marriage is one of the most important.

        trait if its goal and
    - title: means of achieving it are themselves godly (e.g.,
    - title: Romans 15:20).
    - title: Selfish ambition, on the other
    - title: hand, is not godly and we are commanded against it.  It is the sinful
        promotion of self-interest in
    - title: disregard or at the expense of others.  It typically begins with coveting
        something of interest or
    - title: value that is possessed or owned by another, and then developing a desire
        and motivation to take
    - title: it for one’s self.

      title: Blaspheming God vs. Receiving Messiah & the Holy Spirit
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Blasphemy is speaking profanely, disrespectfully, irreverently or in
        an insulting manner about
    - title: God or something sacred.  Yeshua was accused of blasphemy by the Cohen
        haGadol in
    - title: Matthew
    - title: 26:64-65
    - title: 'when Yeshua identified with God and said: “But I tell you that one day
        you will see the'
    - title: Son of Man sitting at the right hand of
    - title: HaG'vurah
    - title: and coming on the clouds of heaven."  Also
    - title: John 10:33
    - title: ': “The Judeans replied, "We are not stoning you for any good deed, but
        for'
    - title: blasphemy- because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to
        be God.”
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: includes not
    - title: blaspheming against the Holy Spirit among other sacred entities.
    - title: Nevertheless, blaspheming against the Holy Spirit is special because
    - title: Matthew 12:31-32
    - title: tells us
    - title: that it is the only blasphemy that is unforgiveable.  It is therefore
        listed and dealt with separately

    - id: A09
      title: Swearing Falsely
    commentary_juster:
    - title: I am of the opinion that, in his "Sermon on the Mount," Yeshua preaches
        a higher standard for
    - title: truth-telling and for verbalizing oaths than the one commonly practiced
        in his day; his
    - title: exhortation is to return us to the standard that was always implied in
        the
    - title: Torah
    - title: . Yeshua is saying
    - title: that our truthfulness as believers and our commitment to doing what we
        say we will do should
    - title: have such integrity, that oaths become unnecessary among us. This would
        limit our oath-taking
    - title: to public law contexts where it is required for testifying in court and
        for entering into certain
    - title: contracts. As Yeshua-believers, we should become known for our trustworthiness.
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This is a particularly difficult
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: to understand because the words of the Tanach seem to
    - title: contradict those of the New Testament.
    - title: Deuteronomy 10:20
    - title: 'states: “You are to fear ADONAI'
    - title: your God, serve him and swear by his name.” and
    - title: Leviticus 19:12
    - title: 'states: “Do not swear by my'
    - title: name falsely,.”  Both of these infer that swearing an oath is authorized
        so long as it is in God’s
    - title: name and not sworn falsely.  However,
    - title: James 5:12,
    - title: 'states: “Above all, brothers, stop swearing'
    - title: oaths- not "By heaven," not "By the earth," and not by any other formula;”
        which seems to
    - title: preclude swearing oaths altogether.
    - title: The issue is discussed more fully in
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: '#A9 in Volume #1 of this compilation but, since'
    - title: publishing that volume, I have come to believe that, among the various
        possible explanations,
    - title: Dr. Daniel C. Juster’s opinion that follows is most likely correct, especially
        as to oaths required
    - title: by public law.

    - title: and everything we think we are hearing from the Holy Spirit.  This process
        of checking and
    - title: comparing is what we call discernment, and it would be simple if the

    - title: were written centuries ago, and in contexts that no longer exist, were
        always easy to apply in
    - title: today’s world and in our immediate circumstances.  The fact is that we
        cannot be sure that we
    - title: understand the Scriptures unless we seek and are sure that we are hearing
        the Holy Spirit’s
    - title: interpretation.  This puts us in a bind when what we are checking is

    - title: Holy Spirit correctly in the first place.  The solution for this is not

    - title: Spirit (meaning God’s voice) well.  If we do, then when we seek confirmation

    - title: Whereas the term “works” is not used in the text of this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: ', “works” is what we are usually'
    - title: addressing when talking about “doing right and good.”
    - title: James 2:26
    - title: tells us that “faith without
    - title: actions (works) is dead” and the “works” it is speaking of are, of course,
        “good” works.  It is also
    - title: not possible to distinguish between works that are right and those that
        are good.  All of
    - title: Torah
    - title: and, in fact, all things godly, are both right and good.
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is closely related to several others but especially to
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: '#DA12: “Being Good'
    - title: '& Kind to One Another.”  Actions that are good are often so because
        they are good to and for'
    - title: people, although some are good for animals, other aspects of God’s creation,
        and God Himself.
    - title: It may seem presumptuous that we can do anything good for God, but we
        can by caring for His
    - title: creation, and by connecting to Him through prayer and obedience.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: To understand this Mitzvah, one must first understand what has come to
        be known as the
    - title: Abrahamic Covenant that is described in
    - title: Genesis 17:1-16,
    - title: 'highlights of which are:'
    - title: “When Avram was 99 years old ADONAI appeared to Avram and said to him,
        "I am El
    - title: Shaddai [God Almighty]. Walk in my presence and be pure-hearted."”
    - title: '“As for me, this is my covenant with you: you will be the father of
        many nations.  Your name'
    - title: will no longer be Avram [exalted father], but your name will be Avraham
        [father of many],
    - title: because I have made you the father of many nations.”
    - title: “I am establishing my covenant between me and you, along with your descendants
        after you,
    - title: generation after generation, as an everlasting covenant, to be God for
        you and for your
    - title: descendants after you.”
    - title: '"As for you, you are to keep my covenant, you and your descendants after
        you, generation'
    - title: after generation.  Here is my covenant, which you are to keep, between
        me and you, along
    - title: 'with your descendants after you: every male among you is to be circumcised.  You
        are to be'
    - title: circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; this will be the sign of the
        covenant between me and
    - title: you.  Generation after generation, every male among you who is eight
        days old is to be
    - title: circumcised, including slaves born within your household and those bought
        from a foreigner
    - title: not descended from you.  The slave born in your house and the person
        bought with your
    - title: money must be circumcised; thus my covenant will be in your flesh as
        an everlasting
    - title: covenant.  Any uncircumcised male who will not let himself be circumcised
        in the flesh of his
    - title: foreskin- that person will be cut off from his people, because he has
        broken my covenant."
    - title: Covenants can be bilateral or unilateral.  A bilateral covenant comes
        into existence when two
    - title: parties agree to perform in some way.  The covenant referred to above
        that was made with
    - title: Abraham and his descendants (even those yet unborn) was not bilateral
        – it was unilateral.
    - title: Abraham and his descendants (later called “Israelites” or “Jews”) could
        individually violate it by
    - title: refusing circumcision, but there was nothing for them to promise or to
        do to bring it into
    - title: existence.  God simply gave it to them, and its purpose was to identify
        the children of Israel as a
    - title: priestly servant-nation that all would see was obedient to God and through
        whom God could
    - title: reach all the other nations of the world.
    - title: The Hebrew for circumcision of the flesh is
    - title: “b’rit milah”
    - title: – literally “covenant cutting.”  It is an
    - title: act of commanded covenantal obedience and a visible witness to the Gentile
        nations of Israel’s
    - title: relationship with God.  There is, however, a higher kind of covenant
        circumcision to which
    - title: circumcision of the flesh points; it is “circumcision of the heart,”
        and it too involves obedience –
    - title: not out of command, but out of love.  This kind of “covenant cutting”
        is not only for the Jew but
    - title: also for the Gentile, and there is another difference.  The covenant
        of “heart circumcision” is
    - title: bilateral in that God offers it, and it only becomes a reality in the
        life of each individual that
    - title: accepts it.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is similar to
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: '#GB60 in that passions and emotions are related to and part of'
    - title: sensuality.
    - title: Sensuality is the enjoyment, expression or pursuit of things to do with
        our senses, i.e. feelings –
    - title: especially feelings of pleasure, often sexual.
    - title: 2 Corinthians 5:7
    - title: (NKJ) tells us that we “walk by
    - title: faith and not by sight.”  The “sight” referred to is not just eyesight;
        it is anything our bodies see,
    - title: hear, smell, taste, feel, or otherwise detect and react to from external
        sources.  There is a level to
    - title: which such perceptions are normal and God-given, such as seeing danger
        and turning aside or
    - title: feeling the pain of something hot and avoiding being burned.  Those are
        not the kinds of
    - title: “sensuality” that we are to avoid and, in fact, not all sensuality is
        to be avoided.  Sexual pleasure
    - title: is sensual, and when experienced appropriately within marriage is good
        and healthy.  What this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: speaks against is “giving ourselves” to sensuality – i.e. allowing sensuality
        to rule us.
    - title: The Apostle Paul could very well have said in
    - title: '2 Corinthians 5:7:'
    - title: “For we walk by faith, not by
    - title: sensuality.”

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: that is about being blameless is similar to the several
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: listed above that
    - title: direct us to be godly, holy, righteous, good, pure, decent, etc.  In
        writing this volume we could
    - title: have joined them into a single
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: were it not for the fact that the Bible speaks of each
    - title: separately.  So, what is unique about being blameless, and how can Scripture
        direct us to aspire
    - title: to blamelessness when at the same time
    - title: Romans 3:22-32
    - title: tells us that “all have sinned and come
    - title: short of earning God’s praise?”  And how can David, the writer of
    - title: Psalms 26:1
    - title: ', tell God “I have'
    - title: lived a blameless life; unwaveringly” when the Bible reveals that he
        sinned by causing Uriah the
    - title: Hittite’s death so he could continue his adulterous relationship with
        Uriah’s wife?
    - title: These seeming inconsistencies can only be reconciled if being blameless
        is not synonymous with
    - title: being sinless so, the question then becomes how can one say that one
        is (or has been) blameless
    - title: after one has sinned?  And how can one aspire to be blameless when it
        is almost certain that one
    - title: will eventually sin?  Some say that David wrote
    - title: Psalms 26:1
    - title: before his sins involving Uriah and
    - title: 'Bathsheba occurred.  But David also wrote the following:'
    - title: Psalms 25:6-7
    - title: Remember your compassion and grace, ADONAI; for these are ages old.  Don't
        remember
    - title: my youthful sins or transgressions; but remember me according to your
        grace for the sake of
    - title: your goodness, ADONAI.
    - title: Psalms 25:11
    - title: For the sake of your name, ADONAI, forgive my wickedness, great though
        it is.
    - title: Psalms 25:18
    - title: See my affliction and suffering, and take all my sins away.
    - title: Psalms 143:2
    - title: Don't bring your servant to trial, since in your sight no one alive would
        be considered
    - title: righteous.
    - title: There can be only one answer; it is that when David repented of his sins
        he had prophetic incite
    - title: and faith that God would somehow and one day “take all my sins away”
        (
    - title: Psalms 25:18)
    - title: .
    - title: We are in a much better position than David.  If we, with faith in Yeshua
        repent of our sins, beg
    - title: God for forgiveness, and receive Yeshua’s sacrifice as our own, we become
        as clean and
    - title: blameless as if we had never sinned.  Therefore, for us who are in the
        New Covenant, aspiring to
    - title: be blameless is the same as aspiring to have faith in the cleansing blood
        of Yeshua.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: It is a surprise to some from reading
    - title: 1 Samuel 15:23
    - title: to learn that “rebellion is like the sin of
    - title: sorcery.”  After all, the very founding of our country was achieved by
        rebelling against British
    - title: rule, and we never thought of that as sinful.  Later we learned from
    - title: Romans 12:9
    - title: that we are to
    - title: “recoil from what is evil,” which sounds very much like “rebelling” against
        evil, and that is
    - title: certainly not sinful.
    - title: The key to untangling what seem like contradictions is understanding
        that rebellion by itself is
    - title: not sinful.  Whether or not rebellion is sinful depends on what one is
        rebelling against.  The
    - title: context of
    - title: 1 Samuel 15:2-23
    - title: is Sha’ul’s rebellion against God by rejecting His Word, and the
    - title: context of
    - title: 1 Timothy 1:9
    - title: is being “heedless of
    - title: Torah
    - title: ” and being “sinful, wicked and worldly”  –
    - title: hence the statement of this
    - title: 'Mitzvah:'
    - title: “We are not to rebel against God’s authority.”
    - title: Additional Comment by Daniel C. Juster
    - title: Acts 5:29
    - title: 'tells us: “We must obey God, not men.”  Consequently, we must rebel
        against human'
    - title: authority when it requires that we violate God’s law.  The Revolutionary
        War was such a
    - title: situation.  The argument that was given at the time or the Revolution
        that the British were in
    - title: rebellion against God’s natural laws is a hard sell in Britain even to
        this day.

        (supported by

      title: Testing Everything that is Spoken in God’s Name
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: 'A question that is sometimes asked is: “What is the difference between
        ‘testing’ and tempting?’'
    - title: The answer is that “tempting” is intentionally luring and desiring a
        person to do something he
    - title: would not ordinarily do (e.g committing sin), while “testing” makes available
        to a person the
    - title: opportunity to do something in order to find out whether he will do it.  The
        two are connected
    - title: when God tests us through trials (
    - title: James 1:2-4 & 12)
    - title: or by allowing Satan (through our flesh) to
    - title: tempt us (
    - title: James 1:13-14)
    - title: .  We also read in
    - title: Genesis 3:1-6
    - title: of how Satan successfully tempted
    - title: Eve, and in
    - title: Matthew 4:1-11
    - title: of how he tried (unsuccessfully) to tempt Yeshua.
    - title: But Scripture (as reflected in this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: ) commands us not to test God (including Yeshua and
    - title: the Holy Spirit); why is it wrong to test God?  It is wrong because God
        has revealed Himself and
    - title: His will for us in Scripture; putting God to the test is therefore saying
        that we do not believe the
    - title: Scriptures or that we do not believe God.  Why do men sometimes test
        God?  Mostly to
    - title: determine the limits of sin they can commit without being punished.  They
        typically do it by
    - title: committing a sin they desire to commit and then wait for God to respond.  If
        they receive no
    - title: immediate response, they become emboldened, believing that they can repeat
        the sin with
    - title: impunity.
    - title: 'Note:'
    - title: An apparent exception is
    - title: Malachi 3:10
    - title: 'in which God invites being tested:'
    - title: '3'
    - title: “Bring the whole tenth into the storehouse, so that there will be food
        in my house, and put me
    - title: to the test," says ADONAI-Tzva'ot. "See if I won't open for you the floodgates

      title: Resting & Returning Ownership of Our Land in the Jubilee Year
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: The purpose of resting is to receive refreshment and renewal.  Various
        Scriptures command us to
    - title: rest from work weekly and annually on the various Sabbaths, and to rest
        our souls in God,
    - title: Yeshua, and the Holy Spirit always.  Because Yeshua and the Holy Spirit
        are echad with God the
    - title: Father, this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: could well have had the title “Seeking Rest, Refreshment & Renewal in
    - title: God.”  However, because some Scriptures refer to Yeshua, some to the
        Holy Spirit, and some to
    - title: God, the authors herein decided to focus this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: on Yeshua and the Holy Spirit, and to
    - title: create a second
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: '#BA62 to discuss Scriptures that refer to God more broadly.'
    - title: “Rest,” “refreshment,” and “renewal” are related, but they are not the
        same and they can mean
    - title: different things in different contexts.  “Refreshment” means revitalization
        – giving fresh and
    - title: renewed strength.  It is a simple enough concept that applies to our
        bodies, souls, and spirits, so
    - title: we will not discuss it further.
    - title: “Rest” most commonly refers to the physical rest of our bodies that is
        needed for physiological
    - title: “renewal.”  The Scriptures that command we rest on the various Sabbaths
        include physical rest
    - title: but point to a higher kind of rest and renewal as well – rest of our
        souls and spirits by
    - title: surrendering ourselves to God and allowing Him to take our burdens and
        cares upon himself.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Yeshua describes himself as the vine, and “abiding” in him is more than
        living alongside him; it
    - title: is allowing our lives to be merged with his.  Scripture describes it
        as being in “unity” with him,”
    - title: being “unified with him,” and being “in union” with him – expressions
        that are used
    - title: interchangeably by the Bible translators.  When applied to our relationship
        with God (including
    - title: Yeshua and the Holy Spirit), Scripture calls us to be so “at one” with
        Yeshua and therefore with
    - title: God that our views are his views, and what we say and do are those things
        he would have us say
    - title: and do.  The ultimate is our being able to say that we are “in” him.
    - title: It is interesting that there are a plethora of Scriptures in the New
        Testament that speak of
    - title: mankind achieving intimacy with God, but there are relatively few in
        the
    - title: Tanakh.
    - title: The probable
    - title: reason is that prior to the New Covenant, ordinary Israelites did not
        have the same level of access
    - title: to the Holy Spirit (designated leaders such as Abraham, Moses, and David
        did of course) and it
    - title: is the Holy Spirit that enables us to “abide in Yeshua” and be in close
        union with God.  Note that
    - title: in
    - title: Psalms 51:13(11),

    - title: There are three ways that we can deny belief and faith in God and Yeshua.  The
        most obvious
    - title: and direct is through words stating our unbelief.  It is of course understandable
        if we truly do not

        might a believer
    - title: deliberately conceal his or her belief?  Perhaps to avoid persecution
        or even death in a hostile
    - title: circumstance but, even then, God would have to approve the denial for
        it not to be counted as
    - title: sin.
    - title: Another way that we can deny our belief and faith is through silence
        – i.e., allowing others to
    - title: continue in their incorrect assumption that we do not believe when in
        fact we do.  What was said
    - title: previously applies to this scenario as well.
    - title: There is a third way that we can deny belief and faith, and that is by

    - title: while allowing our conduct to violate God’s Word and standards.  This
        is the most egregious

    - title: If our understanding of this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: combined with
    - title: Luke 9:23
    - title: and
    - title: Romans 6:22
    - title: is merely literal,
    - title: we will conclude that God expects us to have no self-concerns or desires
        other than to give
    - title: ourselves to him.  As with most biblical interpretation, we can miss
        the meaning if we do not
    - title: consider the Bible as a whole.  Being God’s “slave” (as
    - title: Romans 6:22
    - title: puts it) is not what God
    - title: wants our relationship with him to be.  That is made clear in
    - title: Psalms 37:4
    - title: ':'
    - title: “Trust in ADONAI, and do good; settle in the land, and feed on faithfulness.  Then
        you will
    - title: delight yourself in ADONAI, and he will give you your heart's desire.”
    - title: Of course, our heart’s desire must be consistent with God’s moral values
        and his will for us and
    - title: for mankind.
    - title: Psalms 126:2,
    - title: Proverbs 10:28

    - title: Proverbs 17:22,
    - title: and
    - title: Ecclesiastes 9:7
    - title: illustrate more
    - title: of the lighter side of God’s will for us.
    - title: One may notice that, in comparison to the New Testament, there are relatively
        few references in
    - title: the Tanakh to offering ourselves to God; the Tanakh’s references to offerings
        are mostly to alter
    - title: sacrifices.  Nevertheless, giving ourselves to God is taught throughout
        the
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: using
    - title: expressions such as “presenting ourselves,” “worshipping,” “bowing down,”
        “being in union

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Faith, worship, thankfulness, and obedience are main components of our
        love relationship with
    - title: God (and Yeshua), and we are called by Scripture to please God and Yeshua
        in all of these.  To
    - title: do so requires that we put God ahead of our own interests and those of
        other people.  We cannot
    - title: divide our loyalties and still please God;
    - title: Galatians 1:10
    - title: 'teaches:'
    - title: Now does that sound as if I were trying to win human approval? No! I
        want God's approval!
    - title: Or that I'm trying to cater to people? If I were still doing that, I
        would not be a servant of the
    - title: Messiah.
    - title: We are often tempted to please men before God because in the natural
        we can see men whereas
    - title: we cannot see God who is a spirit.  That is why faith is needed and why
    - title: Hebrews 11:6
    - title: in the
    - title: 'NKJ version teaches:'
    - title: But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to
        God must believe that
    - title: He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: (from
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: '#W8 of Volume 2)'
    - title: Christian theologians have often misinterpreted (and sometimes mistranslated)
        the
    - title: Shaliach
    - title: Paul’s writings to be saying that the
    - title: mitzvot
    - title: (commandments of the
    - title: Torah
    - title: ) – the laws – the
    - title: statutes, ordinances, and judgments given at Mt. Sinai – were rendered
        uselessly obsolete by
    - title: Yeshua.  Those who hold that view teach that God’s law has been replaced
        by his grace, so that
    - title: if we love God and one another, none of the specifics of the “Mosaic
        Law” matter anymore.
    - title: '6'
    - title: Such views are in direct contradiction of Yeshua’s words in
    - title: Matthew 5:19
    - title: ', which says:'
    - title: “So whoever disobeys the least of these mitzvot and teaches others to
        do so will be called the
    - title: least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever obeys them and so teaches
        will be called great
    - title: in the Kingdom of Heaven.”
    - title: Also problematic, is the mistranslation (of
    - title: Matthew 5:17
    - title: of many Bible versions) of the Greek
    - title: word
    - title: “πληρῶσαι,”
    - title: that is commonly but incorrectly rendered “fulfill:”
    - title: Scriptures often cited to support this view include
    - title: Romans 6:14
    - title: and
    - title: 2 Corinthians 12:9
    - title: .
    - title: “Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not
        come to destroy but to
    - title: fulfill.”
    - title: (NKJ)
    - title: The word in this context should actually be translated “fill” (the CJB
        translates it “complete”).
    - title: These numerous mistranslations have fueled antinomians to teach that
        no part of God’s Law
    - title: given at Mount Sinai is to be obeyed today because Yeshua fulfilled it
        in Himself.
    - title: '7'
    - title: There is another Scripture whose misunderstanding has caused no little
        amount of controversy,
    - title: and that is
    - title: Matthew 19:17,
    - title: 'in which Yeshua tells a man:'
    - title: “But if you want to obtain eternal life, observe the mitzvot."
    - title: Yeshua seems to be saying that salvation comes from a legalistic observance
        of the law, whereas
    - title: we know from
    - title: Galatians 2:16
    - title: '(as well as other Scriptures) that:'
    - title: “.. a person is not declared righteous by God on the ground of his legalistic
        observance of
    - title: Torah commands, but through the Messiah Yeshua's trusting faithfulness.”
    - title: The answer to this seeming contradiction is, of course, that
    - title: Deuteronomy 18:15-19
    - title: of the Mosaic
    - title: Torah
    - title: prophesies the coming of Messiah Yeshua, and commands us to listen to
        him and obey
    - title: him, as he will be speaking in God’s Name.  So, to obey the
    - title: Torah,
    - title: is also to receive and obey
    - title: the
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: of Yeshua.
    - title: 'A final word:  This'
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: rests on my (and Daniel Juster’s) belief in the continued efficacy of
    - title: all the Scriptures of the
    - title: Torah
    - title: (
    - title: 2 Timothy 3:16-17)

        – his attributes – what

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: With Yeshua having now returned to Heaven, loving God the Father and
        Yeshua (also the Holy
    - title: Spirit) are essentially the same.  All three are people of God and spirit
        beings, and a question
    - title: often raised is how we can love a spirit being.  As in the case of
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: DA24 (Loving Our
    - title: Brother & Neighbor), the love we are commanded for God and Yeshua in
        the Greek New
    - title: Testament is “ἀγαπήσε” (“
    - title: agape
    - title: ”) and it is
    - title: ָּ֥  וְ א ָֽ הַ בְ ת
    - title: (“
    - title: v’ahavta,
    - title: ”) for God in the
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: .  This
    - title: kind of love does not imply emotion or feeling, but rather sacrificial
        responsibility.  In the case
    - title: of our brother and neighbor, that responsibility is to do what is in
        their best interest, but in the
    - title: case of God and Yeshua, it is to be obedient.  Love and obedience are
        connected throughout the
    - title: Scriptures, and never clearer than Yeshua’s words in
    - title: 'John 14:15:'
    - title: “If you love me, you will keep
    - title: my commands.”  That notwithstanding, there is a relational component
        of loving God that must
    - title: never be forgotten; it is having love for our Heavenly Father as we are
        his children.

      title: Knowing that God Is Echad & Triune
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: addresses the word “one” as it applies to God in English translations
        of the Bible.
    - title: 'There are three ways that the word “one” is used in the English Bible:
        the way it is not relevant'
    - title: in this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is when it is referring to a person or people (e.g. “the other one” or
        “one must).
    - title: The two ways that are relevant in this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: are (a) the singular number “1” as in a count of
    - title: objects (e.g. “one widget”) and (b) the corporate word “one” meaning
        a collective as in “we are
    - title: one in our purpose” (a single purpose held by multiple people) or “we
        are one band of men” (a
    - title: single band consisting of multiple men).
    - title: Similar to English where the word “one” can be used for either a singular
        or composite unity, the
    - title: Hebrew Bible uses the word “
    - title: echad.
    - title: ”  Its use of “
    - title: echad
    - title: ” in
    - title: Deuteronomy 6:4
    - title: (“
    - title: Adonai echad,
    - title: ”)
    - title: is translated “the Lord is one” and is meant as a composite unity.  When
        the Hebrew Bible
    - title: intends to say that there is only one God (a singular unity), it may
        still use the word “
    - title: echad
    - title: ',” so'
    - title: translators try to make it clear by using terms such as “only one,” “no
        other,” “You alone,” etc.
    - title: The significance of the word “
    - title: echad
    - title: ” as used in
    - title: Deuteronomy 6:4
    - title: is that it allows for God to be
    - title: triune (three in one) while still being one God and not three.  See
    - title: Mitzvah

    - title: “Fearing” God in
    - title: 1 Peter 2:17
    - title: '(CJB): “Be respectful to all- keep loving the brotherhood, fearing'
    - title: God ..” contradicts and not the same as being “afraid” of him as the
        word “fear” is used in
    - title: 1 John 4:18
    - title: '(NKJ): “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because
        fear'
    - title: involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.”  Being
        afraid of God and
    - title: at the same time loving him as in
    - title: Deuteronomy 6:5
    - title: '(NKJ): “with all your heart, with all your'
    - title: soul, and with all your strength” is not even possible.  Indeed, we are
        to appreciate God’s power
    - title: to discipline, but the kind of fear of God we are to have, is ideally

    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is about not putting other people and things ahead of God, which,

        lives that we keep
    - title: ourselves safe, happy, and fulfilled.  That notwithstanding, this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: requires that we forego
    - title: our personal desires and preferences when God, for his purposes, directs
        us to do so.  Our

        receiving back land,
    - title: animals, or people.  Redemption in this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: refers to receiving us back and saving us from
    - title: the disastrous consequence of our sins.  It is not an exaggeration to
        say that Yeshua’s atoning
    - title: sacrifice on the Roman stake was a ransom (a price) that he paid for
        our redemption –
    - title: forgiveness for our sins, restoration to righteousness, and release from
        bondage of sin and death.
    - title: Comment by Daniel C. Juster
    - title: The verses supporting this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: are not in command form but, as in many cases, they are
    - title: implied.  They all support the idea of believing in Yeshua, and that
        means all the biblical truths
    - title: about him.  As Paul says in
    - title: I Corinthians 15:3-5
    - title: ':'
    - title: '“For among the first things I passed on to you was what I also received,
        namely this: the'
    - title: Messiah died for our sins, in accordance with what the Tanakh says; and
        he was buried; and
    - title: he was raised on the third day, in accordance with what the Tanakh says;
        and he was seen by
    - title: Kefa, then by the Twelve;”
    - title: It implies that we, similar to the Corinthians, are to believe that Yeshua
        died for our sins which,
    - title: in turn, implies that we are to believe all else about him that Scripture
        reveals.

      title: Knowing God & Who He Is
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Acts of kindness and blessings are synonymous; they are acts of benevolence
        performed on
    - title: behalf of another, often not deserved.  It is especially true of the
        kindness that God has shown
    - title: and continues to show toward us, given the many times that we have sinned
        against him.  There
    - title: is no greater blessing of God and Yeshua than the one spoken of in
    - title: 'John 3:16-17:'
    - title: '"For God so'
    - title: loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone
        who trusts in him may
    - title: have eternal life, instead of being utterly destroyed.  For God did not
        send the Son into the world
    - title: to judge the world, but rather so that through him, the world might be
        saved.”
    - title: This is especially
    - title: impactful when one considers that God sent his sonYeshua into the world
        to give his life for sins
    - title: we committed and for which we (not he) deserved to die.  Even so, Yeshua
        in his immense
    - title: compassion beckoned to us in
    - title: 'Matthew 11:28-30:'
    - title: '"Come to me, all of you who are struggling'
    - title: and burdened, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn
        from me, because I am
    - title: gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  For

    - title: Matzah
    - title: is traditionally used at Passover meals (
    - title: sedarim
    - title: ) to remember the unleavened bread the
    - title: Israelites brought with them out of Egypt, and wine is traditionally
        used to represent the blood of
    - title: the lamb that was sacrificed and placed on the doorposts of Israelites’
        homes to save their
    - title: firstborn sons from the angel of death.   The
    - title: matzah
    - title: eaten by Ashkenazic Jews at their
    - title: sedarim
    - title: represents the lamb that was consumed at the original Passover, whereas
        Sephardic Jews serve
    - title: lamb as one of the Passover foods for the same reason.
    - title: Bread and wine have been used as far back as Abraham as elements for
        sealing covenants.  We
    - title: read in
    - title: 'Genesis 14:18-20:'
    - title: “Malki-Tzedek king of Shalem brought out bread and wine. He was cohen
        of El 'Elyon [God
    - title: 'Most High], so he blessed him with these words: "Blessed be Avram by
        El ''Elyon, maker of'
    - title: heaven of earth and blessed be El 'Elyon, who handed your enemies over
        to you." Avram
    - title: gave him a tenth of everything.”
    - title: At his last seder, Yeshua used
    - title: matzah
    - title: and wine in an unusual way but in a way that was
    - title: consistent with its historical covenantal meaning.  We read in
    - title: Matthew 26:26-28
    - title: ':'
    - title: “While they were eating, Yeshua took a piece of matzah, made the b'rakhah,
        broke it, gave it
    - title: to the talmidim and said, "Take! Eat! This is my body!"  Also he took
        a cup of wine, made the
    - title: b'rakhah, and gave it to them, saying, "All of you, drink from it!  For
        this is my blood, which
    - title: ratifies the New Covenant, my blood shed on behalf of many, so that they
        may have their sins
    - title: forgiven.”
    - title: We who are New Covenant believers in Yeshua understand this to be a sacrament
        intended for us
    - title: today as well.  We call it by various names such as “The Lord’s Table,”
        “Holy Communion,”
    - title: “
    - title: Seudat Ha-Adon
    - title: ',” etc., but how often and under what circumstances we are to take it
        is a matter'
    - title: of debate.  It was during a Passover seder that Yeshua lifted the
    - title: matzah
    - title: and wine and is quoted
    - title: in
    - title: 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 t
    - title: 'o have said:'
    - title: '"This is my body, which is for you. Do this as a memorial to me"; likewise
        also the cup after'
    - title: the meal, saying, "This cup is the New Covenant effected by my blood;
        do this, as often as
    - title: you drink it, as a memorial to me."
    - title: Some argue, therefore, that Yeshua meant for us to remember him with
        bread and wine only
    - title: during Passover.  Others argue that the words “as often as you drink
        it” mean any time we drink
    - title: wine, and still others say it simply means “often.”

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: The triune nature of God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), sometimes referred
        to as the “Trinity,” is
    - title: not described in the Bible in those very words, but it can be inferred
        from several Scriptures read
    - title: together – most notably
    - title: Matthew 28:18-19
    - title: .  The tri-unity of God is not acknowledged in
    - title: traditional (Rabbinical / Talmudic) Judaism and is controversial even
        in certain segments of
    - title: Christianity.  Some who believe that Yeshua (Jesus) is the Messiah, nevertheless,
        deny his deity.
    - title: Others believe that Yeshua is all of God – i.e., the Father, Son, and
        Holy Spirit in one person.
    - title: We call that belief “Jesus only.”   So far as I am aware, Messianic Judaism
        is entirely trinitarian
    - title: in its belief that God is
    - title: echad
    - title: (a composite unity), existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - title: While the three are integrally connected as “one” God, they are able
        to be at different places on
    - title: earth (also in Heaven and on earth) at the same time, and can function
        separately but always
    - title: cooperatively.  For example, we read in Scripture that Yeshua (originally
        spirit in nature) walked
    - title: on earth as a human being while, at the same time, the Holy Spirit impacted
        various individuals
    - title: and, all the while, God the Father remained in Heaven.  While the composite
        “oneness” of God
    - title: may be difficult to comprehend, it is not unique in Scripture.  The clearest
        example of it is in
    - title: Genesis 2:24

    - title: This is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his
        wife, and they are to
    - title: be one flesh
    - title: .”
    - title: Whereas they are one flesh, they are able to function separately and
        hopefully cooperatively.
    - title: Although Yeshua’s Messiahship is not acknowledged within wider Judaism,
        the Holy Spirit’s
    - title: ability to be (and function) on earth while God (presumably the Father)
        remains in Heaven is
    - title: acknowledged.  That notwithstanding, wider Judaism does not consider
        the Holy Spirit to be an
    - title: entity or component of a composite God; rather, it considers him to be
        a kind of spiritual
    - title: extension of God, and refers to him as “God’s Spirit” or “Spirit of God.”  The
        term
    - title: “
    - title: Ru’ach Ha-Kodesh
    - title: ” (the Holy Spirit) is used in
    - title: Psalms 51:13(11)
    - title: in which David prays to God
    - title: that he (David) is not taken away from God’s presence – that the
    - title: Ru’ach Ha-Kodesh
    - title: is not taken
    - title: from him.  The “
    - title: Ru’ach Ha-Kodesh
    - title: ” is also referred to in
    - title: Isaiah 63:10-11
    - title: in which the Holy
    - title: Spirit is remembered to have been put among the Israelites by God during
        the time of Moses.
    - title: Other times in Scripture, the Holy Spirit is referred to by terms such
        as the “
    - title: Shekinah
    - title: Glory.”
    - title: Such is the case in
    - title: Exodus 24:16-18
    - title: in which the
    - title: Shekinah
    - title: Glory rested on the Tabernacle, and
    - title: in

    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is one of the most useful and profound of all the commandments given
        us by God.
    - title: It speaks to circumstances where we have no human control over a situation,
        and we dread an
    - title: adverse result.  Our response in the natural is to become depressed and
        to comport ourselves in
    - title: ways that are unwise, unhelpful, and possibly even harmful.  In short,
        we allow our quality of
    - title: life to diminish, and all because we have disregarded this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: .to rely on God.
    - title: Yes, we should fervently pray for God to intervene in our behalf, but
        more than that!  We must
    - title: place ourselves, our loved ones and all we possess and hold dear in his
        care, and trust in him.
    - title: Notice I did not say “trust that the result will be to our liking.”  We
        can pray for a particular
    - title: outcome, but our faith must be for God’s will to be done.  If we allow
        it to be so, He will lift us
    - title: above all our cares and we will have the
    - title: shalom
    - title: of God that “surpasses all understanding.”

    - title: Everything to God in prayer.
    - title: Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
    - title: Oh, what needless pain we bear.
    - title: All because we do not carry,
    - title: Everything to God in prayer.
    - title: Have we trials and temptations?
    - title: Is there trouble anywhere?
    - title: We should never be discouraged,
    - title: Take it to the Lord in prayer.

    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is a direct refutation of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination.  In
        “The Institutes
    - title: 'of the Christian Religion,” John Calvin wrote:'
    - title: (Translated from French)
    - title: “By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined
        with himself
    - title: whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created
        on equal terms,
    - title: but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation;
        and, accordingly, as
    - title: each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he
        has been predestinated
    - title: to life or to death.”
    - title: Calvin taught that Yeshua’s atoning sacrifice was not available to all,
        but only to an elect who
    - title: were preordained to be saved.  Why then, would Yeshua send his disciples
        out to “make people
    - title: from all nations into talmidim, immersing them into the reality of the
        Father, the Son and the
    - title: Ruach HaKodesh
    - title: ..” (
    - title: Matthew 28:19
    - title: ')?  Why then, would the Bible tell us: “For God so loved the'
    - title: world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone who trusts
        in him may have eternal
    - title: life..” (
    - title: John 3:16)
    - title: '?'
    - title: Scripture suggests that God can sovereignly select certain ones of us
        for special treatment and
    - title: special assignments.  We are not all Abraham, we are not all Moses, we
        are not all Sha’ul, and

    - title: A mediator is someone who brings two parties together into agreement.  Before
        their expulsion
    - title: from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve did not need a mediator to converse
        with God because
    - title: God and they were in close covenantal relationship.  However, as a consequence
        of Adam’s
    - title: breach of covenant, humanity became more distant from God so, whereas
        God could speak
    - title: directly to whomever He wished, most men had to communicate through a
        priestly mediator of
    - title: God’s choosing.  God’s covenant with men changed several times over the
        years as God
    - title: graciously sought to bring men closer to him.  To assist, He selected
        priests to serve him – priests
    - title: such as Abraham, Moses, Aaron, David, and many others.  The priesthood
        of Aaron we know
    - title: about, but we do not usually think of Abraham, Moses, and David as being
        priests; yet they were
    - title: because they fulfilled the priestly role of representing mankind to God
        and God to mankind.  We
    - title: read in
    - title: Jeremiah 31

    - title: saw fit to give them a New and better Covenant, whereby God’s own son
        Yeshua came to earth,

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Temptations come to us from two sources – from Satan, and from the lusts
        and desires of our
    - title: flesh.  God sometimes uses these sources and our free will to test us
        through allowing us to be
    - title: tempted, but God does not himself tempt us.
    - title: But isn’t that just semantics?  Isn’t that God tempting us indirectly?  No,
        it is not.  “Tempting” is
    - title: intentionally luring and desiring a person to do something he would not
        ordinarily do (e.g
    - title: committing sin), whereas in “testing” us, God gives us the opportunity
        to commit sin in order to
    - title: find out whether we will; it is his hope that we will not.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: “Submitting” and “obeying” are (for all practical purposes) synonymous
        but are treated
    - title: separately in this compilation because the CJB uses both terms in its
        Bible translation (see
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: 'BA10).  Submitting to God requires: (1) knowing what God wants of us,
        and (2)'
    - title: complying with what God wants of us.  There are two ways to know what
        God wants of us (this
    - title: 'is beginning to sound like a lesson in mathematics): (a) knowing the'
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: contained in
    - title: Scripture, and (b) hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit who directs us
        in applying the
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: in
    - title: the various circumstances of our lives.  Knowing the
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: is straight forward; it requires
    - title: studying the Bible.  Hearing the Holy Spirit is less so because it involves
        our growing in spiritual
    - title: acuity and in our prayer relationship with God.  But now we come to number
        (2) above –
    - title: “complying.”  Most believers – even new believers – become pretty good
        about knowing what
    - title: God wants of us but have difficulty overcoming the obstacle of the flesh
        that tends to pull us in
    - title: the other direction.  This part of submitting to God is sometimes referred
        to as “dying to self”
    - title: and is briefly dealt with elsewhere in this compilation.

      title: Obeying the Commandments & Teachings of Yeshua
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: There are several ways that Scripture speaks of coming to Yeshua.  “Come
        to me,” in
    - title: Matthew
    - title: '11:28'
    - title: is clear because it uses the word “come.”  However, there are other ways
        that Scripture
    - title: says it as well, e.g., believing in Yeshua, trusting in Yeshua, calling
        on Yeshua’s name, and
    - title: others.  There is a difference between believing in Yeshua and merely
        believing about him – that
    - title: 'he is the Messiah.  The important question about coming to Yeshua is:
        “Have we made him OUR'
    - title: Messiah?”  To make him our Messiah, not only must we come to him; we
        must make him our
    - title: Lord which means giving our lives over to him.  Some rely on “what is
        known as the “Sinner’s
    - title: Prayer” – a prayer that invites Yeshua into our hearts and asks him to
        save us.  It works if we
    - title: mean it and does not if we speak it legalistically as a mere formula
        of words.
    - title: Resting in Yeshua means putting our cares upon him.  There are two Christian
        poems and hymns
    - title: that, in my opinion, capture the depth and emotion of coming to Yeshua
        and resting in him; the
    - title: first is titled “Just as I Am;”
    - title: '12'
    - title: 'the first three stanzas are:'
    - title: Just as I am, without one plea
    - title: But that Thy blood was shed for me
    - title: And that Thou bid'st me come to thee

    - title: With many a conflict, many a doubt,
    - title: Fightings and fears within, without,
    - title: O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
    - title: The second is titled “What a Friend We Have in Jesus;”
    - title: '13'
    - title: 'the first three stanzas are:'
    - title: What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!
    - title: What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
    - title: O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear,
    - title: All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.
    - title: Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?
    - title: We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer.
    - title: Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share?
    - title: Jesus knows our every weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer.
    - title: Are we weak and heavy laden, cumbered with a load of care?
    - title: Precious Savior, still our refuge, take it to the Lord in prayer.
    - title: Do your friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer!
    - title: In His arms He’ll take and shield you; you will find a solace there.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: When we receive Yeshua as Lord, we come into a union relationship with
        him and with God the
    - title: Father through him; this is known as being “born again” (
    - title: John 3:3-5
    - title: ;
    - title: 1 Peter 1:23)
    - title: .  So, why
    - title: does Scripture find it necessary to remind us to stand firm in that union?  Does
        God expect that
    - title: we will backslide into sin and unbelief?  The short answer is that God
        does not expect it but
    - title: knows it is possible because He has seen it happen before.  Adam and
        Eve were in a close union
    - title: relationship with God, and yet they gave in to believing what Satan said
        over what God said.
    - title: Scripture is replete with warnings to look out for Satanic attacks through
        false prophets and
    - title: temptations of our flesh because, when we become “born again,” we become
        targets for Satan to
    - title: try to do to us what he did to Adam.  That’s the bad news.  The good
        news is that through our
    - title: relationship with Yeshua, we have the Holy Spirit to help us fight off
        temptations of the flesh.
    - title: Still, as with Adam, we have free will to not do so, and that is why
        there are so many
    - title: admonitions that we stand firm in union with Yeshua.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Being called and chosen are related but are not the same.  Being called
        is being invited and being
    - title: chosen is being selected.  We read in Scripture that, throughout history,
        God chose various
    - title: individuals to carry out his objectives.  Some were chosen because they
        were godly and some
    - title: because they were evil.  Also, not all who were chosen were first called.  Because
        of his evil
    - title: nature, Judas Iscariot was chosen to be the betrayer of Yeshua; he was
        not called before he was
    - title: chosen.  Abraham, on the other hand, was first called and then chosen
        after being tested; we read
    - title: in
    - title: 'Hebrews 11:8:'
    - title: “By trusting, Avraham obeyed, after being called to go out to a place
        which God would give
    - title: him as a possession; indeed, he went out without knowing where he was
        going.”
    - title: He was tested in other ways as well and was subsequently chosen to become
        the “father of many
    - title: nations” (
    - title: Genesis 17:3-8)
    - title: .
    - title: There are other examples in Scripture of people called and chosen, but
        the one that is the subject
    - title: of this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is mankind’s call to receive Yeshua as Lord and thereby be chosen to
        have
    - title: eternal life.
    - title: Matthew 22:14
    - title: '(NKJ) tells us: “for many are called, but few are chosen."  The call'
    - title: to receive Yeshua is to all of mankind, but Scripture both recognizes
        and prophesies that
    - title: relatively few will heed the call, and therefore few will be chosen.
    - title: Note that
    - title: 2 Peter 1:10-11
    - title: 'is an exhortation to: “try even harder to make your being called and'
    - title: chosen a certainty.”  It is a warning to believers that if they are not

    - title: “Rest,” “refreshment,” and “renewal” are related, but they are not the

    - title: “renewal.”  The Scriptures that command we rest on the various Sabbaths
        include physical rest
    - title: but point to a higher kind of rest and renewal as well – rest of our

    - title: Because humans are fragile, it is natural for us to have desires and
        want to be secure from the
    - title: myriad of things that can beset us.  Wanting security and fulfillment
        of our desires is not the
    - title: usually the problem – in fact, God invites us to look to him and trust
        him for these things (see
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: BA44).  The problem is that too many of us do not trust God (whom we
        cannot see with
    - title: natural eyes) and instead seek security and fulfillment from things we
        can see – chief among
    - title: them being wealth (i.e., money and property).  Are we hungry?  Money
        can buy us food.  Are we
    - title: naked?  Money can buy us clothing.  Are we cold and wet?  Money can buy
        us shelter.  Are we
    - title: in danger from others?  Money can buy us protection and influence.  All
        of these are logical and
    - title: true to a point, but the right way to achieve them is through God.
    - title: 2 Timothy 1:7
    - title: 'says:'
    - title: “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love
        and of a sound mind.”
    - title: When we give in to fear and rely on our wealth instead of on God because
        we don’t trust that He
    - title: will come through for us, we break covenant with God and commit sin.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Two things should be clear about this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: (and its supporting Scriptures
    - title: Matthew 5:25
    - title: and
    - title: Luke 12:58-59
    - title: '):  (1) It assumes that we are likely wrong about whatever we are accused
        of; and'
    - title: (2) it instructs us to try to settle a grievance before appearing in
        court and without compromising
    - title: biblical principles or values.
    - title: We believe that, during the First Century, the Romans allowed Jewish
        courts (
    - title: betei din
    - title: ) to
    - title: adjudicate private disputes between Jews.  An accommodation such as that
        does not exist
    - title: between our secular courts and religious institutions today, yet
    - title: 1 Corinthians 6:1-7
    - title: is clear that
    - title: if a person suing us is a brother believer, he should not be doing so
        in a secular court.  He could,
    - title: however, do so in an ecclesiastical court (
    - title: beit din
    - title: ), so it is important that believing congregations
    - title: today (both Jewish and Christian) establish tribunals to adjudicate disputes
        and settle
    - title: controversies that arise in their midst.  Also, the Scriptures underlying
        this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: seem to
    - title: assume that we were wrong in whatever we are accused of because (they
        say) that if the matter
    - title: goes to court, it is likely that we will be “thrown into jail.”  The
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is therefore calling us to
    - title: try to settle our differences, but without compromising biblical values
        because (1) compromising
    - title: biblical values is forbidden by Scripture (i.e.,
    - title: Deuteronomy 5:29(32
    - title: ), and (2) because, the party
    - title: who has done something wrong, is required to repent and, if possible,
        make full restitution.
    - title: Subjects related to this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: (treated elsewhere in this compilation) are loving our neighbor,
    - title: not sinning against our neighbor, forgiving our neighbor, repenting of
        sin, and making restitution
    - title: when we do sin.  Also, most of the Scriptures in the Bible about disputes
        are about disputes
    - title: between believers, two of the most important being
    - title: Matthew 5:23-24
    - title: and
    - title: Matthew 18:15-17.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: assumes that an offense (a sin) has been committed (or is thought to
        have been
    - title: committed) either by (1) us against a brother believer, or (2) against
        us by a brother believer.
    - title: Matthew 5:23-24
    - title: speaks to the former and
    - title: Matthew 18:15-17
    - title: speaks to the latter.  If it is we who
    - title: have committed (or are accused of having committed) the offense, our
        obligation is clear; we are
    - title: to repent by going to our brother, confessing our sin, asking his forgiveness,
        making restitution
    - title: where possible, and attempting to reconcile our relationship.
    - title: If it is our brother who has committed (or is thought to have committed)
        the offense, there is a
    - title: step we must take before implementing the multi-step solution described
        in
    - title: Matthew 18:15-17
    - title: ; it
    - title: is to decide whether we should overlook the offense pursuant to
    - title: Proverbs 19:11
    - title: .  That is because
    - title: the alleged offense, while sinful, may have been committed innocently,
        may be too trivial to
    - title: pursue, or our relationship may more likely be left intact by our silently
        forgiving the offense and
    - title: not pursuing our brother in a formal way (
    - title: Ephesians 4:2)
    - title: .  We may, nevertheless, opt for
    - title: correcting our brother in love pursuant to
    - title: Galatians 6:1.
    - title: If we pursue an offense against our brother pursuant to
    - title: Matthew 18:15-17
    - title: ', there are three steps'
    - title: that we must take.  The first is to go to our brother, show him his fault,
        and seek reconciliation.
    - title: If our brother repents then we must forgive him and lay the matter to
        rest.  If he does not, we
    - title: should again consider whether we should let the matter drop and, if we
        elect not to do so,
    - title: Scripture instructs us to return to our brother with one or two others
        to be witnesses to our
    - title: conversation and interaction.  These witnesses will form their individual
        opinions of who is right
    - title: in the controversy, and will try to persuade the wrongdoer to repent.
    - title: Naturally, if it is we who are wrong, then we must repent to our brother.  However,
        if the
    - title: witnesses side with us, and our brother will not listen to them and repent,
        there is a third step that
    - title: we may pursue, which is to bring the matter to a
    - title: beit din
    - title: (ecclesiastical court) of a suitable
    - title: congregation or apostolic organization.  If the
    - title: beit din
    - title: rules against our brother and he will not
    - title: repent by complying with what the
    - title: beit din
    - title: requires of him, then
    - title: Matthew 18:17
    - title: says that our
    - title: brother is to be treated as a “pagan or a tax-collector,” which means
        an unbeliever.  This does not
    - title: mean shunning our brother unless he continues to sin while holding himself
        out as a believer, or
    - title: behaves in such a way as to be divisive in the community.  Such a finding
        allows the innocent
    - title: party to seek redress and restitution in the public courts as he would
        be able to do against an
    - title: unbeliever.  For a more detailed discussion of the foregoing, see

    - title: 1 Corinthians 6:1
    - title: 'in the CJB states:'
    - title: “How dare one of you with a complaint against another go to court before
        pagan judges
    - title: and not before God's people?” [b’nei din]
    - title: According to Jay P. Green, Sr.,
    - title: '17'
    - title: the Greek words
    - title: “
    - title: καὶ οὐχὶ
    - title: ”
    - title: in the verse mean “also not”
    - title: '18'
    - title: so,
    - title: 'if the verse were translated “and also not,” we have:'
    - title: “How dare one of you with a complaint against another go to court before
        pagan judges
    - title: and also not
    - title: before God's people?”
    - title: This seemingly minor change is not minor at all because the inclusion
        of that one word “also”
    - title: infers that two believers can litigate an issue in both courts – in a
        secular court so long as they
    - title: also bring the matter before a
    - title: bet din
    - title: .  Since it is unseemly to imbue a secular court with appeal
    - title: authority over a
    - title: beit din
    - title: and risks contradictory judgments if one litigates in the two courts
    - title: simultaneously, it is my belief that the only way for a believer to bring
        his or her dispute to a
    - title: secular court is to first bring it to a
    - title: beit din
    - title: and for the
    - title: beit din
    - title: to order its removal to a secular
    - title: court.
    - title: Now since a
    - title: beit din
    - title: is imbued with biblical authority to judge controversies why, one may
        ask,
    - title: is it ever necessary to bring a matter to a secular court?  It is because
        in this Twenty-First
    - title: Century and in most western nations,
    - title: b’nei din
    - title: are not allowed the same jurisdictions and, in the
    - title: case of overlapping jurisdictions, the same powers of enforcement as
        they had in ancient times –
    - title: even during the lifetimes of Yeshua and Sha’ul.  The result is that,
        without recourse to secular
    - title: courts, contesting believers today would not be able to receive justice
        in certain matters, could
    - title: they not find their way to a secular court.
    - title: The principal way that a believer is to initiate resolution of his complaint
        against another believer
    - title: is detailed in
    - title: Matthew 18:15-18
    - title: .  This assumes that the complaint is civil and not criminal, since
    - title: criminal offenses are against secular society at large and not against
        individuals.
    - title: B’nei din
    - title: today
    - title: Jay P. Green, Sr.,
    - title: The Interlinear Bible
    - title: ', ed. 2, 1986.'
    - title: 'Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance translates the Greek word #3750 as “not
        indeed” and “nay, not.”'
    - title: are given no jurisdiction in secular criminal matters, but do have limited
        jurisdiction over matters
    - title: in the communities to which they belong.  The complaining believer is
        to go first to his brother
    - title: alone and, if reconciliation of his complaint is not achieved, he is
        to bring one or two witnesses
    - title: with him and try again.  If that is unsuccessful and he chooses to proceed,
        he asks for a
    - title: beit din
    - title: of believers to be convened to hear his complaint and render judgment.  If
        judgment is rendered
    - title: against the responding brother and the brother does not receive the judgment
        or disobeys orders
    - title: of the
    - title: beit din,
    - title: the community of believers is informed, and the respondent is treated
        as if he
    - title: were an unbeliever.
    - title: Since there is no prohibition against believers suing unbelievers in
        secular courts, this is one way
    - title: that a controversy between believing brothers can end up there.  It is
        the route that should be
    - title: taken when a believer in Yeshua seeks a divorce or separation from his
        or her spouse regardless
    - title: of whether his or her spouse is a believer.  The purpose is to determine,
        by a finding of the
    - title: beit
    - title: din,
    - title: whether or not the divorce sought is on biblically allowed grounds.  Also,
        after a biblical
    - title: divorce (a
    - title: get
    - title: ) is granted, the innocent believing spouse may still need to follow
        up in a secular
    - title: court in order to be able to remarry or to receive enforced child support.
    - title: Another way for a controversy between believers to be rightly adjudicated
        in a secular court is
    - title: for a
    - title: beit din
    - title: to authorize it.  There is sometimes a need for secular intervention
        due to the
    - title: limitation of a
    - title: beit din’s
    - title: jurisdiction or power of enforcement.  An example is when a key
    - title: witness is subpoenaed and refuses to testify.  A
    - title: beit din
    - title: cannot arrest the witness and bring him
    - title: to court, whereas a secular court can.  There are a myriad of other circumstances
        as well in which
    - title: a secular court can act but a
    - title: beit din
    - title: cannot.  One such circumstance is where a
    - title: beit din
    - title: renders
    - title: judgment against a respondent for a sum of money, and the respondent
        ignores the judgment.
    - title: The
    - title: beit din
    - title: cannot attach the respondent’s property to satisfy the judgment, whereas
        a secular
    - title: court can.
    - title: 1 Corinthians 6:7
    - title: 'says: “'
    - title: Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?”
    - title: This applies if retribution is all that is being sought, but it is different
        if justice is at stake, or
    - title: satisfying a money judgment is needed for a complainant’s survival.

    - title: referred to throughout the
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: in regard to priestly service and serving God, but as to serving
    - title: our fellow man it is typically “servitude” – the kind of servanthood
        that is subordinate to a
    - title: master.  Slavery is spoken of in both Testaments as well, as is also
        indentured servanthood, a
    - title: kind of “slavery for a season.”   By contrast,
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: urging servanthood are so important in the
    - title: New Testament, that Yeshua and God Himself are portrayed as being servants
        to mankind.

    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: comes before the others,
    - title: however, because one must be sensitive to recognize another’s need before
        one can even
    - title: consider helping. There are, however, some needs that do not require
        much or any sensitivity
    - title: because we are commanded to be proactive in providing for them.  One
        such example is
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: '#BB7: “Supporting Our Family Financially.”  One does not need much sensitivity
        to observe that'
    - title: our family is unfed, unclothed, or unsheltered.  On the other hand, a

    - title: Being sensitive to another’s needs is inextricably related to
    - title: Mitzvah

    - title: Compassion” because our sensitivity does no good if our compassion (derived

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: The meaning in Scripture of not being strong is not referring to muscular
        strength.  It is referring
    - title: to lack of spiritual strength – weakness of faith that results in sin
        and personal unfulfillment.
    - title: One can also argue that
    - title: Romans 15:1
    - title: applies to widows, orphans, and others who are not strong
    - title: due to a handicap, disability, or circumstance.  Supporting widows and
        orphans is the subject of

    - title: This

    - title: '#DA11 instructs us to bear (i.e., carry – not bear with or condone)
        the weaknesses'

    - title: upon ourselves the weight (the responsibility) of ministering comfort,
        godly direction, and
    - title: sometimes physical helps and provisions to such people provided, of course.
        they are willing to
    - title: receive it.  It is a weight on us because it is easier to avoid such
        people and their problems, and
    - title: yet we are called to “love your neighbor as yourself” (
    - title: Matthew 22:39
    - title: ); in doing so, however, we

        the Holy Spirit

    - title: Being good to one another is similar to being kind to one another.  Being
        good, being kind, being
    - title: generous, and being nice, are not always the same.  Is it being good
        and kind to give our
    - title: neighbor money to support his alcoholic addiction?  Our neighbor may
        think so, but by God’s
    - title: standards it is not, and it is not the kind of generosity that God desires
        of us!  Other decisions we
    - title: may have to make as to what is appropriate generosity and what is good
        or kind and what is not
    - title: may not be this obvious, so we need to rely on the Holy Spirit to guide

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: “Submitting to one another” means subordinating our desires (and sometimes
        even our welfare)
    - title: to the needs and welfare of another; it is a term that means putting
        another before our self.
    - title: Submitting to God and Messiah must be total and unconditional, but our
        submitting to one
    - title: another per this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: has its biblical and godly limits.  Do we comply with the demand of
    - title: another that we procure something for him illegally?  Of course not.  Do
        we risk our life to save
    - title: the life of another?  Sometimes yes and sometimes no.  Each situation
        in which we are called to
    - title: give something of ourselves for another calls for wisdom that can only
        reliably be acquired from
    - title: the Holy Spirit.
    - title: The examples I gave are extreme; more often we are called to submit to
        others with our love, our
    - title: compassion, our time, our money, and sometimes our property – sacrificial,
        nevertheless.  There
    - title: are no criteria for deciding whether to, or how much to, but
    - title: Ephesians 5:21
    - title: in the CJB says that
    - title: we are to submit to one another “in fear of the Messiah” (the NKJ version
        says “in the fear of
    - title: God”).  The word “fear,” as used here, means in compliance with God’s
        will – hence the need
    - title: for us to pray to God and be directed by the Holy Spirit.

    commandments_related_ot: []
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: The very existence of Scriptures that implore us to be likeminded and
        in unity suggests that at
    - title: the time they were written the body of believers was not.  That was then,
        and now is now, and
    - title: nothing much has changed; we still are not.  Being in unity requires
        first being likeminded, and
    - title: being likeminded can only occur when we ascribe to the same laws and
        principles of conduct; for
    - title: we who are believers in Yeshua, the laws and principles must be the Word

    - title: We live in a predominantly secular society under secular governments.  When
        believers, acting

        Scripture in the same
    - title: correct way, we are a godly witness and are able to influence society
        in a godly direction. When
    - title: we are not likeminded and not in unity, we play into the hands of the
        adversary, weaken God’s
    - title: influence, and strengthen that of the adversary.

    - title: 'is a sub-commandment of #DA74 that we not associate with a supposed
        brother'
    - title: believer who is committing immoral sin (
    - title: 1 Corinthians 5:11)
    - title: .  Not associating (i.e., not
    - title: fellowshipping) with people who call themselves believers while continuing
        to engage in serious
    - title: (especially moral) sins is sometimes referred to as “shunning.”  There
        are three reasons for
    - title: 'shunning such people: (1) continuing our association with them encourages
        a continuation of'
    - title: their sinful behavior; (2) continuing our association with them reflects
        badly on the body of

    - title: applies to people calling themselves believers – not to unbelievers.  If

        to put restrictions on

    - title: to sin ourselves.  (2) This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: assumes that a supposed believer from whom we are
    - title: disassociating is not repentant and is continuing to sin; we must be
        prepared and willing to

      title: Coveting or Planning to Acquire Another’s Property
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Envy, jealousy, and covetousness are in some ways the same and in some
        ways different.  All
    - title: three are the result of dissatisfaction, are triggered by comparing ourselves
        with others, and are
    - title: desirous of things that others have that we do not.  Typical of such
        things are physical
    - title: appearance, status, wealth, possessions, abilities, relationships, privileges,
        one’s spouse, and
    - title: many others.  The way in which envy and jealousy are different is the
        “loudness” with which
    - title: they are expressed.  Envy is more of a quiet discontentment that begrudgingly
        craves something
    - title: possessed by another, whereas jealousy fears or resents losing something
        to another that we
    - title: believe belongs to us.  Covetousness is jealousy carried a step further.  It
        is contemplating
    - title: owning or taking possession of something that belongs to another and
        resenting the person who
    - title: possesses what we want.
    - title: The wrongfulness of taking (or even thinking of taking) something that
        belongs to another is
    - title: intuitive and a violation of
    - title: Torah
    - title: but why, we may ask, does Scripture command us against
    - title: envy, jealousy, and covetousness even when we do not bring harm to another?  It
        is because we
    - title: are to believe with conviction that God has given us that which He wants
        us to have, and we are
    - title: therefore to be content with what we have.  The Apostle Sha’ul is clear
        about it in
    - title: Philippians
    - title: '4:11'
    - title: 'where he wrote: “Not that I am saying this to call attention to any
        need of mine; since, as far'
    - title: as I am concerned, I have learned to be content regardless of circumstances.”  And
        in
    - title: Hebrews
    - title: 13:5,
    - title: 'he also wrote: “Keep your lives free from the love of money; and be
        satisfied with what'
    - title: you have; for God himself has said, "I will never fail you or abandon
        you."  Dissatisfaction that
    - title: results in envy or jealousy is therefore dissatisfaction with God who
        is the giver of what we have,
    - title: which is, of course, wrong and a sin.

    - title: The King James Version of the Bible translates
    - title: Exodus 20:13(13)
    - title: and
    - title: Deuteronomy 5:17(17)
    - title: as
    - title: “Thou shalt not kill.  However, the Hebrew words
    - title: ָָּּ֥֥
    - title: ָּ֥ל   ֹ֖֥אָּ֥תִּ רְ צ ָֽ ח
    - title: are more properly translated “not
    - title: murder.”  The distinction is important because there are reasons for
        killing human beings that do
    - title: not constitute murder; examples are killing in war, killing by accident,
        killing in self-defense,
    - title: and killing pursuant to legal process.  It is a matter of current debate
        as to whether mercy killings
    - title: and aborting unborn children should be considered murder.
    - title: It is interesting that
    - title: Matthew 5:21-22
    - title: associates murder with nursing anger and demeaning a
    - title: brother contemptuously.  Perhaps it is because both of these actions
        imply improperly removing

    - title: untrue.  Slander” that is knowingly spoken in a court of law is called
        “perjury,” and is itself
    - title: unlawful.  I say “knowingly,” because slanderous testimony given in error
        is not considered
    - title: “perjury.”
    - title: A word used in contemporary law but not used in Bible translations is
        “libel.”  “Libel” is
    - title: distinguished from “slander” in today’s jurisprudence in that “slander”
        is derogatory and untrue
    - title: information about a person that is spoken, whereas “libel” is information
        of the same character
    - title: that is written or otherwise conveyed in a form that has greater permanence
        and is therefore
    - title: considered more damaging.  “Libel” and “slander” are both “defamation”
        because both
    - title: “unjustly” harm a person’s reputation.
    - title: “

    - title: lashon hara
    - title: ” is the spoken or written conveyance of derogatory information
    - title: about a person regardless of whether the information is defamatory (i.e.
        true or untrue) and
    - title: whether malevolent or innocent.  “Gossip” is similar, except the information
        conveyed need not
    - title: be derogatory.
    - title: All of this is to say that we are not to defame or give false testimony
        against our neighbor

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: The New Testament Greek word for “love” as it applies to this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: (e.g. in
    - title: Matthew 22:39
    - title: )
    - title: is ἀγαπήσε”  (“
    - title: agape
    - title: ”).  Unlike the English word “love” in today’s vernacular, “
    - title: agape
    - title: ” does not
    - title: imply emotion or feeling; rather it implies a sacrificial responsibility
        to do for another that which

    - title: ָּ֥  וְ א ָֽ הַ בְ ת
    - title: (

        that is not connected to
    - title: receiving something of value in return may be wrong and unkind, but it

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: Intimidation is the act of doing or saying something (e.g. through threats)
        that causes someone to
    - title: become weak with fear.  We glean from
    - title: Luke 3:14,
    - title: where Yeshua instructed soldiers to not
    - title: intimidate anyone, that intimidation of innocent and defenseless people
        is wrong.  “Innocent and
    - title: defenseless” is not stated in the Scripture, but it is assumed since
        the principal duty of a soldier is
    - title: to fight against an enemy and hopefully make him afraid so he will surrender.  In
    - title: 2 Corinthians 10:1-2,
    - title: Paul is reluctant to intimidate those to whom he is about to bring
    - title: correction, and
    - title: 2 Timothy 1:7
    - title: tells us that God has not given us a spirit of timidity (fear).  It is
    - title: therefore fair to conclude that we are instructed not to intimidate our
        neighbor unnecessarily.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: A term often associated with “giving support” is “enabling,” because
        when one gives support to
    - title: the actions of another, it allows him (or makes it easier for him) to
        continue doing what he is
    - title: doing or allows him to avoid consequences for what he has done.  A person
        who gives support to
    - title: a wrongdoer is often seen as an accomplice and held accountable for the
        wrongful act as if he,
    - title: himself, had committed it.  Also, enabling the actions of a wrongdoer
        can be overt (e.g., acting as
    - title: a lookout in a burglary) or subtle such as giving sanctuary to a person
        known to have committed
    - title: a crime.
    - title: Such was the famous (albeit controversial) case of Dr. Samuel Mudd who
        gave medical

        President Abraham

    - title: and other Scriptures command us to
    - title: “love your
    - title: neighbor as ourself,”
    - title: i.e. everyone.  But this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: speaks only of our not hating our brother,
    - title: so who then is our brother?
    - title: Mark 3:35
    - title: 'says:'

        outsiders; for in so
    - title: doing, some people, without knowing it, have entertained angels.”
    - title: Also,
    - title: 1 John 3:1
    - title: 'says:'
    - title: “See what love the Father has lavished on us in letting us be called
        God's children! For that
    - title: is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it has
        not known him.”
    - title: The inference of these Scriptures is that our brother is only he (or

    - title: On the other hand,
    - title: Proverbs 14:21

    - title: FORGIVENESS IN JEWISH TRADITION
    - title: While there is no explicit commandment in the
    - title: Torah
    - title: requiring that we forgive our brother, there
    - title: is one Scripture,
    - title: Leviticus 19:17
    - title: ', that implicitly means the same thing:'
    - title: '"Do not hate your brother in your heart, but rebuke your neighbor frankly,
        so that you won''t'
    - title: carry sin because of him.  Don't take vengeance on or bear a grudge against
        any of your
    - title: people; rather, love your neighbor as yourself; I am ADONAI."
    - title: Rabbinical literature endorses the principle of forgiving others and
        gives
    - title: Genesis 50:16-21
    - title: (Yosef's forgiveness of his brothers) as the example we are to follow.  Beyond
        that, all other
    - title: 'references to forgiveness are rabbinic; they include:'

    - title: It is clear, however, from the New Covenant Scriptures, that there are
        not one, but two kinds of
    - title: forgiveness – personal (which is unconditional) and judicial (which is

    - title: I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in

    - title: '"And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive
        him; so that your'

    - title: Notice that this kind of forgiveness is truly without condition, and
        is to be granted, not only to
    - title: brothers in the Lord, but to anyone who has sinned against us.  It does
        not seek to judge the
    - title: offender, nor does it require that the offender be repentant.  It must
        be given as soon as possible
    - title: after the offense is committed so that bitterness does not take root
        within us and do spiritual
    - title: damage.  This kind of forgiveness is essentially a releasing of the matter
        to God and does not
    - title: retain anger or a desire for personal vengeance (see

    - title: Luke 6:27-32)
    - title: .  Yeshua
    - title: illustrated this kind of forgiveness when, in
    - title: Luke 23:34a,
    - title: he besought his Father in heaven to
    - title: forgive his Roman soldier executioners who were, even at that moment,
        subjecting him to an
    - title: unjust and painful death.
    - title: Our granting personal forgiveness and not harboring bitterness against
        those who have sinned
    - title: against us purges us of unholy attitudes that may have resulted from
        our being victimized, and
    - title: Sometimes termed "unconditional forgiveness."
    - title: In other translations,
    - title: verses 25-26
    - title: .
    - title: opens the way for God to forgive us for our sins as well.  Conversely,
        if we do not grant personal
    - title: forgiveness,
    - title: Mark 11:25,
    - title: '23'
    - title: 'Matthew 6: 14-15'
    - title: ', and'
    - title: Luke 6:37
    - title: convey the certainty that God will
    - title: not forgive us either.  Granting personal forgiveness does not, however,
        mean that the
    - title: relationship or trust between people is restored.  It only means that
        the person who has forgiven
    - title: has freed himself from anger and a desire for vengeance, and that he
        has a heart to see the person
    - title: who has sinned against him repent so that he might be blessed by God.
    - title: JUDICIAL FORGIVENESS
    - title: I call the kind of forgiveness commanded in
    - title: Luke 17:3-4
    - title: '"judicial'
    - title: f
    - title: orgiveness.”
    - title: '24'
    - title: “Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents,
        forgive him.
    - title: Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times
        he comes to you and says,
    - title: '''I repent,'' you are to forgive him.”'
    - title: Judicial forgiveness is different from personal forgiveness in several
        ways that the
    - title: Luke
    - title: Scripture illustrates.  First, judicial forgiveness applies only to brother
        believers.
    - title: '25'
    - title: Second,
    - title: whereas personal forgiveness must be given whether or not there is repentance,
        judicial
    - title: forgiveness is only granted if the offending brother repents.  The brother
        who has been sinned
    - title: against is required to judge whether the offending brother has repented
        before the offended
    - title: brother forgives him.  It is different in another way as well, as illustrated
        in
    - title: 'John 20: 23,'
    - title: which
    - title: 'states:'
    - title: “If you forgive someone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you hold
        them, they are held.”
    - title: Here you see that if the one who is sinned-against judges that his offending
        brother is repentant
    - title: and forgives him, God also forgives the offending brother.  Conversely,
        if the one who is sinned
    - title: against withholds forgiveness because, in his judgment, his offending
        brother is not repentant,
    - title: then God honors the judgment and does not forgive the offending brother
        either.  One may ask
    - title: why
    - title: John 20:23
    - title: applies only as between believers since the Scripture doesn't say that!  It
        is
    - title: because the verse involves judging, and
    - title: 1 Corinthians 5:12-13
    - title: allows us to judge those who are
    - title: believers, but not those who are not.
    - title: FORGIVENESS HAS NO LIMITS
    - title: There is no maximum number of times that we must forgive those who sin
        against us, even if
    - title: they do so repeatedly.  As previously stated in
    - title: 'Luke 17:4:'
    - title: “Also, if seven times in one day he sins against you, and seven times
        he comes to you and
    - title: says, 'I repent,' you are to forgive him.”
    - title: And similarly, in
    - title: Matthew 18:21-22
    - title: ':'
    - title: '23'
    - title: ibid.
    - title: Sometimes referred to as “conditional” or “transactional” forgiveness.
    - title: Understand that everything said about a brother believer applies to a
        sister as well.
    - title: “Then Kefa came up and said to him, ‘Rabbi, how often can my brother
        sin against me and I
    - title: have to forgive him? As many as seven times?’  ‘No, not seven times,"
        answered Yeshua, ‘but
    - title: seventy times seven!’”
    - title: Caveat
    - title: Scripture's requirement that we forgive does not negate our responsibility
        to cooperate with
    - title: public authorities when matters of justice or the protection of others
        is involved.

    - title: Scripture has much to say about prisoners and being imprisoned.
    - title: '26'
    - title: Some of the translations of
    - title: Hebrews 13:3
    - title: (and other Scriptures) can be read as referring only to people in physical
        prisons,
    - title: while others can be read to include people mistreated generally.  It
        is especially so when one
    - title: considers
    - title: 'verses 1 and 2:'
    - title: “Let brotherly friendship continue; but don't forget to be friendly to
        outsiders; for in so
    - title: doing, some people, without knowing it, have entertained angels.”
    - title: In other Scriptures such as
    - title: Isaiah 61:1
    - title: ', imprisonment refers to the spiritual bondage of sin that'
    - title: 'separates us from God:'
    - title: “The Spirit of Adonai ELOHIM is upon me, because ADONAI has anointed
        me to announce
    - title: good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted; to proclaim
        freedom to the
    - title: captives, to let out into light those bound in the dark;”
    - title: Yeshua spoke similarly in
    - title: Luke 4:18-19
    - title: 'after reading from the Scroll of Isaiah:'
    - title: “The Spirit of ADONAI is upon me; therefore he has anointed me to announce
        Good News to
    - title: the poor; he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the imprisoned and renewed
        sight for the
    - title: blind, to release those who have been crushed, to proclaim a year of
        the favor of ADONAI.”
    - title: Not only did Yeshua employ the Good News to free those who were spiritually
        imprisoned, but
    - title: we read in
    - title: Luke 9:1-6
    - title: 'that he sent his disciples out to do the same:'
    - title: “Calling together the Twelve, Yeshua gave them power and authority to
        expel all the demons
    - title: and to cure diseases; and he sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of
        God and to heal.  He
    - title: said to them, "Take nothing for your trip- neither a walking stick nor
        a pack, neither bread
    - title: nor money; and don't have two shirts.  Whatever house you enter, stay
        there and go out from
    - title: there.  Wherever they don't welcome you, shake the dust from your feet
        when you leave that
    - title: Sometimes the word “captive” is used when meaning prisoner.
    - title: town as a warning to them."  They set out and went through village after
        village, healing and
    - title: announcing the Good News everywhere.”
    - title: Considering the application of these Scriptures to
    - title: Hebrews 13:3
    - title: – yes, we are called to minister
    - title: to prisoners in physical prisons, but considering the greater numbers
        of those who are imprisoned
    - title: by their sin and by not knowing God and Yeshua, how much more are we,
        Yeshua’s latter day
    - title: disciples, called to empathize with, and bring the Good News to, those
        who are spiritually
    - title: imprisoned and headed for a sentence of death.

    - title: Vengeance and revenge are not the same.  Vengeance is the infliction
        of
    - title: punishment or
    - title: retribution exacted for the commission of an injury or wrongful act.  Avenging
        (causing
    - title: vengeance) is answering a wrongful act by punishing or requiring retribution
        from a wrongdoer;
    - title: it is sometimes appropriate (and sometimes even required) by both biblical

    - title: Revenge, on the other hand, is the infliction of punishment or retribution
        with an attitude of
    - title: wanting to hurt a person in return for his having hurt us. Revenge is
        always wrong because
    - title: Scripture calls us to love and forgive our neighbor and even our enemies.
        The prohibition of this
    - title: Mitzvah

        take revenge for a

    - title: Hebrews 13:1-2
    - title: distinguishes between having friendships with brothers and being friendly
    - title: (hospitable) to outsiders.  Friendship is covenantal and implies a deeper
        commitment to one
    - title: another than just being friendly.
    - title: Proverbs 18:24
    - title: 'says:'
    - title: “Some ‘friends’ pretend to be friends, but
    - title: a true friend sticks closer than a brother.”
    - title: One can, however, be friendly to a person who is a
    - title: mere acquaintance – not a brother, not a friend, and one who is even
        an enemy.
    - title: In my opinion, the
    - title: Hebrews 13
    - title: requirement that we be friendly to outsiders should be understood
    - title: to mean people outside of faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
    - title: 2 Corinthians 6:14
    - title: 'says:'
    - title: “Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers. For how
        can righteousness
    - title: and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have with darkness?”
    - title: For that reason,
    - title: some would say that the
    - title: Hebrews 13
    - title: Scripture means that we cannot have friendships outside of
    - title: faith in Yeshua and the New Testament.  I am, however, of the opinion
        that, unlike the covenant
    - title: of marriage, the biblical covenant of friendship can be achieved so long
        as both parties believe
    - title: in, and adhere to, the principles taught in the
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: .
    - title: Now, why the emphasis on being friendly to outsiders?  It is because
        we are responsible for
    - title: sharing the Good News of Yeshua to those who do not know him as Messiah
        and, without being
    - title: friendly to outsiders, we cannot minister to people who are outside the
        faith.  As for the reference
    - title: in
    - title: Hebrews 13
    - title: to entertaining angels, I believe it is referring to people who have
        been specially
    - title: blessed to have had an encounter with God.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: There are several ways that we can be indebted to another person – some
        financial and some
    - title: non-financial.  In early days, unpaid debts were generally paid by the
        debtor working off his debt
    - title: as an indentured servant.  A person who owed a debt was not free of his
        work obligation until the
    - title: debt was paid.  In the mid nineteenth century, debtor’s prisons substantially
        replaced the practice
    - title: of indentured servitude in the western world, and today, while there
        are no longer debtor’s
    - title: prisons, owing a debt that one cannot pay nevertheless results in a bondage
        of obligation that
    - title: God does not want us to have.  That is why
    - title: Romans 13:8
    - title: 'instructs us: “Don''t owe anyone'
    - title: anything- except to love one another.”
    - title: In today’s world, buying on credit for personal or business reasons is
        commonplace, which raises
    - title: the question as to whether it is permissible for believers to borrow
        money or acquire property or
    - title: services for which payment is deferred.  The answer is complex because
        of the various kinds of
    - title: loans and circumstances that exist.  In general, I would say that collateralized
        loans are not
    - title: biblically prohibited.  Because the collateral is there to repay the
        loan should the lender not be
    - title: able to repay it, a true debt (ie. an obligation without means of repayment)
        never really exists.  I
    - title: am of the opinion that, except for debt incurred in emergencies and for
        humanitarian reasons,
    - title: unsecured debt with no clear means of repayment is what
    - title: Romans 13:8
    - title: prohibits.  The stated
    - title: exception “to love one another” actually requires that we lend to people
        (especially to brothers)
    - title: who are in need even when there is a risk of the loan not being repaid
        (see “Supportive
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: Scriptures” supra, and “Related
    - title: Mitzvot
    - title: in Volumes 1 & 2” infra).
    - title: Typical of the kind of debt we are not to incur is that which is created
        by the elective use of
    - title: credit cards where the borrower has no immediate means of repayment.  Our
        desire to have
    - title: things that are not necessary and that we cannot afford is what most
        often lures us into financial
    - title: bondage, and is what
    - title: Romans 13:8
    - title: is mostly speaking against.

      title: Being Compassionate & Merciful Toward Our Neighbor
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: There are many Scriptures telling us that God is the source of our comfort,
    - title: 2 Corinthians 1:3-4
    - title: 'being one of them:'
    - title: “Praised be God, Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, compassionate
        Father, God of all
    - title: encouragement and comfort; who encourages us in all our trials, so that
        we can encourage
    - title: others in whatever trials they may be undergoing with the encouragement
        we ourselves have
    - title: received from God.”
    - title: Why, therefore, are there Scriptures that require that we comfort one
        another?  It is because we
    - title: are created in God’s image and are therefore to love our neighbor as
        God loves us and taught us
    - title: how (
    - title: 1 John 4:19)
    - title: .  We live in a fallen world and are therefore subject to pain, anguish,
    - title: disappointment, broken-heartedness, grief, and more.  God wants us to
        overcome in the face of
    - title: these, and He uses our comfort of each other as one of the ways that
        He empowers us to do so.
    - title: The key Scripture supporting this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: speaks to counselors, but since comforting by sharing
    - title: God’s word is the responsibility of all believers, the authors herein
        consider that
    - title: Romans 12:8
    - title: is
    - title: applicable to us all.
    - title: Caveat
    - title: One must be careful not to comfort another in a manner that endorses
        or enables the continuation
    - title: of sinful behavior.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: ', to not deceive our neighbor, is an obvious extension of the'
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: to love our
    - title: neighbor.  There are, nevertheless, exceptions; they are when deception
        is allowed or even used
    - title: by God to achieve godly ends such as saving a life, testing us, or avoiding
        injustice.
    - title: One such case is in
    - title: Genesis 20:2
    - title: where, in order to protect his wife Sarah, Abraham lied to
    - title: Avimelekh, telling him that Sarah was his sister.  Another case is
    - title: Joshua 2:1
    - title: (and verses
    - title: following), where Y’hoshua son of Num secretly sent spies to inspect
        land in the vicinity of (and
    - title: including)
    - title: Yericho
    - title: in order to determine if it was safe for the Israelites to go there.  A
        third case
    - title: is in
    - title: 1 Samuel 19:13-17
    - title: where, in order to prevent Saul from killing David, Michal told Saul
        that
    - title: David was sick, whereas the truth was that David had escaped and was
        fleeing.
    - title: God warns us against spiritual deception, but He sometimes allows it
        in order to test us.  Such
    - title: was the case where God allowed Satan to tempt and deceive Eve, and Eve
        did likewise to Adam.
    - title: They failed the test, and we are paying for it.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: One might ask how this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: “bear one another’s burdens” squares with
    - title: 'Galatians 6:5:'
    - title: “.. for
    - title: each person will carry his own load.
    - title: ”  The answer is that the words translated “
    - title: burdens
    - title: ” in
    - title: Galatians 6:2
    - title: and “
    - title: load
    - title: ” in
    - title: Galatians 6:5
    - title: are different Greek words.  The Greek word “
    - title: bare
    - title: ” in
    - title: Galatians 6:2
    - title: is something extremely heavy and burdensome, whereas the word “
    - title: phortion
    - title: ” in
    - title: Galatians 6:5
    - title: is a soldier’s pack of the kind that one person should be able to carry
        easily.
    - title: Conceivably, the burdens referred to in this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: could apply to things physically heavy, but
    - title: that is not its main intent.  Its intent is for us to assist our fellow
        man as he encounters the various
    - title: burdens of life.  The New Testament Scriptures listed above illustrate
        this by exhorting us to be
    - title: kind to one another, pray for one another, correct one another, serve
        each other’s needs, etc.
    - title: Yeshua illustrated this in
    - title: Luke 11:46
    - title: 'where he chastised the experts in law:'
    - title: '"'
    - title: Woe to you Torah
    - title: experts too! You load people down with burdens they can hardly bear,
        and you won't lift a finger
    - title: to help them!
    - title: ”  In our attempting to comply with this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: ', we must remember that we cannot'
    - title: do it alone and must rely on God.
    - title: Matthew 11:29-30
    - title: 'puts it this way:'
    - title: “
    - title: Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble
        in heart, and
    - title: you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy, and my burden

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: In the
    - title: Tanakh
    - title: ', outsiders (also referred to as strangers or foreigners) were not merely
        Gentiles;'
    - title: they were Gentiles who lived outside the community of Israel.  Gentiles
        who lived within the
    - title: Community may have been
    - title: gerim toshav
    - title: (resident aliens or Tikkun’s terminology
    - title: K’rovei
    - title: Yisrael
    - title: ).  They were not considered outsiders, and could even partake of the
        Passover sacrifice if
    - title: they were circumcised
    - title: (Exodus 12:43-49
    - title: ).
    - title: Under the Mosaic Covenant, outsiders had to be treated with love and
        respect, but Israelites did
    - title: not have the same brotherly obligation of providing for their needs as
        they did for other
    - title: Israelites, and could even lend to them at interest.  Under the New Covenant,
        Gentile believers in
    - title: Yeshua are grafted into the olive tree of Israel (
    - title: Romans 11:16-1
    - title: 7) and are therefore brothers in
    - title: the faith with Jewish believers; they are not considered outsiders even
        if they do not reside
    - title: within a Jewish Community.
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: and
    - title: 'Colossians 4:'
    - title: 5-6 instruct believers in Yeshua to act wisely in their contacts and
    - title: conversations with outsiders (unbelievers) in order to make “full use
        of every opportunity.”  The
    - title: Scripture does not say to what opportunities it is referring, but we
        assume from the context that
    - title: they are opportunities to share both God and Yeshua with unbelievers.  The
        Scripture also does
    - title: not indicate to what wise acts it is referring other than conversations,
        and rightfully so, because
    - title: each encounter with an unbeliever presents its own challenges.  Naturally,
        we must act civilly
    - title: and lovingly, but we must also seek the Holy Spirit so that the Spirit’s
        wisdom becomes our
    - title: wisdom.

    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: 'From Volumes 1 and 2:'
    - title: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” is the well-known
        “golden rule,” but it
    - title: does not appear in the Bible in that form.  What is in the Bible is
    - title: Mark 12:30-31
    - title: ', which states:'
    - title: “.. and you are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart, with all
        your soul, with all
    - title: 'your understanding and with all your strength.''  The second is this:
        ''You are to love your'
    - title: neighbor as yourself.' There is no other mitzvah greater than these.”
    - title: Applying that principle, Scripture teaches that we have a duty to help
        others, even to try to save
    - title: the life of a person who is attacked.  What is unclear is whether the
        duty applies even if it puts
    - title: the protector in danger and, because Scripture is silent on the matter,
        I will not speculate.
    - title: The parable of the “good Samaritan” is the classic Scripture that lauds
        assisting a person who has
    - title: been attacked, but it is noteworthy that at no time was the “good Samaritan”
        in danger since he
    - title: gave his help after the attack on the injured man had occurred.  Nevertheless,
        he helped the
    - title: stranger in need by spending his own time and money.
    - title: Interestingly, some U.S. States have adopted what they call the “Good
        Samaritan Law” which
    - title: does not require that a bystander help a person who is in distress, but
        states that if he does and
    - title: causes injury in the process, he cannot be sued for his attempt.

    - title: There are different ways of treating people with respect according to

    - title: older or younger or male or female.  Men do not treat women as they do
        other men, nor do

    commandments_related_ot: []
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: On its surface, this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: “Not Showing Favoritism” seems intuitive but can, on occasion, be
    - title: misunderstood.  First, favoritism applies to people –not to favorite
        foods, possessions,
    - title: experiences, etc.  Second, favoritism implies partiality that is improper
        such as promoting a less
    - title: qualified person over one who is more highly qualified, in order to acquire
        some personal gain.
    - title: When we favor one person over another for right reasons. we do not call
        it favoritism.  If I, as a
    - title: supervisor, favor one of my staff over another for a task for which he
        is especially well suited,
    - title: that is good management – not favoritism.  If I choose to spend more
        time with my son than with
    - title: an unrelated person, that is good fathering – not favoritism.  On the
        other hand, if I appoint my
    - title: son to a position over a better qualified person merely because he is
        my son, that is showing
    - title: favoritism.  On the other hand (I think I have run out of hands), if
        the position is in a family-
    - title: owned business in which everyone’s expectation is that my son is the
        heir apparent, then
    - title: favoritism in my son’s behalf is both expected and appropriate, and this
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: would not
    - title: apply.

      title: Wronging One Another through Our Speech
    commentary_rudolph:
    - title: This
    - title: Mitzvah
    - title: is referred to in Jewish literature as “
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: ” – evil speech.  Slander is a form
    - title: of
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: but differs from it (at least in contemporary usage) in that
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: is any
    - title: pejorative speech about someone (true or not) whereas slander is pejorative
        speech that is
    - title: untrue.
    - title: '28'
    - title: Gossip is
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: only if the information being spread is negative.
    - title: The above-referenced Scriptures have to do with the speaking of
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: ', but what about'
    - title: giving a willing ear to it?  I suggest that listening to
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: is also sinful – not with the
    - title: tongue but with the ear – and perhaps is even more sinful than speaking
        it because the one who
    - title: willfully listens to
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: becomes an enabler and a contributor to the sin of the one who
    - title: speaks it.  Here are two Scriptures that clearly show God’s attitude
        toward those who listen to the
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: 'of gossip:'
    - title: Proverbs 16:27
    - title: A worthless person digs up evil [gossip] – it is like scorching fire
        on his lips.
    - title: Proverbs 20:19
    - title: A gossip goes around revealing secrets, so don't get involved with a
        talkative person.
    - title: There are at least four exceptions to
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: .  First, speaking negatively about a person is
    - title: permitted when it is intended for the person’s good and is accompanied
        by godly wisdom and
    - title: discretion.  Miryam’s offense of murmuring against Moses in
    - title: Numbers 12:1-10
    - title: was that she did
    - title: not intend what she said to be for Moses’ good.  Had she said instead
        ..
    - title: “Aaron, I am worried about Moses because I think that marrying the Ethiopian
        woman was
    - title: the wrong thing for him to do.”
    - title: In the Hebrew Scriptures, “slander” is
    - title: “rakiyl,”
    - title: and in the Greek Scriptures it is
    - title: “blasphemeo.”
    - title: Translators use
    - title: other English words for these as well (e.g. “talebearing”).
    - title: her comment, while still critical of Moses, would have been intended
        for Moses’ good, and I do
    - title: not believe she would not have been punished for what she said.
    - title: The second exception to
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: is when our negative words about a person are meant for
    - title: justice.  A situation in which this occurs is when we give testimony
        against a person in a
    - title: beit din
    - title: or a secular court of law.
    - title: Deuteronomy 19:15
    - title: 'anticipates this through its instruction:'
    - title: “One witness alone will not be sufficient to convict a person of any
        offense or sin of any
    - title: kind; the matter will be established only if there are two or three witnesses
        testifying against
    - title: him.”
    - title: The third exception to
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: is when our negative words about a person are in response to
    - title: our having a special responsibility to speak.  An example would be reporting
        a crime or the
    - title: abuse of a child, or a juror deliberating with other jurors.  Sha’ul
        himself made statements that
    - title: would be considered
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: had he not been imbued with special apostolic responsibility
    - title: for the congregations he was overseeing; consider, for example, his comments
        about his fellow
    - title: shaliach
    - title: 'Kefa:'
    - title: Galatians 2:11-13
    - title: Furthermore, when Kefa came to Antioch, I opposed him publicly, because
        he was clearly in
    - title: the wrong.  For prior to the arrival of certain people from [the community
        headed by]
    - title: Ya'akov, he had been eating with the Gentile believers; but when they
        came, he withdrew and
    - title: separated himself, because he was afraid of the faction who favored circumcising
        Gentile
    - title: believers.  And the other Jewish believers became hypocrites along with
        him, so that even
    - title: Bar-Nabba was led astray by their hypocrisy.”
    - title: Also, Sha’ul “names names” in
    - title: '1 Timothy 1:19b-20:'
    - title: “By rejecting conscience, some have made shipwreck of their trust; among
        them are
    - title: Hymenaeus and Alexander. I have turned them over to the Adversary, so
        that they will learn
    - title: not to insult God.”
    - title: The fourth exception to
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: is when a person who is privy to pejorative information
    - title: about a person legitimately needs counsel as to what to do with the information
        or how to
    - title: respond to it.  Husbands and wives are not prohibited from confiding
        in each other, but
    - title: sometimes it is best to seek advice from a counselor, or a pastor or
        mature believer who has no
    - title: prior knowledge of the parties involved.
    - title: All speech (both complementary and critical) has spiritual power and
        can be used for both good
    - title: and bad.  It can bring comfort and it can distress; it can bring blessing
        and it can harm.  As
    - title: believers, our witness of Yeshua to those who do not know him requires
        that we be different than
    - title: unbelievers, and one of the most noticeable ways of our being different
        is how we speak and how
    - title: we respond to others who speak.  Ridding ourselves of
    - title: lashon hara
    - title: is not an option – it is a
    - title: commandment that we must take seriously.
