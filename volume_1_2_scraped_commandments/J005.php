<i>Here is a statement you can trust: anyone aspiring to be a congregation
leader is seeking worthwhile work. A congregation leader must be above
reproach, he must be faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled,
orderly, hospitable and able to teach. He must not drink excessively or get
into fights; rather, he must be kind and gentle. He must not be a lover of
money. He must manage his own household well, having children who obey him
with all proper respect; for if a man can&#039;t manage his own household,
how will he be able to care for God&#039;s Messianic Community? He must not
be a new believer, because he might become puffed up with pride and thus
fall under the same judgment as did the Adversary. Furthermore, he must be
well regarded by outsiders, so that he won&#039;t fall into disgrace and
into the Adversary&#039;s trap.</i>

<i>For an overseer, as someone entrusted with God&#039;s affairs, must be
blameless - he must not be self-willed or quick-tempered, he must not drink
excessively, get into fights or be greedy for dishonest gain. On the
contrary, he must be hospitable, devoted to good, sober-mindedness,
uprightness, holiness and self-control. He must hold firmly to the
trustworthy Message that agrees with the doctrine; so that by his sound
teaching he will be able to exhort and encourage, and also to refute those
who speak against it. For there are many, especially from the Circumcision
faction, who are rebellious, who delude people&#039;s minds with their
worthless and misleading talk. They must be silenced; because they are
upsetting entire households by teaching what they have no business teaching,
and doing it for the sake of dishonest gain. Even one of the Cretans&#039;

<i>The following day Moshe sat to settle disputes for the people, while the
people stood around Moshe from morning till evening. When Moshe&#039;s
father-in-law saw all that he was doing to the people, he said, "What is
this that you are doing to the people? Why do you sit there alone, with all
the people standing around you from morning till evening?" Moshe answered
his father-in-law, "It&#039;s because the people come to me seeking
God&#039;s guidance. Whenever they have a dispute, it comes to me; I judge
between one person and another, and I explain to them God&#039;s laws and
teachings." Moshe&#039;s father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing
isn&#039;t good. You will certainly wear yourself out- and not only
yourself, but these people here with you as well. It&#039;s too much for
you - you can&#039;t do it alone, by yourself. So listen now to what I have
to say. I will give you some advice, and God will be with you. You should
represent the people before God, and you should bring their cases to God.
You should also teach them the laws and the teachings, and show them how to
live their lives and what work they should do. But you should choose from
among all the people competent men who are God-fearing, honest and
incorruptible to be their leaders, in charge of thousands, hundreds, fifties
and tens. Normally, they will settle the people&#039;s disputes. They
should bring you the difficult cases; but ordinary matters they should
decide themselves. In this way, they will make it easier for you and share
the load with you. If you do this - and God is directing you to do it - you
will be able to endure; and all these people too will arrive at their
destination peacefully." Moshe paid attention to his father-in-law&#039;s
counsel and did everything he said. Moshe chose competent men from all
Isra&#039;el and made them heads over the people, in charge of thousands,
hundreds, fifties and tens. As a general rule, they settled the
people&#039;s disputes - the difficult cases they brought to Moshe, but
every simple matter they decided themselves.</i>

<i>But some men came down from Y&#039;hudah to Antioch and began teaching the
brothers, "You can&#039;t be saved unless you undergo b&#039;rit-milah in
the manner prescribed by Moshe." This brought them into no small measure of
discord and dispute with Sha&#039;ul and Bar-Nabba. So the congregation
assigned Sha&#039;ul, Bar-Nabba and some of themselves to go and put this
sh&#039;eilah before the emissaries and the elders up in Yerushalayim. After
being sent off by the congregation, they made their way through Phoenicia
and Shomron, recounting in detail how the Gentiles had turned to God; and
this news brought great joy to all the brothers. On arrival in
Yerushalayim, they were welcomed by the Messianic community, including the
emissaries and the elders; and they reported what God had done through them.
But some of those who had come to trust were from the party of the
P&#039;rushim; and they stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise
them and direct them to observe the Torah of Moshe." The emissaries and the
elders met to look into this matter. After lengthy debate, Kefa got up and
said to them, "Brothers, you yourselves know that a good while back, God
chose me from among you to be the one by whose mouth the Goyim should hear
the message of the Good News and come to trust. And God, who knows the
heart, bore them witness by giving the Ruach HaKodesh to them, just as he
did to us; that is, he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed
their heart by trust. So why are you putting God to the test now by placing
a yoke on the neck of the talmidim which neither our fathers nor we have had
the strength to bear? No, it is through the love and kindness of the Lord
Yeshua that we trust and are delivered - and it&#039;s the same with them."
Then the whole assembly kept still as they listened to Bar-Nabba and
Sha&#039;ul tell what signs and miracles God had done through them among the
Gentiles. Ya&#039;akov broke the silence to reply. "Brothers," he said,
"hear what I have to say. Shim&#039;on has told in detail what God did when
he first began to show his concern for taking from among the Goyim a people
to bear his name. And the words of the Prophets are in complete harmony
with this for it is written, &#039;"After this, I will return; and I will
rebuild the fallen tent of David. I will rebuild its ruins, I will restore
it, so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, that is, all the Goyim
who have been called by my name," says ADONAI, who is doing these
things.&#039; All this has been known for ages. Therefore, my opinion is
that we should not put obstacles in the way of the Goyim who are turning to
God. Instead, we should write them a letter telling them to abstain from
things polluted by idols, from fornication, from what is strangled and from
blood. For from the earliest times, Moshe has had in every city those who
proclaim him, with his words being read in the synagogues every Shabbat."
Then the emissaries and the elders, together with the whole Messianic
community, decided to select men from among themselves to send to Antioch
with Sha&#039;ul and Bar-Nabba. They sent Y&#039;hudah, called Bar-Sabba,
and Sila, both leading men among the brothers, with the following letter:
From: The emissaries and the elders, your brothers To: The brothers from
among the Gentiles throughout Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings! We have
heard that some people went out from among us without our authorization, and
that they have upset you with their talk, unsettling your minds. So we have
decided unanimously to select men and send them to you with our dear friends
Bar-Nabba and Sha&#039;ul, who have dedicated their lives to upholding the
name of our Lord, Yeshua the Messiah. So we have sent Y&#039;hudah and
Sila, and they will confirm in person what we are writing. For it seemed
good to the Ruach HaKodesh and to us not to lay any heavier burden on you
than the following requirements: to abstain from what has been sacrificed to
idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. If you keep
yourselves from these, you will be doing the right thing. Shalom! The
messengers were sent off and went to Antioch, where they gathered the group
together and delivered the letter. After reading it, the people were
delighted by its encouragement.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> presents Scriptures supporting the statement: "We are to
appoint elders in our communities to lead, pray, judge, teach, & make
<i>halachah</i>." The Scriptures on appointing, leading, praying, and
teaching are self-explanatory, so this commentary is limited to discussing
the role of elders making <i>halachah</i>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Halachot</i> are rules that have the force of law in a Jewish community.
Elders of a Messianic Jewish congregational (or network of congregations)
community can declare <i>halachah</i> (law) for their congregation or network
if their community acknowledges that they have been given the authority to do
so by Scripture. Examples of common <i>halachic</i> rules for congregations
are (a) membership in the congregation requires tithing; (b) membership in
the congregation requires attendance at services; (c) pork products are not
allowed to be served at congregational meals; and (d) men that assist in a
<i>Shabbat Torah</i> service must wear a <i>tallit gadol</i>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
During the Mosaic era, elders were appointed to sit at the gates of the
Israelites' cities and judge cases that were brought to them (e.g.
<u>Deuteronomy 21:18-21</u>; <u>Ruth 4:1-2</u>). With one exception, the
cases decided by elders that we read about in the Bible are those in which a
person lodges a complaint against another person. The exception, the one in
which <i>halachah</i> is made, is <u>Acts 15:1-31</u>. In that Scripture,
elders and apostles gathered in Jerusalem to consider and rule upon how much
of <i>Torah</i> (Mosaic Law) is required of the Gentiles.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is an inescapable necessity that elders of a community interpret God's Law
(both Mosaic and New Covenant) for their respective communities, and make
decisions as to the Law's application. If they do not, the practices of
individuals and families within each community will be out of step with one
another, confusion will result, and the community will not be able to
function. Here is a Scripture from the Mosaic era that will illustrate my
point; it is the familiar commandment to keep the Shabbat:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 20:8-10</u>:
<br>
<i>Remember the day, Shabbat, to set it apart for God. You have six days to
labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Shabbat for ADONAI your
God. On it, you are not to do any kind of work - not you, your son or your
daughter, not your male or female slave, not your livestock, and not the
foreigner staying with you inside the gates to your property.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
But, what constitutes work? Continuing in one's income-producing occupation
is obviously the kind of work that is prohibited by the Scripture, but what
about an elderly or disabled person walking three miles to a synagogue? That
is obviously hard work for them, so is it allowed? If the elders of the
synagogue community determine that it is, or is not, and make their ruling a
standard for that community, they are making <i>halachah</i>, and such
decisions are absolutely necessary for a community of individuals to be able
to function together.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are hundreds if not thousands of such examples, but I will present just
one more for clarity; referring to the Feast of Unleavened bread, we read:

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 12:15</u>

But what does it mean to eat <i>matzah</i> for seven days? Does it mean to
eat it every day for seven days, or does it only mean to not eat leavened
bread for seven days? And what constitutes <i>chametz</i>? Clearly, bread
risen with yeast is <i>chametz</i>, but is it also other foods that have
yeast in them? And if we let a piece of <i>matzah</i> be exposed to the air
long enough for yeast spores from the air to fall on it, does the
<i>matzah</i> become <i>chametz</i> and therefore unacceptable to be eaten
during <i>Pesach</i> and the week following? These are the kinds of decisions
that are best made by the Jewish community in which we live, and when the
elders of our community declare the answers to these and similar questions,
they are making <i>halachah</i> for their community.

The concept of <i>halachah</i> is not the same in the Messianic Jewish
community as in the wider Jewish community. In the wider Jewish community,
<i>halachah</i> is inextricably connected to certain ancient rabbis whose
rulings on Mosaic Law (both written and oral) are recorded in the
<i>Talmud</i>. <i>Responsa</i> are modern (and not-so-modern) era decisions
and rulings made by respected Jewish scholars in response to questions of
Jewish law put to them - also involving the written and (what they consider)
oral Mosaic law. Messianic Jewish <i>halachah</i>, however, is fundamentally
different in that it does not acknowledge an oral <i>Torah</i>, and looks to
the Scriptures (Old and New Testaments) as the only divine authority. It
does, from time to time, consider teachings in the <i>Talmud</i> - not for
their authority, but for information about what is considered to be Jewish in
the wider Jewish community, and occasionally for interpretive wisdom and
cultural application.

There is another way in which Messianic and "wider-Jewish-world"
<i>halachah</i> are different, and that is that Messianic Judaism seeks God's
interpretation of His Law, whereas Orthodox Judaism believes that it has the
authority to interpret it themselves and even change God's <i>Torah</i>; the
origin of this belief can be found in <i><u>TB Bava Metziah 59b</u></i>, in
which one translation

It has been taught: On that day R. Eliezer brought forward every imaginable
argument, but they did not accept them. Said he to them: 'If the
<i>halachah</i> agrees with me, let this carob-tree prove it!' Thereupon the
carob-tree was torn a hundred cubits out of its place - others affirm, four
hundred cubits. 'No proof can be brought from a carob-tree,' they retorted.
Again he said to them: 'If the <i>halachah</i> agrees with me, let the stream
of water prove it!' Whereupon the stream of water flowed backwards - 'No
proof can be brought from a stream of water,' they rejoined. Again he urged:
'If the <i>halachah</i> agrees with me, let the walls of the schoolhouse
prove it,' whereupon the walls inclined to fall. But R. Joshua rebuked them,
saying: 'When scholars are engaged in a <i>halachic</i> dispute, what have ye
to interfere?' Hence they did not fall, in honor of R. Joshua, nor did they
resume the upright, in honor of R. Eliezer; and they are still standing thus
inclined. Again he said to them: 'If the <i>halachah</i> agrees with me, let
it be proved from Heaven!' Whereupon a Heavenly Voice cried out: 'Why do ye
dispute with R. Eliezer, seeing that in all matters the <i>halachah</i>
agrees with him!' But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: 'It is not in heaven.'
What did he mean by this? - Said R. Jeremiah: That the <i>Torah</i> had
already been given at Mount Sinai; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice,
because Thou hast long since written in the <i>Torah</i> at Mount Sinai,
After the majority must one incline.

The <i>Mitzvot</i> presented in this book are my and Dr. Juster's offered
suggestions for Messianic Jewish (New Covenant) <i>halachah</i>, but can only
become <i>halachah</i> if and when they are received as such by a Messianic
Jewish community.
