<u>1 Corinthians 11:4-16</u>
<br>
<i>Every man who prays or prophesies wearing something down over his head
brings shame to his head, but every woman who prays or prophesies with her
head unveiled brings shame to her head - there is no difference between her
and a woman who has had her head shaved. For if a woman is not veiled, let
her also have her hair cut short; but if it is shameful for a woman to wear
her hair cut short or to have her head shaved, then let her be veiled. For a
man indeed should not have his head veiled, because he is the image and
glory of God, and the woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from
woman, but woman from man; and indeed man was not created for the sake of
the woman but woman for the sake of the man. The reason a woman should show
by veiling her head that she is under authority has to do with the angels.
Nevertheless, in union with the Lord neither is woman independent of man nor
is man independent of woman; for as the woman was made from the man, so also
the man is now born through the woman. But everything is from God. Decide
for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God when she is
unveiled? Doesn&#039;t the nature of things itself teach you that a man who
wears his hair long degrades himself? But a woman who wears her hair long
enhances her appearance, because her hair has been given to her as a
covering. However, if anyone wants to argue about it, the fact remains that
we have no such custom, nor do the Messianic communities of God.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
A common feature of the Scriptures supporting this <i>Mitzvah</i> is that
they speak against conduct that detracts from some aspect of God's holy
order. By "holy order" I mean the natural order of things from the creation,
before the "Fall", that reflects God's will and perfection. One would hope
that the Scriptures cited are self-evident and that man would want to obey
them. Sadly, however, there are many perversions rampant in today's society,
and ungodly forces agitating to hold them out as acceptable.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures that teach against wearing two species of thread (animal wool
and vegetable linen) or sowing two species of seeds are symbolic of not
mating two species of animals. With modern manufactured clothing such as we
wear, it is not possible to know what kinds of threads have been used to make
our clothing, but modern clothing is not known to combine wool and linen.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Today there is no universal standard of what constitutes a male or female
garment. It is defined by the culture in which the garment is worn, and
tends to change over time. For example, women in the western countries wear
slacks, whereas in years gone by they did not because slacks were then
thought to be for men only.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The prohibitions against marking one's skin, cutting one's flesh, and
trimming one's hair and beard in certain styles deserve special mention
because tattooing, body piercing, and bizarre hair styles have become
increasingly popular. The commandments prohibiting them were given at a time
when each of them was a recognized heathen practice, and anyone who exhibited
any one of them was, essentially, declaring himself to be an idolater.
Castration also mars the body, but its affect is more profound and will be
dealt with separately elsewhere.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is still the case that permanent markings, disfigurements, extreme hair
styles, and cross-dressing are with us today. Idol worship in its classical
sense is no longer the issue, but rebellion against godly norms is, as is
illustrated by "Punk" and "Goth" appearances that emphasize darkness over
light. In addition, tattooing, cutting, and gross piercing permanently
disfigures the body that God gave us and, for that reason, should be
understood to not be God's will despite any religious theme (e.g. a cross)
that a tattoo or item of jewelry attached to piercings may have. A believer
who receives one of these knowing beforehand that Scripture prohibits them
commits sin; one who receives a tattoo innocently has not committed sin, but
he or she should refrain from making it visibly obvious because of what it
implies. Once a tattoo has been received it is permanent, and if the wearer
repents in Yeshua, any sin that may have been committed concerning it is over
and done with. In my opinion, there is no continuing responsibility to
attempt to remove a tattoo surgically.

<b><u>Classical Commentators</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat the Scriptures cited herein similarly
and literally, and connect them to the practices of idol worshippers.
Gashing and balding the head (tearing out hair) over the dead are
illustrative of those practices. HaChinuch refers to God's evaluation of the
creation in <u>Genesis 1:31</u>: "<i>God saw everything that he had made, and
indeed it was very good.</i>" To attempt to alter what God made is therefore
very bad, and is sin.
