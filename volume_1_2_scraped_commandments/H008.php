<i>Don&#039;t you know that those of us who have been immersed into the Messiah
Yeshua have been immersed into his death? Through immersion into his death
we were buried with him; so that just as, through the glory of the Father,
the Messiah was raised from the dead, likewise we too might live a new life.
For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will also be
united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was
put to death on the execution-stake with him, so that the entire body of our
sinful propensities might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved
to sin. For someone who has died has been cleared from sin. Now since we
died with the Messiah, we trust that we will also live with him. We know
that the Messiah has been raised from the dead, never to die again; death
has no authority over him. For his death was a unique event that need not
be repeated; but his life, he keeps on living for God. In the same way,
consider yourselves to be dead to sin but alive for God, by your union with
the Messiah Yeshua. Therefore, do not let sin rule in your mortal bodies,
so that it makes you obey its desires; and do not offer any part of
yourselves to sin as an instrument for wickedness. On the contrary, offer
yourselves to God as people alive from the dead, and your various parts to
God as instruments for righteousness.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The plethora of Scriptures that exhort us to die to our self-interests are
due to the inclination of fallen man to dwell on himself and to put his
interests above those of others. Still, we cannot completely ignore aspects
of our welfare or we cannot live. We have to eat, clothe and shelter
ourselves, keep from things unhealthy, and petition God to meet our needs
(yes, petitioning God is most certainly a choice that is in our
self-interest). Several of the Scriptures cited above speak of "loving
ourselves", so "dying to self-interest" cannot be an absolute, and we
therefore need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to determine when and how much
each is needed.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We encounter problems when we step out of God's will by being legalistic in
either extreme - (1) putting others before ourselves in inappropriate
circumstances, or (2) putting ourselves before others in equally
inappropriate circumstances. A ludicrous example of the first extreme
(putting another's need before our own) would be our stopping to feed a
homeless man in the midst of our being severely injured and in need of
emergency treatment. An equally ludicrous example of the second extreme
(putting our self before another), would be our passing by an injured person
lying in the street because we are hungry and late for dinner. Although
neither of these examples are realistic, they do point to our need for God to
cleanse us of unholy self-interest that is common to fallen man, and also to
our need for Holy Spirit imparted wisdom in balancing our personal needs
against those of others in the various situations that we encounter.
