<u>Mark 12:14-17</u>

<i>They [the Pharisees] came and said to him [Yeshua], "Rabbi, we know that you
tell the truth and are not concerned with what people think about you, since
you pay no attention to a person&#039;s status but really teach what
God&#039;s way is. Does Torah say that taxes are to be paid to the Roman
Emperor, or not?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why are
you trying to trap me? Bring me a denarius so I can look at it." They
brought one; and he asked them, "Whose name and picture are these?" "The
Emperor&#039;s," they replied. Yeshua said, "Give the Emperor what belongs
to the Emperor. And give to God what belongs to God!" And they were amazed
at him.</i>

This <i>Mitzvah</i> to be subject to governing authorities is often debated
among scholars. We know by the <i>Mitzvah</i>'s date and context that the
governing authorities referred to included those of Rome, so the application
of <u>Romans 13:1</u> today undoubtedly contemplates secular governments on
all levels.

But how can the Scripture say that all authorities that exist have been
established and placed where they are by God, when evil governments such as
Nazi Germany are fresh in our minds? Should we have cooperated with Nazi
Germany rather than war against her? As absurd as that is, if <u>Romans
13:1</u> were the only Scripture on the subject, one might come to that
conclusion. But let us consider <u>Acts 5:27-29</u> which seems to say
something quite different; it says:

<i>They conducted them to the Sanhedrin, where the cohen hagadol demanded of
them, "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this [Yeshua's] name! Look
here! you have filled Yerushalayim with your teaching; moreover, you are
determined to make us responsible for this man's death!" Kefa and the other
emissaries answered, "We must obey God, not men."</i>

How do we reconcile <u>Romans 13</u> with <u>Acts 5</u>? Some have attempted
to explain <u>Romans 13</u> by asserting that it refers merely to Rome's
authority to assess and collect taxes. That, in my opinion is wrong. No, I
suggest that the answer lies rather in the definition of "authority" - that
not all persons and governments that claim to be authorities are, in fact,
authorities. Stated differently, an alleged "authority" is not an authority
if it is not from God. Any government that willfully commits gross sin or
that leads persons for which it is responsible into sin is no authority at
all, and we ought to oppose it. With that understanding, we can
unhesitatingly say that "we are to be subject to the governing authorities"
because true governing authorities are from God.
