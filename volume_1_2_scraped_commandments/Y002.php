it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the
vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much
fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me,
he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw
them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in Me, and My words
abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.</i>

put forth fruit by itself apart from the vine, so you can&#039;t bear fruit
apart from me. I am the vine and you are the branches. Those who stay
united with me, and I with them, are the ones who bear much fruit; because
apart from me you can&#039;t do a thing. Unless a person remains united with
me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up. Such branches are gathered

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is not possible for a man to bear no fruit at all. By merely being alive,
man will bear either good fruit or bad fruit, and Scripture makes it plain
that the choice is ours. Only good fruit results from our abiding in (being
united with) Yeshua, and he is quoted to have said: "<i>apart from me you
can't do a thing.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
That is not to say that isolated instances of good fruit can never come from
a person who is not united with Yeshua or that God cannot work His will
through an unbeliever. However, Scripture is exhorting us that if we want to
bear good fruit for God we must be (and remain) united with Yeshua, and then
(and only then) will good fruit from us be assured.
