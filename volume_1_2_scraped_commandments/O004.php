them to go. When they saw him, they prostrated themselves before him; but
some hesitated. Yeshua came and talked with them. He said, "All authority
in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make people
from all nations into talmidim, immersing them into the reality of the
Father, the Son and the Ruach HaKodesh, and teaching them to obey everything

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The term "Great Commission" does not appear in the text of the Bible. Its
origin is unknown, but the term appears to have been popularized by Hudson
Taylor (nineteenth century) to refer to Yeshua's instruction to his original
disciples (all Jews), to go to all nations and make the people from them into
new disciples. They were instructed to immerse these new disciples into the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teach them obedience to the commandments of
God as taught by Yeshua.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
According to <u>Matthew 28:16-20</u> and <u>Mark 16:14-18</u>, Yeshua's
disciples were to preach to all the nations. Prior to that (<u>Matthew
10:5-8</u>), they were given similar instructions but to go only to the "lost
sheep of the house of Israel." This and several other Scriptures indicate
that, whereas the "Good News" brought by Yeshua was (and is) meant for all
peoples, it was (and is) exceptionally important that it be preached first to
the Jews because they have the primary covenantal responsibility of reaching
the Gentile world for God. This covenantal responsibility was first
proclaimed to Abraham (<u>Genesis 3:8-9</u>, <u>26:4</u>), and was later
re-proclaimed through Moses (<u>Exodus 19:5-6</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Great Commission cannot be accomplished without the power of the Holy
Spirit. We read in <u>John 14:15-26</u> of how, when Yeshua left the earth
to be with his Father in heaven, the Father would send back the Holy Spirit.
And in <u>Acts 1:8</u>, we read that Yeshua's disciples had to wait for power
from the Holy Spirit before they could effectively be Yeshua's witnesses.
Finally (and consistent with that), we read in <u>Matthew 10:5-8</u> and
<u>Mark 16:20</u> that the effectiveness of the disciples' witness to the
non-believing world was largely due to supernatural signs of power that were
provided by the Holy Spirit. It is just as true for those of us who are
Yeshua's disciples today.
