<u>Genesis 17:4-16</u>
(Maimonides RP215; Meir MP47; Chinuch C2)
<br>
<i>"As for me, this is my covenant with you: you will be the father of many
nations. Your name will no longer be Avram [exalted father], but your name
will be Avraham [father of many], because I have made you the father of many
nations. I will cause you to be very fruitful. I will make nations of you,
kings will descend from you. I am establishing my covenant between me and
you, along with your descendants after you, generation after generation, as
an everlasting covenant, to be God for you and for your descendants after
you. I will give you and your descendants after you the land in which you
are now foreigners, all the land of Kena&#039;an, as a permanent possession;
and I will be their God." God said to Avraham, "As for you, you are to keep
my covenant, you and your descendants after you, generation after
generation. Here is my covenant, which you are to keep, between me and you,
along with your descendants after you: every male among you is to be
circumcised. You are to be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; this
will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. Generation after
generation, every male among you who is eight days old is to be circumcised,
including slaves born within your household and those bought from a
foreigner not descended from you. The slave born in your house and the
person bought with your money must be circumcised; thus my covenant will be
in your flesh as an everlasting covenant. Any uncircumcised male who will
not let himself be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin - that person
will be cut off from his people, because he has broken my covenant." God
said to Avraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are not to call her Sarai
[mockery]; her name is to be Sarah [princess]. I will bless her; moreover,
I will give you a son by her. Truly I will bless her: she will be a mother
of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."</i>

<u>Exodus 19:1-8</u>
<br>
<i>In the third month after the people of Isra&#039;el had left the land of
Egypt, the same day they came to the Sinai Desert. After setting out from
Refidim and arriving at the Sinai Desert, they set up camp in the desert;
there in front of the mountain, Isra&#039;el set up camp. Moshe went up to
God, and ADONAI called to him from the mountain: "Here is what you are to
say to the household of Ya&#039;akov, to tell the people of Isra&#039;el:
&#039;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on
eagles&#039; wings and brought you to myself. Now if you will pay careful
attention to what I say and keep my covenant, then you will be my own
treasure from among all the peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you will
be a kingdom of cohanim for me, a nation set apart [NKJ: "a holy
nation"].&#039; These are the words you are to speak to the people of
Isra&#039;el." Moshe came, summoned the leaders of the people and presented
them with all these words which ADONAI had ordered him to say. All the
people answered as one, "Everything ADONAI has said, we will do." Moshe
reported the words of the people to ADONAI.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The designation of Israel to be a "kingdom of priests" and a "nation set
apart" originated with the covenant that God made with Abraham. It was
renewed through Isaac and again through Jacob, and came into fullness with
the covenant that God made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai. We call the
covenant with Abraham "the Abrahamic Covenant," and the one at Mount Sinai,
"the Mosaic Covenant".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Although the Mosaic Covenant was given to Israel, its ultimate purpose was
not only to benefit Israel, but rather that, through Israel functioning as a
kingdom of priests, the rest of the world (i.e. the Gentile nations) would be
blessed. God's plan was (and still is) to bring His Word to the Jew first,
and the Jew to bring it to the Gentile. It doesn't always work out that way,
but that is the overall plan.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Edom, Assyria, and ancient Egypt have a special role in that plan as being
examples of the nations of the world that do not know God. The Israelites of
old had reason to despise these three in particular. Esau (the patriarch of
the Edomites) showed disdain for his birthright by selling it to his brother
Jacob, and he later hated his brother for it (<u>Genesis 27:41</u>). At one
point in history, Assyria (Iran today) subjugated Edom (which became an
Assyrian vassal state), and captured and subjugated the Israelites of ancient
Samaria. Both Edom and Assyria were, therefore, enemies of Israel at one
time, and Egypt became an enemy of ancient Israel as well. Although Egypt
first sheltered and provided sustenance for the Israelites, it later
oppressed and enslaved them.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
What is remarkable considering what has transpired, is that the Mosaic
Scriptures name all three as blessed nations, and though they (the three
nations) and their descendants may hate us and hate God's ways even today, we
are, nevertheless, to bring the "Good News" of Yeshua to them with love and
with the hope and expectation that some will receive it. In that way and
through our prayers and our example of being a servant people devoted to
loving God and neighbor, the Jewish people are uniquely commissioned by God
to be a light to their own ("the lost sheep of the house of Israel") first,
and then to the Gentile nations of the world.
