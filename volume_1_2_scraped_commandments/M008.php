<u>Genesis 1:26-28</u>

<i>Then God said, "Let us make humankind in our image, in the likeness of
ourselves; and let them rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air,
the animals, and over all the earth, and over every crawling creature that
crawls on the earth." So God created humankind in his own image; in the
image of God he created him: male and female he created them. God blessed
them: God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue
it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and every living
creature that crawls on the earth."</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> is derived from the above Scriptures that teach
(specifically or impliedly) that we must have humane compassion for the
animals of God's creation. Since acting cruelly is the opposite of acting
humanely, this Mitzvah could have been expressed as "We are not to cruelly
treat God's creatures over which we have dominion." The emphasis on
"dominion" (KJV and NKJV) is important in order to clarify that our rule over
God's created animals (as expressed in <u>Genesis 1:26-28</u>) is not without
limits. We can use animals for our benefit (and may even slay them for
appropriate and permitted reasons) but we are not to abuse them since they,
as we, have feelings on varying levels of complexity. The most primitive of
these feelings are pain, hunger, and procreative urges, but the higher forms
of animals have other feelings as well that we call emotions. Although the
relevance of each Scripture referenced above is, for the most part, clear on
its face, I nevertheless offer the following explanatory comments:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 20:9-10</u> and <u>23:12</u> compassionately extend Sabbath rest to
our livestock.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 23:5</u> requires that we help an enemy with his fallen animal,
thereby showing compassion for both our enemy and for his animal.
<u>Deuteronomy 22:4</u> is similar and broader in applying, as well, to those
who are not our enemies.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 23:10-11</u> commands that we not cultivate or harvest our land
during the Sabbatical Year, so that those who are poor among us (as well as
the wild animals in the countryside) can eat from that which grows of its own
accord.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 23:19</u> and <u>34:26</u> both state that we must not boil a young
goat in its mother's milk. Interpreting these Scriptures literally leads to
the traditional rabbinic prohibition against mixing dairy foods with meat
which, I contend, is not their intended meaning. Boiling (perhaps killing in
the process) a baby animal using its mother's milk - milk intended for giving
the young animal nourishment and life - is so perverted and inherently cruel
a use of mother's milk as to cry out to us: "Do not treat the animals of
God's creation inhumanely as do the heathens."
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Leviticus 22:28</u> teaches that slaughtering an animal and her young on
the same day is wrong. Why is it wrong? I believe it is because it shows a
callous disregard of the parental relationship that is holy even among
animals.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Deuteronomy 22:6-7</u> recognizes the probable maternal pain that a mother
bird experiences when she sees her eggs or her young taken for our
consumption. Releasing the mother bird first, spares her from witnessing the
fate of her offspring, and frees her to bear other young to replace those
that are lost.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Deuteronomy 22:10</u> reminds us that it is inhumane to yoke together,
animals that pull with different strengths, because the stronger of them
inevitably drag the weaker.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Deuteronomy 25:4</u> reminds us that it is inhumane to keep an animal from
eating in a place where there is a visible and tempting abundance of food.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Although human beings are among God's "creatures", this <i>Mitzvah</i> is not
intended to apply to human beings because humans do not have dominion over
each other.
