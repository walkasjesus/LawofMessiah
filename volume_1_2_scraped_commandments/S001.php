<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Homosexuality in the Bible means any sexual contact with a person of one's
own gender. As in much in the Bible, the relevant verses of Scripture read
as though they are written to men, but the New Covenant Scriptures make it
clear that they apply to women as well (<u>Romans 1:26</u>). The prohibited
sexual contact referred to is not limited to physically touching another
same sex's genitals; it includes any display, touching, conversation, and
probably even intentionally evoked personal thoughts of a homosexual nature,
engaged-in in order to cause sexual arousal. All homosexual acts are sinful.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
On the other hand, the Scriptures do not call homosexual feelings (or any
feelings) sin. There are some among us who (for reasons that only God knows)
were born with a dysfunction such that their sexual feelings are not
consistent with the gender of their physical genitalia. This is a most
unhappy condition that they must deal with by control and abstinence (i.e.
not allowing their actions to fulfill their desires), much as a heterosexual
person must abstain from heterosexual activity that is scripturally
prohibited. Persons having homosexual feelings that they do not act on
should be received within the body of believers without reservation, but
their condition should be viewed as abnormal, and prayer should not cease for
their healing. Also, it is important that their congregation's elders know
about their condition because any slippage of the flesh in this area is
almost certain to adversely affect others with whom they relate and come in
contact.

<u>Classical Commentators:</u>
<br>
Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch only address male on male homosexuality in
their <i>mitzvot</i>; they do not discuss women. They opine that the
expressions "uncover one's nakedness" or "lie with" in the Bible mean to have
sexual contact in which a male's sex organ is physically inserted into
another male's orifice (mouth or anus). This is sometimes referred to as
"sodomy".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Special mention is made here of all three commentators' peculiar
interpretation of <u>Leviticus 18:14</u>, which they interpret as not having
homosexual relations with one's father's brother despite the Scripture
speaking of one's father's brother's wife.
