<br>
<i>Tell Aharon and his sons, &#039;This is the law for the sin offering: the
sin offering is to be slaughtered before ADONAI in the place where the burnt
offering is slaughtered; it is especially holy. The cohen who offers it for
sin is to eat it - it is to be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of
the tent of meeting. Whatever touches its flesh will become holy; if any of
its blood splashes on any item of clothing, you are to wash it in a holy
place. The clay pot in which it is cooked must be broken; if it is cooked
in a bronze pot, it must be scoured and rinsed in water. Any male from a
family of cohanim may eat the sin offering; it is especially holy. But no
sin offering which has had any of its blood brought into the tent of meeting
to make atonement in the Holy Place is to be eaten; it is to be burned up
completely.&#039;</i>

<br>
<i>ADONAI spoke with Moshe after the death of Aharon&#039;s two sons, when they
tried to sacrifice before ADONAI and died; ADONAI said to Moshe, "Tell your
brother Aharon not to come at just any time into the Holy Place beyond the
curtain, in front of the ark-cover which is on the ark, so that he will not
die; because I appear in the cloud over the ark-cover. Here is how Aharon
is to enter the Holy Place: with a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as
a burnt offering. He is to put on the holy linen tunic, have the linen
shorts next to his bare flesh, have the linen sash wrapped around him, and
be wearing the linen turban- they are the holy garments. He is to bathe his
body in water and put them on. He is to take from the community of the
people of Isra&#039;el two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a
burnt offering. Aharon is to present the bull for the sin offering which is
for himself and make atonement for himself and his household. He is to take
the two goats and place them before ADONAI at the entrance to the tent of
meeting. Then Aharon is to cast lots for the two goats, one lot for ADONAI
and the other for &#039;Az&#039;azel. Aharon is to present the goat whose
lot fell to ADONAI and offer it as a sin offering. But the goat whose lot
fell to &#039;Az&#039;azel is to be presented alive to ADONAI to be used for
making atonement over it by sending it away into the desert for
&#039;Az&#039;azel. Aharon is to present the bull of the sin offering for
himself; he will make atonement for himself and his household; he is to
slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself. He is to take
a censer full of burning coals from the altar before ADONAI and, with his
hands full of ground, fragrant incense, bring it inside the curtain. He is
to put the incense on the fire before ADONAI, so that the cloud from the
incense will cover the ark-cover which is over the testimony, in order that
he not die. He is to take some of the bull&#039;s blood and sprinkle it
with his finger on the ark-cover toward the east; and in front of the
ark-cover he is to sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
Next, he is to slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the
people, bring its blood inside the curtain and do with its blood as he did
with the bull&#039;s blood, sprinkling it on the ark-cover and in front of
the ark-cover. He will make atonement for the Holy Place because of the
uncleannesses of the people of Isra&#039;el and because of their
transgressions- all their sins; and he is to do the same for the tent of
meeting which is there with them right in the middle of their uncleannesses.
No one is to be present in the tent of meeting from the time he enters the
Holy Place to make atonement until the time he comes out, having made
atonement for himself, for his household and for the entire community of
Isra&#039;el. Then he is to go out to the altar that is before ADONAI and
make atonement for it; he is to take some of the bull&#039;s blood and some
of the goat&#039;s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar. He is to
sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, thus purifying
it and setting it apart from the uncleannesses of the people of
Isra&#039;el. When he has finished atoning for the Holy Place, the tent of
meeting and the altar, he is to present the live goat. Aharon is to lay
both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the
transgressions, crimes and sins of the people of Isra&#039;el; he is to put
them on the head of the goat and then send it away into the desert with a
man appointed for the purpose. The goat will bear all their transgressions
away to some isolated place, and he is to let the goat go in the desert.
Aharon is to go back into the tent of meeting, where he is to remove the
linen garments he put on when he entered the Holy Place, and he is to leave
them there. Then he is to bathe his body in water in a holy place, put on
his other clothes, come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt
offering of the people, thus making atonement for himself and for the
people. He is to make the fat of the sin offering go up in smoke on the
altar.The man who let go the goat for &#039;Az&#039;azel is to wash his
clothes and bathe his body in water; afterwards, he may return to the camp.
The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood
was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, is to be carried outside
the camp; there they are to burn up completely their hides, meat and dung.
The person burning them is to wash his clothes and bathe his body in water;
afterwards, he may return to the camp. It is to be a permanent regulation
for you that on the tenth day of the seventh month you are to deny
yourselves and not do any kind of work, both the citizen and the foreigner
living with you. For on this day, atonement will be made for you to purify
you; you will be clean before ADONAI from all your sins. It is a Shabbat of
complete rest for you, and you are to deny yourselves. "This is a permanent
regulation. The cohen anointed and consecrated to be cohen in his
father&#039;s place will make the atonement; he will put on the linen
garments, the holy garments; he will make atonement for the Especially Holy
Place; he will make atonement for the tent of meeting and the altar; and he
will make atonement for the cohanim and for all the people of the community.
This is a permanent regulation for you, to make atonement for the people of
Isra&#039;el because of all their sins once a year." Moshe did as ADONAI had
ordered him.</i>

<i>With things so arranged, the cohanim go into the outer tent all the time to
discharge their duties; but only the cohen hagadol enters the inner one;
and he goes in only once a year, and he must always bring blood, which he
offers both for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the
people. By this arrangement, the Ruach HaKodesh showed that so long as the
first Tent had standing, the way into the Holiest Place was still closed.
This symbolizes the present age and indicates that the conscience of the
person performing the service cannot be brought to the goal by the gifts
and sacrifices he offers. For they involve only food and drink and various
ceremonial washings - regulations concerning the outward life, imposed
until the time for God to reshape the whole structure. But when the
Messiah appeared as cohen gadol of the good things that are happening
already, then, through the greater and more perfect Tent which is not
man-made (that is, it is not of this created world), he entered the Holiest
Place once and for all. And he entered not by means of the blood of goats
and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus setting people free
forever. For if sprinkling ceremonially unclean persons with the blood of
goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer restores their outward purity;
then how much more the blood of the Messiah, who, through the eternal
Spirit, offered himself to God as a sacrifice without blemish, will purify
our conscience from works that lead to death, so that we can serve the
living God! It is because of this death that he is mediator of a new
covenant [or will]. Because a death has occurred which sets people free
from the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who have
been called may receive the promised eternal inheritance. For where there
is a will, there must necessarily be produced evidence of its maker&#039;s
death, since a will goes into effect only upon death; it never has force
while its maker is still alive. This is why the first covenant too was
inaugurated with blood. After Moshe had proclaimed every command of the
Torah to all the people, he took the blood of the calves with some water
and used scarlet wool and hyssop to sprinkle both the scroll itself and all
the people; and he said, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has
ordained for you." Likewise, he sprinkled with the blood both the Tent and
all the things used in its ceremonies. In fact, according to the Torah,
almost everything is purified with blood; indeed, without the shedding of
blood there is no forgiveness of sins. Now this is how the copies of the
heavenly things had to be purified, but the heavenly things themselves
require better sacrifices than these. For the Messiah has entered a
Holiest Place which is not man-made and merely a copy of the true one, but
into heaven itself, in order to appear now on our behalf in the very
presence of God. Further, he did not enter heaven to offer himself over
and over again, like the cohen hagadol who enters the Holiest Place year
after year with blood that is not his own; for then he would have had to
suffer death many times - from the founding of the universe on. But as it
is, he has appeared once at the end of the ages in order to do away with
sin through the sacrifice of himself. Just as human beings have to die
once, but after this comes judgment, so also the Messiah, having been
offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to
deal with sin, but to deliver those who are eagerly waiting for him. For
the Torah has in it a shadow of the good things to come, but not the actual
manifestation of the originals. Therefore, it can never, by means of the
same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, bring to the goal those
who approach the Holy Place to offer them. Otherwise, wouldn&#039;t the
offering of those sacrifices have ceased? For if the people performing the
service had been cleansed once and for all, they would no longer have sins
on their conscience. No, it is quite the contrary- in these sacrifices is
a reminder of sins, year after year. For it is impossible that the blood
of bulls and goats should take away sins. This is why, on coming into the
world, he says, "It has not been your will to have an animal sacrifice and
a meal offering; rather, you have prepared for me a body. No, you have not
been pleased with burnt offerings and sin offerings. Then I said,
&#039;Look! In the scroll of the book it is written about me. I have come
to do your will.&#039;" In saying first, "You neither willed nor were
pleased with animal sacrifices, meal offerings, burnt offerings and sin
offerings," things which are offered in accordance with the Torah; and
then, "Look, I have come to do your will"; he takes away the first system
in order to set up the second. It is in connection with this will that we
have been separated for God and made holy, once and for all, through the
offering of Yeshua the Messiah&#039;s body. Now every cohen stands every
day doing his service, offering over and over the same sacrifices, which
can never take away sins. But this one, after he had offered for all time
a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God, from then
on to wait until his enemies be made a footstool for his feet. For by a
single offering he has brought to the goal for all time those who are being
set apart for God and made holy. And the Ruach HaKodesh too bears witness
to us; for after saying, &#039;This is the covenant which I will make with
them after those days,&#039; says ADONAI: &#039;I will put my Torah on
their hearts, and write it on their minds ...,&#039;" he then adds,
"&#039;And their sins and their wickednesses I will remember no
more.&#039;" Now where there is forgiveness for these, an offering for
sins is no longer needed. So, brothers, we have confidence to use the way
into the Holiest Place opened by the blood of Yeshua. He inaugurated it
for us as a new and living way through the parokhet, by means of his
flesh.</i>

was submissive - he did not open his mouth. Like a lamb led to be
slaughtered, like a sheep silent before its shearers, he did not open his
mouth. After forcible arrest and sentencing, he was taken away; and none
of his generation protested his being cut off from the land of the living

given a grave among the wicked; in his death he was with a rich man.
Although he had done no violence and had said nothing deceptive, yet it
pleased ADONAI to crush him with illness, to see if he would present
himself as a guilt offering. If he does, he will see his offspring; and he
will prolong his days; and at his hand ADONAI&#039;s desire will be

The 10<sup><small>th</small></sup> day of the seventh month is referred to in

Because the CJB translates the above Scriptures differently than do several

The CJB and NIV translate the four as "deny yourselves", and the KJV and NKJ
translate them as "afflict your souls". The NAS version differs by
translating the first three as "humble your souls", and <u>Numbers 29:7</u>
as "humble yourselves". The CJB and NIV both translate
<u>Leviticus 23:29</u> as "deny himself", the KJV translates it as "not be

The weight of lexical authority appears to favor (and I have adopted) the
view that we are commanded to afflict and humble our souls on <i>Yom
Kippur</i>. The question is "What does that mean?" and "How are we to
accomplish it?" Jewish tradition, based partially upon Scripture (e.g.
<u>Psalms 35:13</u>; <u>69:10</u>; <u>Jeremiah 36:6</u>), interprets "afflict
your souls" as meaning that we are to fast from food and drink for
twenty-five hours; this fast has become one of <i>Yom Kippur</i>'s most
well-known features.

While fasting on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is certainly appropriate and a practice
that I heartily endorse, I am of the opinion that THE TRUE BIBLICAL MEANING

<i>Shout out loud! Don't hold back! Raise your voice like a shofar! Proclaim
to my people what rebels they are, to the house of Ya'akov their sins. Oh
yes, they seek me day after day and [claim to] delight in knowing my ways. As

God, they ask me for just rulings and [claim] to take pleasure in closeness
to God, [asking,] 'Why should we fast, if you don't see? Why mortify
ourselves, if you don't notice?' Here is my answer: when you fast, you go
about doing whatever you like, while keeping your laborers hard at work. Your fasts lead to quarreling and fighting, to lashing out with violent blows. On
a day like today, fasting like yours will not make your voice heard on high.
Is this the sort of fast I want, a day when a person mortifies himself? Is
the object to hang your head like a reed and spread sackcloth and ashes under
yourself? Is this what you call a fast, a day that pleases ADONAI? Here is
the sort of fast I want - releasing those unjustly bound, untying the thongs
of the yoke, letting the oppressed go free, breaking every yoke, sharing your
food with the hungry, taking the homeless poor into your house, clothing the
naked when you see them, fulfilling your duty to your kinsmen! Then your

The theme and purpose of <i>Yom Kippur</i> is repentance, and the above
Scripture eschews any fast (including the <i>Yom Kippur</i> fast) that does
not include it. We are familiar with the discomfort of not eating, so
fasting might seem to be the primary and most logical way that God wants us
to afflict our souls on <i>Yom Kippur</i>. Consider, however, how much more
our souls are afflicted by our having to face the reality of our sins and
repent, often with confession and restitution. Although afflicting our souls
is called for, what is really sought from us is not bodily discomfort but
repentance.

Observance of <i>Yom Kippur</i> as a <i>Shabbat</i> and time for personal
repentance is mandatory for Jews and <i>K'rov Yisrael</i> Gentiles, and
recommended for other Gentile followers of Yeshua as well. Not only is
repentance important for us personally, but it is necessary if we are to
fulfill the priestly responsibilities that God has given to each of us.
According to <u>Exodus 19:6</u>, Israel has been made into a kingdom of
priests (albeit not all of Israel are descended from Levitical priests) and,
according to <u>1 Peter 2:9</u> and <u>Revelation 5:10</u>, all New Covenant
believers have become priests as well. This "priesthood of believers" is not
for the purpose of sacrificing animals in an earthly temple, but for serving
Yeshua who, as High Priest, entered the heavenly "Holy Place" by means of His
own blood sacrifice (<u>Hebrews 9:11-12</u>). So whether we are Jews or
Gentiles, all disciples of Yeshua carry priestly responsibilities for which
spiritual cleansing through repentance is a prerequisite. Note also that,
whereas animal sacrifices (accompanied by repentance) conducted in the Temple
merely covered over sins, Yeshua's sacrifice (accompanied by repentance) in
the New Covenant completely removes sin.

Scriptures which they understand to be saying "We must afflict our souls".
This <i>Mitzvah</i> agrees with them on that latter point, but does not agree
that afflicting the soul necessarily equates to fasting. Maimonides and
HaChinuch state that on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, in addition to resting and
fasting, we must refrain from all activities that care for the body; this
includes washing, applying oil to the skin, and marital relations.
Maimonides and HaChinuch also state that we are not to wear shoes, but Meir
limits this to not wearing shoes made of leather. The commentators do not
connect "afflicting the soul" with "repentance" and, in fact, do not discuss
repentance with any depth at all.
