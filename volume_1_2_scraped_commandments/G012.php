<i>For God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that
everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life, instead of being utterly
destroyed. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world,
but rather so that through him, the world might be saved. Those who trust
in him are not judged; those who do not trust have been judged already, in
that they have not trusted in the one who is God&#039;s only and unique
Son.</i>

<i>We are Jews by birth, not so-called &#039;Goyishe sinners&#039;; even so, we
have come to realize that a person is not declared righteous by God on the
ground of his legalistic observance of Torah commands, but through the
Messiah Yeshua&#039;s trusting faithfulness. Therefore, we too have put our
trust in Messiah Yeshua and become faithful to him, in order that we might
be declared righteous on the ground of the Messiah&#039;s trusting
faithfulness and not on the ground of our legalistic observance of Torah
commands. For on the ground of legalistic observance of Torah commands, no

<u>Galatians 3:5-14</u>
<br>
<i>What about God, who supplies you with the Spirit and works miracles among
you - does he do it because of your legalistic observance of Torah commands
or because you trust in what you heard and are faithful to it? It was the
same with Avraham: "He trusted in God and was faithful to him, and that was
credited to his account as righteousness." Be assured, then, that it is
those who live by trusting and being faithful who are really children of
Avraham. Also the Tanakh, foreseeing that God would consider the Gentiles
righteous when they live by trusting and being faithful, told the Good News
to Avraham in advance by saying, "In connection with you, all the Goyim will
be blessed." So then, those who rely on trusting and being faithful are
blessed along with Avraham, who trusted and was faithful. For everyone who
depends on legalistic observance of Torah commands lives under a curse,
since it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing
everything written in the Scroll of the Torah." Now it is evident that no
one comes to be declared righteous by God through legalism, since "The
person who is righteous will attain life by trusting and being faithful."
Furthermore, legalism is not based on trusting and being faithful, but on [a
misuse of] the text that says, "Anyone who does these things will attain
life through them." The Messiah redeemed us from the curse pronounced in
the Torah by becoming cursed on our behalf; for the Tanakh says, "Everyone
who hangs from a stake comes under a curse." Yeshua the Messiah did this so
that in union with him the Gentiles might receive the blessing announced to
Avraham, so that through trusting and being faithful, we might receive what
was promised, namely, the Spirit.</i>

<i>Does this mean that the legal part of the Torah stands in opposition to
God&#039;s promises? Heaven forbid! For if the legal part of the Torah which
God gave had had in itself the power to give life, then righteousness really
would have come by legalistically following such a Torah. But instead, the
Tanakh shuts up everything under sin; so that what had been promised might
be given, on the basis of Yeshua the Messiah&#039;s trusting faithfulness,
to those who continue to be trustingly faithful. Now before the time for
this trusting faithfulness came, we were imprisoned in subjection to the
system which results from perverting the Torah into legalism, kept under
guard until this yet-to-come trusting faithfulness would be revealed.
Accordingly, the Torah functioned as a custodian until the Messiah came, so
that we might be declared righteous on the ground of trusting and being
faithful. But now that the time for this trusting faithfulness has come, we
are no longer under a custodian. For in union with the Messiah, you are all
children of God through this trusting faithfulness</i>

<u>Hebrews 11:1-34</u>
<br>
<i>Trusting is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about things we
do not see. It was for this that Scripture attested the merit of the people
of old. By trusting, we understand that the universe was created through a
spoken word of God, so that what is seen did not come into being out of
existing phenomena. By trusting, Hevel offered a greater sacrifice than
Kayin; because of this, he was attested as righteous, with God giving him
this testimony on the ground of his gifts. Through having trusted, he still
continues to speak, even though he is dead. By trusting, Hanokh was taken
away from this life without seeing death- He was not to be found, because
God took him away"- for he has been attested as having been, prior to being
taken away, well pleasing to God. And without trusting, it is impossible to
be well pleasing to God, because whoever approaches him must trust that he
does exist and that he becomes a Rewarder to those who seek him out. By
trusting, Noach, after receiving divine warning about things as yet unseen,
was filled with holy fear and built an ark to save his household. Through
this trusting, he put the world under condemnation and received the
righteousness that comes from trusting. By trusting, Avraham obeyed, after
being called to go out to a place which God would give him as a possession;
indeed, he went out without knowing where he was going. By trusting, he
lived as a temporary resident in the Land of the promise, as if it were not
his, staying in tents with Yitz&#039;chak and Ya&#039;akov, who were to
receive what was promised along with him. For he was looking forward to the
city with permanent foundations, of which the architect and builder is God.
By trusting, he received potency to father a child, even when he was past
the age for it, as was Sarah herself; because he regarded the One who had
made the promise as trustworthy. Therefore this one man, who was virtually
dead, fathered descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and as
countless as the grains of the sand on the seashore. All these people kept
on trusting until they died, without receiving what had been promised. They
had only seen it and welcomed it from a distance, while acknowledging that
they were aliens and temporary residents on the earth. For people who speak
this way make it clear that they are looking for a fatherland. Now if they
were to keep recalling the one they left, they would have an opportunity to
return; but as it is, they aspire to a better fatherland, a heavenly one.
This is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared
for them a city. By trusting, Avraham, when he was put to the test, offered
up Yitz&#039;chak as a sacrifice. Yes, he offered up his only son, he who
had received the promises, to whom it had been said, "What is called your
&#039;seed&#039; will be in Yitz&#039;chak." For he had concluded that God
could even raise people from the dead! And, figuratively speaking, he did so
receive him. By trusting, Yitz&#039;chak in his blessings over Ya&#039;akov
and Esav made reference to events yet to come. By trusting, Ya&#039;akov,
when he was dying, blessed each of Yosef&#039;s sons, leaning on his
walking-stick as he bowed in prayer. By trusting, Yosef, near the end of
his life, remembered about the Exodus of the people of Isra&#039;el and gave
instructions about what to do with his bones. By trusting, the parents of
Moshe hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw that he
was a beautiful child, and they weren&#039;t afraid of the king&#039;s
decree. By trusting, Moshe, after he had grown up, refused to be called the
son of Pharaoh&#039;s daughter. He chose being mistreated along with
God&#039;s people rather than enjoying the passing pleasures of sin. He had
come to regard abuse suffered on behalf of the Messiah as greater riches
than the treasures of Egypt, for he kept his eyes fixed on the reward. By
trusting, he left Egypt, not fearing the king&#039;s anger; he persevered as
one who sees the unseen. By trusting, he obeyed the requirements for the
Pesach, including the smearing of the blood, so that the Destroyer of the
firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Isra&#039;el. By trusting, they
walked through the Red Sea as through dry land; when the Egyptians tried to
do it, the sea swallowed them up. By trusting, the walls of Yericho fell
down- after the people had marched around them for seven days. By trusting,
Rachav the prostitute welcomed the spies and therefore did not die along
with those who were disobedient. What more should I say? There isn&#039;t
time to tell about Gid&#039;on, Barak, Shimshon, Yiftach, David,
Sh&#039;mu&#039;el and the prophets; who, through trusting, conquered
kingdoms, worked righteousness, received what was promised, shut the mouths
of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, had
their weakness turned to strength, grew mighty in battle and routed foreign
armies.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> commands us to have faith in God and trust Him for all
things. Faith and trust are at the very heart of our relationship with God,
so it is no wonder that there are so many Scriptures in the Bible that speak
to it. Many Scriptures address it directly, and it is also built into the
Jewish life experience through the <i>Sh'mitah</i>, the Year of Jubilee, and
the various Sabbaths that require that we rest ourselves and/or our land,
cancel debts, and return our land to its original owners every fifty years.
All of these require that we put ourselves in God's hands and trust Him to
provide for us and protect us.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Scripturally, there is no difference between faith and trust as we may see

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
CJB: <i>Trusting is being confident of what we hope for, convinced about
things we do not see.</i>

things not seen.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This connection of trust and faith to our not seeing is vitally important.
When we exercise faith, it is not only that we do not see God; that is always
the case. It is that we do not see or understand the circumstance or the
issue for which we trust Him, and we must therefore make ourselves vulnerable
to Him and rely solely on Him. The extent to which we do that betrays how
discipled we are. If we are new in the Lord, we likely give ourselves over
to Him periodically and on a case by case basis. The ideal, however, is that
our walk with God is one of continuous reliance and continuous trust as it
appears was the case with Enoch in <u>Genesis 5:24</u>:
