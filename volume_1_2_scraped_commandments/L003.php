<br>
<i>A man from the family of Levi took a woman also descended from Levi as his
wife. When she conceived and had a son, upon seeing what a fine child he
was, she hid him for three months. When she could no longer hide him, she
took a papyrus basket, coated it with clay and tar, put the child in it and
placed it among the reeds on the riverbank. His sister stood at a distance
to see what would happen to him. The daughter of Pharaoh [a Gentile] came
down to bathe in the river while her maids-in-attendance walked along the
riverside. Spotting the basket among the reeds, she sent her slave-girl to
get it. She opened it and looked inside, and there in front of her was a
crying baby boy! Moved with pity, she said, "This must be one of the
Hebrews&#039; children." At this point, his sister said to Pharaoh&#039;s
daughter, "Would you like me to go and find you one of the Hebrew women to
nurse the baby for you?" Pharaoh&#039;s daughter answered, "Yes, go." So
the girl went and called the baby&#039;s own mother. Pharaoh&#039;s daughter
told her, "Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will pay you for
doing it." So the woman took the child and nursed it. Then, when the child
had grown some, she brought him to Pharaoh&#039;s daughter; and she began to
raise him as her son. She called him Moshe [pull out], explaining, "Because
I pulled him out of the water.</i>

by a well, the seven daughters of the priest of Midyan came to draw water.
They had filled the troughs to water their father&#039;s sheep, when the
shepherds came and tried to drive them away. But Moshe got up and defended
them; then he watered their sheep. When they came to Re&#039;u&#039;el their
father, he said, "How come you&#039;re back so soon today?" They answered,
"An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds; more than that, he drew water
for us and watered the sheep." He asked his daughters, "Where is he? Why
did you leave the man there? Invite him to have something to eat." Moshe was
glad to stay on with the man, and he gave Moshe his daughter Tzipporah [<b>a

[foreigner there], for he said, "I have been a foreigner in a foreign

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> prohibits excluding Gentiles from Jewish communities. A
Jewish community that is the kind of which I am speaking has Jewish members,
governing and pastoral leaders, organized prayer that is culturally Jewish,
Bible and/or <i>Torah</i> studies, table fellowship, an adherence to biblical
<i>halachah</i> as it applies to Jews, and a shared Jewish style of life.
Even a casual perusal of the Scriptures presented in this <i>Mitzvah</i> will
demonstrate that, throughout Jewish history, there have always been Gentiles
that resided alongside, and participated with, their Jewish brothers within
Jewish communities. So close was the communal relationship between Jews and
<i>gerim</i> (committed Gentiles) during the Mosaic Covenant era, that God
provided for there to be an inheritance of land given to Gentiles that was
within the territory of a tribe with whom a Gentile was living (<u>Ezekiel
47:21-23</u>).

The relationship gets even closer in the New Covenant where, according to
<u>Romans 11:16-18</u>, Gentile believers in Yeshua become connected to their
Messianic Jewish brothers and to the Jewish people globally by figuratively
being grafted into, and becoming branches on, a cultivated olive tree that is
owned by Israel (the Jewish people):

<i>Now if the hallah offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole loaf.
And if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches
were broken off, and you - a wild olive - were grafted in among them and have
become equal sharers in the rich root of the olive tree, then don't boast as
if you were better than the branches! However, if you do boast, remember that
you are not supporting the root, the root is supporting you.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We know that the olive tree into which Gentile believers are grafted belongs
to Israel because we read in <u>Romans 11:24</u>:

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

tree!</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
What is more, we read in <u>Ephesians 2:11-14</u>:

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Therefore, remember your former state: you Gentiles by birth - called the

are called the Circumcised - at that time had no Messiah. You were estranged
from the national life of Isra'el. [Commonwealth of Israel in the New King
James translation] You were foreigners to the covenants embodying God's
promise. You were in this world without hope and without God. But now, you
who were once far off have been brought near through the shedding of the
Messiah's blood. For he himself is our shalom - he has made us both one and

Another reason that Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish communities
is the matter of table fellowship and hospitality of Jews to Gentiles that is
exemplified in the following Scriptures:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>John 4:7-10</u>
<br>
<i>A woman from Shomron [<b>a Gentile</b>] came to draw some water; and
Yeshua said to her, "Give me a drink of water." (His talmidim had gone into
town to buy food.) The woman from Shomron said to him, "How is it that you,
a Jew, ask for water from me, a woman of Shomron?" (For Jews don't associate
with people from Shomron.) Yeshua answered her, "If you knew God's gift,
that is, who it is saying to you, 'Give me a drink of water,' then you would
have asked him; and he would have given you living water."</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Acts 10:25-28</u>
<br>
<i>As Kefa entered the house, Cornelius [<b>a Gentile</b>] met him and fell
prostrate at his feet. But Kefa pulled him to his feet and said, "Stand up!
I myself am just a man." As he talked with him, Kefa went inside and found
many people gathered. He said to them, "You are well aware that for a man
who is a Jew to have close association with someone who belongs to another
people, or to come and visit him, is something that just isn't done. But God
has shown me not to call any person common or unclean"</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Still another reason that Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish
communities is the application of <u>Matthew 7:12</u> (see also, <u>Luke
6:31</u>):
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
And even another (and perhaps the best) reason for Jews to not exclude
Gentiles from their communities is that it is God's plan for Jews and
Gentiles to worship side-by-side at the end of times. We see this in
<u>Revelation 7:9-10</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for
anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language [<b>Jews &
Gentiles</b>]. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the
Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands; and
they shouted, "Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the
Lamb!"</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Would we think it proper for a Gentile community to exclude Jews? There were
many such communities in the United States in the past, but thankfully there
no longer are - at least officially.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
While Gentiles should not be excluded from Jewish congregations and other
Jewish community entities, there are some situations where Jews caucusing
with Jews may be appropriate - a Jewish discussion group on Jewish topics for
example. I do believe it is important for Jewish disciples of Yeshua to
fellowship in communities where their Jewish identities, life patterns, and
covenant responsibilities are encouraged. For that reason, Gentiles that
join and commit themselves to a Messianic Jewish congregation should adopt
the congregation's Jewish ways of being, and not try to influence it to
become Christian in culture. That notwithstanding, some aspects of
<i>Torah</i> apply differently to Jews and Gentiles.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
I should like to add perspective to the preceding section 6, "<i>Gentiles who
live among Jews allowed to eat the Passover lamb if circumcised</i>"
(<u>Exodus 12:43-49</u>). There is a change of application in the New
Covenant where Gentiles are not encouraged to be circumcised in order to eat
the Passover. Yeshua is now our Passover Lamb, and we share the Lamb
together in the Lord's Supper without Gentiles having to be circumcised. The
teaching of the New Covenant is that Gentiles are fully included without
circumcision, contrary to the orientation of the Mosaic era. There are
promises and commands that both share equally while, at the same time,
distinctions of calling are preserved and lived out in different ways
(<u>Romans 11:28-29</u>). Both share in an equality of priestly status
(<u>Ephesians 2:5</u>; <u>1 Peter 2:10</u>) with different out-workings of
their respective priestly callings. An example of this is the general
calling of the Jewish people to respond to God's promise of their return to
the Land of Israel, and to the events leading to the Messianic Days.

<b><u>A Social Caveat</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are certain groups where the inclusion of one class of persons and the
exclusion of all others is socially acceptable. Examples of these are
age-specific groups such as men's and women's Bible studies, <i>B'nei
Mitzvah</i> classes, and married couples discussion groups. There are also
specific nationality and racial groups that are formed out of their common
interests, but their acceptability is usually due to their having a minority
status. So, for example, a Hispanic discussion group might be acceptable,
whereas an all-white discussion group almost certainly would not be. The
problem of social unacceptability surfaces most clearly when persons of a
specific race, religion, color, or ethnic origin, are excluded from a
community of the kind where people live, work, and worship together.
