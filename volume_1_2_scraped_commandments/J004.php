<br>
<i>Then the daughters of Tz&#039;lof&#039;chad the son of Hefer, the son of
Gil&#039;ad, the son of Machir, the son of M&#039;nasheh, of the families of
M&#039;nasheh, the son of Yosef, approached. These were the names of his
daughters: Machlah, No&#039;ah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirtzah. They stood in
front of Moshe, El&#039;azar the cohen, the leaders and the whole community
at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said, "Our father died in the
desert. He wasn&#039;t part of the group who assembled themselves to rebel
against ADONAI in Korach&#039;s group, but he died in his own sin, and he
had no sons. Why should the name of our father be eliminated from his
family just because he didn&#039;t have a son? Give us property to possess
along with the brothers of our father." Moshe brought their cause before
ADONAI. ADONAI answered Moshe, "The daughters of Tz&#039;lof&#039;chad are
right in what they say. You must give them property to be inherited along
with that of their father&#039;s brothers; have what their father would have
inherited pass to them. Moreover, say to the people of Isra&#039;el,
&#039;If a man dies and does not have a son, you are to have his inheritance
pass to his daughter. If he doesn&#039;t have a daughter, give his
inheritance to his brothers. If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to
his father&#039;s brothers. If his father doesn&#039;t have brothers, give
his inheritance to the closest relative in his family, and he will possess
it. This will be the standard for judgment to be used by the people of
Isra&#039;el, as ADONAI ordered Moshe.&#039;"</i>

<i>Here is what ADONAI has ordered concerning the daughters of
Tz&#039;lof&#039;chad: &#039;Let them be married to whomever they think
best, but they must marry only into a family from their father&#039;s tribe.
In this way no inheritance of the people of Isra&#039;el will move from one
tribe to another; for each of the people of Isra&#039;el is to hold on to
the land for inheritance belonging to his father&#039;s tribe. Every
daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of
Isra&#039;el is to become the wife of someone from the family of her
father&#039;s tribe, so that every one of the people of Isra&#039;el will
stay in possession of his ancestors&#039; inheritance. Thus no inheritance
will move from one tribe to another, for each of the tribes of the people of
Isra&#039;el will hold on to its own inheritance."</i>

<i>ADONAI appeared to Shlomo a second time, as he had appeared to him in

that you made before me: I am consecrating this house which you built and
placing my name there forever; my eyes and heart will always be there. As
for you, if you will live in my presence, as did David your father, in
pureness of heart and uprightness, doing everything I have ordered you to
do, and observing my laws and rulings; then I will establish the throne of
your rulership over Isra&#039;el forever, just as I promised David your
father when I said, &#039;You will never lack a man on the throne of
Isra&#039;el.&#039; But if you turn away from following me, you or your
children, and do not observe my mitzvot and regulations which I have set
before you, and go and serve other gods, worshipping them; then I will cut
off Isra&#039;el from the land I have given them. This house, which I
consecrated for my name, I will eject from my sight; and Isra&#039;el will
become an example to avoid and an object of scorn among all peoples. This
house, now so exalted- everyone passing by will gasp in shock at the sight
of it and will ask, &#039;Why has ADONAI done this to this land and to this
house?&#039; But the answer will be, &#039;It&#039;s because they abandoned
ADONAI their God, who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and
took hold of other gods, worshipping and serving them; this is why ADONAI
brought all these calamities on them.&#039;</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are three kinds of inheritance referred to in Scripture; they are (1)
financial inheritance (money, personal property and land), (2) royal
inheritance (e.g. kingship passing from father to son), and (3) moral
inheritance (i.e. non-tangible assets such as character traits and ethical
values. In addition, there are two mechanisms that govern inheritance - (1)
last wills and testaments, and (2) statutes of intestacy (i.e. rules that
govern inheritance in the absence of a last will and testament). All of
these date back to the time of Moses and before but, because today we live
under secular governments (not the theocracy of ancient Israel), today's laws
of inheritance are what govern.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Financial inheritance under Moses and today are the same in that they were
and are controlled by statute, albeit statutes that are different. The system
of financial inheritance under and prior to Moses was what we call
"primogeniture". It is where all the financial assets of a deceased person
are inherited by the person's firstborn or eldest son (sometimes firstborn
daughters inherited as well), who then become the family's patriarch and is
expected to use his inheritance to care for his siblings and their families.
Primogeniture still exists in places, but has been largely eliminated in the
western world where it has been replaced by laws of intestacy and "last wills
and testaments." Wills that are duly made and executed govern (within
limits) and, in the absence of a will, a person's financial assets usually go
to his spouse and children according to a statutorily defined plan.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Royal inheritance, where it exists in kingdoms today, is similar to how it
was at times in the past, in that it normally goes to the firstborn child
(sometimes the firstborn son) by law. In that way it is similar to
primogeniture in that the firstborn has responsibility to provide for his
siblings as kings have responsibility to provide for their subjects. King
David was succeeded by his son Solomon in what is sometimes referred to as
the Davidic Dynasty, and the kingship passed from father to son) until the
Babylonian exile in 586 BCE.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Moral inheritance is different from the other two in that through it, moral,
ethical, and religious values are conveyed through God's influence rather
than through law, but the result of conveyance is just as real. Within the
Jewish community (and some other communities) there exists what is sometimes
referred to as a <i>zava'ah</i> or "ethical will", which is a document
designed to pass wisdom and ethical and moral values from one generation to
the next. The idea of the ethical will is inspired by <u>Genesis 49:1-33</u>,
where Jacob prophesies over, and seeks to convey blessings to, his gathered
sons.
