<u>Matthew 10:17-23</u>
<br>
<i>Be on guard, for there will be people who will hand you over to the local
Sanhedrins and flog you in their synagogues. On my account you will be
brought before governors and kings as a testimony to them and to the Goyim.
But when they bring you to trial, do not worry about what to say or how to
say it; when the time comes, you will be given what you should say. For it
will not be just you speaking, but the Spirit of your heavenly Father
speaking through you. A brother will betray his brother to death, and a
father his child; children will turn against their parents and have them put
to death. Everyone will hate you because of me, but whoever holds out till
the end will be preserved from harm. When you are persecuted in one town,
run away to another. Yes indeed; I tell you, you will not finish going
through the towns of Isra&#039;el before the Son of Man comes.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures supporting this <i>Mitzvah</i> refer to attitudes violently
hostile to Yeshua that existed in the synagogues of First Century Jerusalem.
That notwithstanding, Yeshua's warnings are prophetic, and we see their
fulfillment even today. The attitudes of most synagogues are still hostile
to Yeshua, and although Jewish believers are no longer in mortal danger from
them, persecution through ostracization is still very real. There are,
however, many countries in the modern world where believers in Yeshua (both
Jews and Gentiles) are not safe due to their faith, and where Jews are not
safe merely for being Jews. We are warned to flee if we can, but we are not
to seek protection through denying Yeshua.
