<i>ADONAI said to Aharon, "You are not to have any inheritance or portion in
their land; I am your portion and inheritance among the people of
Isra&#039;el. To the descendants of Levi I have given the entire tenth of
the produce collected in Isra&#039;el. It is their inheritance in payment
for the service they render in the tent of meeting. From now on, the people
of Isra&#039;el are not to approach the tent of meeting, so that they will
not bear the consequences of their sin and die. Only the L&#039;vi&#039;im
are to perform the service in the tent of meeting, and they will be
responsible for whatever they do wrong. This is to be a permanent regulation
through all your generations. They are to have no inheritance among the
people of Isra&#039;el, because I have given to the L&#039;vi&#039;im as
their inheritance the tenths of the produce which the people of Isra&#039;el
set aside as a gift for ADONAI. This is why I have said to them that they
are to have no inheritance among the people of Isra&#039;el." ADONAI said
to Moshe, Tell the L&#039;vi&#039;im, &#039;When you take from the people of
Isra&#039;el the tenth of the produce which I have given you from them as
your inheritance, you are to set aside from it a gift for ADONAI, one tenth
of the tenth. The gift you set aside will be accounted to you as if it were
grain from the threshing-floor and grape juice from the wine vat. In this
way you will set aside a gift for ADONAI from all your tenths that you
receive from the people of Isra&#039;el, and from these tenths you are to
give to Aharon the cohen the gift set aside for ADONAI. From everything
given to you, you are to set aside all that is due ADONAI, the best part of
it, its holy portion.&#039; Therefore you are to tell them, &#039;When you
set aside from it its best part, it will be accounted to the
L&#039;vi&#039;im as if it were grain from the threshing-floor and grape
juice from the wine vat. You may eat it anywhere, you and your households;
because it is your payment in return for your service in the tent of
meeting. Moreover, because you will have set aside from it its best parts,
you will not be committing any sin because of it; for you are not to profane
the holy things of the people of Isra&#039;el, or you will die.&#039;</i>

chooses to have his name live you will eat the tenth of your grain, new wine

prospers you, you are to convert it into money, take the money with you, go
to the place which ADONAI your God will choose, and exchange the money for
anything you want - cattle, sheep, wine, other intoxicating liquor, or

poured olive oil on its top and named the place Beit-El [house of God]; but

<i>Look! I am sending my messenger to clear the way before me; and the Lord,

covenant, in whom you take such delight - look! Here he comes," says
ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot. But who can endure the day when he comes? Who can
stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner&#039;s fire, like the
soapmaker&#039;s lye. He will sit, testing and purifying the silver; he
will purify the sons of Levi, refining them like gold and silver, so that
they can bring offerings to ADONAI uprightly. Then the offering of
Y&#039;hudah and Yerushalayim will be pleasing to ADONAI, as it was in the
days of old, as in years gone by. Then I will approach you for judgment;
and I will be quick to witness against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers;
against those who take advantage of wage-earners, widows and orphans;
against those who rob the foreigner of his rights and don&#039;t fear me,"
says ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot. But because I, ADONAI, do not change, you sons of
Ya&#039;akov will not be destroyed. Since the days of your forefathers you
have turned from my laws and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will
return to you," says ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot. "But you ask, &#039;In respect to
what are we supposed to return?&#039; Can a person rob God? Yet you rob me.
But you ask, &#039;How have we robbed you?&#039; In tenths and voluntary
contributions. A curse is on you, on your whole nation, because you rob me.
Bring the whole tenth into the storehouse, so that there will be food in my
house, and put me to the test," says ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot. "See if I
won&#039;t open for you the floodgates of heaven and pour out for you a
blessing far beyond your needs. For your sakes I will forbid the devourer
to destroy the yield from your soil; and your vine will not lose its fruit
before harvest-time," says ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot. All nations will call you
happy, for you will be a land of delights," says ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot. "You
have spoken strongly against me," says ADONAI. "Yet you say, &#039;How have
we spoken against you?&#039; By saying, &#039;There is no point in serving
God. What good is it to obey his orders or to walk about as mourners before
ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot? We consider the arrogant happy; also evildoers
prosper; they put God to the test; nevertheless, they escape.&#039;" Then
those who feared ADONAI spoke together; and ADONAI listened and heard. A
record book was written in his presence for those who feared ADONAI and had
respect for his name. "They will be mine," says ADONAI-Tzva&#039;ot, "on
the day when I compose my own special treasure. I will spare them as a man
spares his own son who serves him. Then once again you will see the
difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the person who
serves God and one that doesn&#039;t serve him."</i>

<br>
<i>This Malki-Tzedek, king of Shalem, a cohen of God Ha&#039;Elyon, met Avraham
on his way back from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him; also
Avraham gave him a tenth of everything. Now first of all, by translation of
his name, he is "king of righteousness"; and then he is also king of Shalem,
which means "king of peace." There is no record of his father, mother,
ancestry, birth or death; rather, like the Son of God, he continues as a
cohen for all time. Just think how great he was! Even the Patriarch Avraham
gave him a tenth of the choicest spoils. Now the descendants of Levi who
became cohanim have a commandment in the Torah to take a tenth of the income
of the people, that is, from their own brothers, despite the fact that they
too are descended from Avraham. But Malki-Tzedek, even though he was not
descended from Levi, took a tenth from Avraham. Also, he blessed Avraham,
the man who received God&#039;s promises; and it is beyond all dispute that
the one who blesses has higher status than the one who receives the
blessing. Moreover, in the case of the cohanim, the tenth is received by
men who die; while in the case of Malki-Tzedek, it is received by someone
who is testified to be still alive. One might go even further and say that
Levi, who himself receives tenths, paid a tenth through Avraham; inasmuch as
he was still in his ancestor Avraham&#039;s body when Malki-Tzedek met him.
Therefore, if it had been possible to reach the goal through the system of
cohanim derived from Levi (since in connection with it, the people were
given the Torah), what need would there have been for another, different
kind of cohen, the one spoken of as to be compared with Malki-Tzedek and not
to be compared with Aharon?</i>

<i>I am not issuing an order; rather, I am testing the genuineness of your love
against the diligence of others. For you know how generous our Lord Yeshua
the Messiah was - for your sakes he impoverished himself, even though he was
rich, so that he might make you rich by means of his poverty. As I say, in
regard to this matter I am only giving an opinion. A year ago you were not
only the first to take action but the first to want to do so. Now it would
be to your advantage to finish what you started, so that your eagerness in
wanting to commence the project may be matched by your eagerness to complete
it, as you contribute from what you have. For if the eagerness to give is
there, the acceptability of the gift will be measured by what you have, not
by what you don&#039;t have. It is not that relief for others should cause
trouble for you, but that there should be a kind of reciprocity: at present
your abundance can help those in need; so that when you are in need, their
abundance can help you - thus there is reciprocity. It is as the Tanakh
says, "He who gathered much had nothing extra, and he who gathered little
had nothing lacking."</i>

brothers so that our boast about you in this regard will not prove hollow,
so that you will be ready, as I said you would be. For if some Macedonians
were to come with me and find you unprepared, we would be humiliated at
having been so confident - to say nothing of how you would feel. So I
thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go on to you ahead of me and
prepare your promised gift in plenty of time; this way it will be ready when
I come and will be a genuine gift, not something extracted by pressure.
Here&#039;s the point: he who plants sparingly also harvests sparingly.

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Tithing first appears in the Bible when Abraham gives one-tenth of the
increase of his wealth to Melchizedek (<u>Genesis 14:18-20</u>), and it
appears again in <u>Genesis 28:13-22</u>, when God promises Jacob blessing
and land, and Jacob, in turn, promises to return ten percent of that which he
is given by way of provision back to God. This was not, as some construe it,
an attempt on Jacob's part to bargain with God, but rather an expression of
Jacob's acceptance of the Covenant that had just been passed on to him, and
his acknowledgement that all things with which he would be blessed in
fulfillment of that Covenant belonged to God.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The tithe appears again as part of the Mosaic Law, in which the Israelites
were commanded to give one-tenth of their increase (usually crops and
animals) to sustain the Levites who had no inheritance of land. Offerings
over and above tithes, used for other purposes, are also prescribed in the
Mosaic Law (certain offerings were required and certain ones were voluntary),
but a percentage of income was not required of offerings as it was of tithes.
Finally, there was <i>tz'dakah</i>; giving to the poor and to good causes,
though not required, was expected and was considered a matter of moral
justice and not mere benevolence.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
What survives in the New Covenant of these three today is not a requirement
of law, but rather the principle of giving to God's work and to those in
need. One sometimes hears that tithing to one's church or synagogue <u>is
required</u>, and that is not right. One also sometimes hears that tithing to
one's church or synagogue today <u>is no longer appropriate</u>, and that is
not right either. The reason I can espouse these seemingly contradictory
things is that, like many things of the Mosaic Law, certain of its principles
find their way into the New Covenant, while the particulars and the
enforcement mechanisms of the Mosaic Law do not.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There is no true comparison of our congregational sanctuaries today to that
of the Tabernacle and Temple, except that they are (as the Tabernacle and
Temple were then) places where the believing community goes periodically to
meet God in prayer and worship, mediated through priests and a High Priest.
Years ago they were the Levitical priests and Aaron was the High Priest, but
now we (the priesthood of believers) are the priests, and Yeshua our Messiah
is the High Priest. There is another similarity of "then and now" in that
both institutions - the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and the synagogue -
have expenses of upkeep. In Mosaic times the expenses included maintaining
the Levites, and today it includes mortgage payments on our buildings, and
the salaries of clergy and other employees.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Whereas tithes and offerings were prescribed by the Mosaic Law for
maintaining the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and its priests, we have no
such law today but each institution today (synagogues, apostolic networks,
etc.) prescribes the way(s) that its members will maintain
it.<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup> In denominational synagogues, support of the
institution is usually through membership fees and charging for High Holy Day
seats, and in Christian churches and Messianic Synagogues it is usually
through members paying ten percent tithes on their income - a logical
adaptation of the Mosaic Law. As for special offerings and
<i>tz&#039;dakah</i>, they are as needed today as in the past because
membership fees and tithes cannot take care of every need. Messianic
communities take up "freewill" offerings to cover such needs, and members of
the traditional Jewish community often consider that charitable giving
(<i>tz&#039;dakah</i>) of ten percent is their minimum moral obligation.

In church history, a justification for enforced tithing by

The <i>mitzvot</i> compiled by Maimonides and Chinuch included the
commandments of giving tithes, offerings and <i>tz'dakah</i>, whereas Meir
wrote very little on the subjects - a reflection (no doubt) of today's
denominational synagogues choosing to not use tithes as their mainstay of
support.
