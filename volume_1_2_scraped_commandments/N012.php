<i>Now as for a person whose trust is weak, welcome him - but not to get into
arguments over opinions. One person has the trust that will allow him to
eat anything, while another whose trust is weak eats only vegetables. The
one who eats anything must not look down on the one who abstains; and the
abstainer must not pass judgment on the one who eats anything, because God
has accepted him - who are you to pass judgment on someone else&#039;s
servant? It is before his own master that he will stand or fall; and the
fact is that he will stand, because the Lord is able to make him stand. One
person considers some days more holy than others, while someone else regards
them as being all alike. What is important is for each to be fully convinced
in his own mind. He who observes a day as special does so to honor the
Lord. Also he who eats anything, eats to honor the Lord, since he gives
thanks to God; likewise the abstainer abstains to honor the Lord, and he too
gives thanks to God. For none of us lives only in relation to himself, and
none of us dies only in relation to himself; for if we live, we live in
relation to the Lord; and if we die, we die in relation to the Lord. So
whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord - indeed, it was for this very
reason that the Messiah died and came back to life, so that he might be Lord
of both the dead and the living. You then, why do you pass judgment on your
brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For all of us will stand
before God&#039;s judgment seat; since it is written in the Tanakh, "As I
live, says ADONAI, every knee will bend before me, and every tongue will
publicly acknowledge God." So then, every one of us will have to give an
account of himself to God. Therefore, let&#039;s stop passing judgment on
each other! Instead, make this one judgment - not to put a stumbling block

<i>The following day Moshe sat to settle disputes for the people, while the
people stood around Moshe from morning till evening. When Moshe&#039;s
father-in-law saw all that he was doing to the people, he said, "What is
this that you are doing to the people? Why do you sit there alone, with all
the people standing around you from morning till evening?" Moshe answered
his father-in-law, "It&#039;s because the people come to me seeking
God&#039;s guidance. Whenever they have a dispute, it comes to me; I judge
between one person and another, and I explain to them God&#039;s laws and
teachings." Moshe&#039;s father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing
isn&#039;t good. You will certainly wear yourself out - and not only
yourself, but these people here with you as well. It&#039;s too much for you
- you can&#039;t do it alone, by yourself. So listen now to what I have to
say. I will give you some advice, and God will be with you. You should
represent the people before God, and you should bring their cases to God.
You should also teach them the laws and the teachings, and show them how to
live their lives and what work they should do. But you should choose from
among all the people competent men who are God-fearing, honest and
incorruptible to be their leaders, in charge of thousands, hundreds, fifties
and tens. Normally, they will settle the people&#039;s disputes. They
should bring you the difficult cases; but ordinary matters they should
decide themselves. In this way, they will make it easier for you and share
the load with you. If you do this - and God is directing you to do it - you
will be able to endure; and all these people too will arrive at their
destination peacefully."</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"Judging" is forming an opinion based on evidence or perceived evidence.
There are two basic kinds of judgment: (1) temporal and (2) eternal, and
there are three authorities for passing judgment: (1) God, (2) mankind, and
(3) institutional. Temporal judgment is of the here and now, whereas eternal
judgment has to do with one's life with God in the world to come. The
authorities for eternal judgment are (first and foremost) God, but also
<i>batei din</i> (ecclesiastical courts) in which the body of believers
renders judgments that could have eternal consequences:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 18:15-19</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Moreover, if your brother commits a sin against you, go and show him his
fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you
have won back your brother. If he doesn't listen, take one or two others
with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or
three witnesses. If he refuses to hear them, tell the congregation; and if
he refuses to listen even to the congregation, treat him as you would a pagan
or a tax-collector. Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on
earth will be prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be
permitted in heaven. To repeat, I tell you that if two of you here on earth
agree about anything people ask, it will be for them from my Father in
heaven.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Temporal judgments are of two levels. The first is "merely forming an
opinion", and the second is "making a finding"; they may appear the same but
they are not. The first of these, forming an opinion, may lead to making a
personal decision such as whether to trust a person or be in a person's
company, but it is not, by definition, conveyed to another person lest it
constitute gossip.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Proverbs 20:19</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>A gossip goes around revealing secrets, so don't get involved with a
talkative person.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>2 Corinthians 12:20</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>For I am afraid of coming and finding you not the way I want you to be,
and also of not being found the way you want me to be. I am afraid of finding
quarreling and jealousy, anger and rivalry, slander and gossip, arrogance and
disorder.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The second level of judging (making a finding), is intended to influence
others and, if done rightly and officially (e.g. by a <i>bet din</i>), the
finding is binding on others such as when a court finds a party guilty or
innocent of violating a law.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There is a difference between judging "rightly", "rightfully", and
"righteously" (the opposite is judging wrongly, wrongfully, and
un-righteously):
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<ul>
<li> judging "rightly" means making a correct decision, and judging
"wrongly" means making a wrong decision. A person can be a proper
person to judge and still make a wrong decision.
<br><br>
<li> A similar term, judging "rightfully" (the opposite is "wrongfully")
has nothing to do with whether a judgment rendered is right or wrong;
it has to do with whether the person judging is a proper person to do
it (in legal terms, "has jurisdiction"). An example would be a person
that witnesses a murder and, without authority, convenes a trial,
judges, and convicts the murderer. The judgment is right because the
convicted person did, in fact, commit the crime. However, the person
judging the murderer has not judged rightly because he or she did not
have authority to convene the trial and appoint him or herself to be
the judge.
<br><br>
<li> Scripture requires that even when a person judges rightly and
rightfully, he or she must also judge righteously. That is, the
person doing the judging must not be in a state of unrepentant sin
while judging another. Scripture says that if you are yourself guilty
of that which you judge another, you are a hypocrite and pass judgment
upon yourself.
</ul>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is important to understand that, not only are there certain kinds of
judgments we should not make, but there are certain kinds that are required
of us. One that is often overlooked is <u>Galatians 6:1</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Brothers, suppose someone is caught doing something wrong. You who have
the Spirit should set him right, but in a spirit of humility, keeping an eye
on yourselves so that you won't be tempted too.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
And also <u>1 Corinthians 5:12b</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Isn't it those who are part of the [believing] community that you should
be judging?</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In order to be able to correct a fellow believer (or a family member), we
must first determine that he or she is doing something wrong, and that
constitutes making a judgment. It is not uncommon for those we seek to
properly correct to rebuff our correction by quoting <u>Matthew 7:1</u>
which, in the "King James Version", reads:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
As impressive as it sounds in the old English vernacular, it is an incorrect
application of the Scripture if it is spoken in order to avoid the
correction. The Scripture does not mean that it is improper for believers or
family members to correct one another. It warns a person who corrects another
that he or she is held to the same standard of righteousness with which he or
she is judging. This is made clear if we read further to verse five:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 7:1-5</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Don't judge, so that you won't be judged. For the way you judge others is
how you will be judged - the measure with which you measure out will be used
to measure to you. Why do you see the splinter in your brother's eye but not
notice the log in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me
take the splinter out of your eye,' when you have the log in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye; then you will see
clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother's eye!</i>

<b><u>Commentary by Daniel C. Juster</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The use of the <u>Matthew 7:1</u> phrase "<i>Judge not, that ye be not
judged.</i>" (KJV) has probably become the most popular biblical verse for
people who do not want to be accountable for their behavior, and teach that
no one should evaluate or judge them in any way. This is so obviously wrong
and foolish. We have to make judgments all the time. Should we trust the
vacuum salesman, the insurance man, the investment counselor and others?
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Bible says to have nothing to do with people who claim to be believers
who engage in certain sinful practices. In <u>1 Corinthians 5:1-13</u>, the
Apostle Paul instructs the Corinthians to judge a particular man who is
living in sin and remove him from the fellowship. Also, <u>Matthew
18:15-17</u> shows how judgment comes about. So what was Yeshua speaking
about in <u>Matthew 7:1</u>? Hypocrisy and not having a judgmental or
censorious spirit.
