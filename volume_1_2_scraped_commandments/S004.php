<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Fornication is sexual intimacy (sexual contact of any kind) between a man and
a woman who are not married to each other. One immediately notices that the
definition is quite broad and encompasses adultery, prostitution, and having
sexual relations with prohibited persons such as family members. Since these
other categories are dealt with separately in this compilation, this
<i>Mitzvah</i> on fornication will focus on what the Bible has to say about
sexual intimacy between two unmarried persons where prostitution (conveyance
of value for sex) is not involved. This kind of fornication sometimes occurs
between individuals who intend to marry, in which case it is called
"premarital sex," but it also occurs in casual dating.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are two things that make writing this <i>Mitzvah</i> on fornication a
challenge. The first is that there is no Hebrew or Greek word in the Bible
that means "fornication" and nothing else. The other is related to it; it is
that different translators of the Bible have decided how and when to use the
word "fornication," and some English translations (e.g. the NIV) opt to use
other words and do not use the word "fornication" at all. For the above
reasons, the approach to this subject I have chosen is to list and discuss
Scriptures that use the word "fornication" regardless of the English
translation from which they come.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In all cases where fornication is mentioned in the English Bible, it either
prohibits sex outside of marriage, or it is analogized to another activity
with which God is displeased. This negative attitude toward (or prohibition
of) sex apart from marriage is inferred by Scriptures in which a high value
is put on a woman&#039;s virginity. An example of such a Scripture is
<u>Leviticus 21:13</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"He [the High Priest] is to marry a virgin ..."
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Another example is <u>Deuteronomy 22:28-29</u>:<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
If a man comes upon a girl who is a virgin but who is not engaged, and he
grabs her and has sexual relations with her, and they are caught in the act,
then the man who had intercourse with her must give to the girl&#039;s father
one-and-a-quarter pounds of silver shekels, and she will become his wife,
because he humiliated her; he may not divorce her as long as he lives.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The lesson learned from these Scriptures is that sex between a man and a
woman outside of marriage is displeasing to God if not outright prohibited;
nevertheless, the word "fornication" is not used.
