<u>Exodus 14:10-14</u>
(Maimonides RN46; Chinuch C500)
<br>
<i>As Pharaoh approached, the people of Isra&#039;el looked up and saw the
Egyptians right there, coming after them. In great fear the people of
Isra&#039;el cried out to ADONAI and said to Moshe, "Was it because there
weren&#039;t enough graves in Egypt that you brought us out to die in the
desert? Why have you done this to us, bringing us out of Egypt? Didn&#039;t
we tell you in Egypt to let us alone, we&#039;ll just go on being slaves for
the Egyptians? It would be better for us to be the Egyptians&#039; slaves
than to die in the desert!" Moshe answered the people, "Stop being so
fearful! Remain steady, and you will see how ADONAI is going to save you. He
will do it today - today you have seen the Egyptians, but you will never see
them again! ADONAI will do battle for you. Just calm yourselves down!"</i>

and he gives you a sign or wonder, and the sign or wonder comes about as he
predicted when he said, &#039;Let&#039;s follow other gods, which you have
not known; and let us serve them,&#039; you are not to listen to what that
prophet or dreamer says. For ADONAI your God is testing you, in order to

haven&#039;t known, neither you nor your ancestors - gods of the peoples
surrounding you, whether near or far away from you, anywhere in the world -
you are not to consent, and you are not to listen to him; and you must not
pity him or spare him; and you may not conceal him. Rather, you must kill

afterwards the hands of all the people. You are to stone him to death;
because he has tried to draw you away from ADONAI your God, who brought you
out of the land of Egypt, out of a life of slavery. Then all Isra&#039;el
will hear about it and be afraid, so that they will stop doing such
wickedness as this among themselves.</i>

you must appoint as king the one whom ADONAI your God will choose. He must
be one of your kinsmen, this king you appoint over you- you are forbidden to

acquire many horses for himself or have the people return to Egypt to obtain
more horses, inasmuch as ADONAI told you never to go back that way again.</i>

diviner, a soothsayer, an enchanter, a sorcerer, a spell-caster, a consulter
of ghosts or spirits, or a necromancer. For whoever does these things is
detestable to ADONAI, and because of these abominations ADONAI your God is
driving them out ahead of you. You must be wholehearted with ADONAI your
God. For these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to
soothsayers and diviners; but you, ADONAI your God does not allow you to do

you good and increase your numbers, so now ADONAI will take joy in causing
you to perish and be destroyed, and you will be plucked off the land you are
entering in order to take possession of it. ADONAI will scatter you among
all peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will serve
other gods, made of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors
have known. Among these nations you will not find repose, and there will be
no rest for the sole of your foot; rather ADONAI will give you there anguish
of heart, dimness of eyes and apathy of spirit. Your life will hang in
doubt before you; you will be afraid night and day and have no assurance
that you will stay alive. In the morning you will say, &#039;Oh, how I wish
it were evening!&#039; and in the evening you will say, &#039;Oh, how I wish

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures are clear that we are not to listen to those who would lead us
toward idolatry. Although they refer to physical idols and false gods,
<u>Matthew 6:24</u> and <u>Colossians 3:5</u> consider anything to be a "god"
or an idol that competes with the one true God by becoming man's master, or
that we put ahead of the one true God. Such idols can be money, sexual
immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, property, power, security, greed,
and others. Consequently, anyone who listens to those who lead toward such
things, violates this <i>Mitzvah</i>.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> incorporates two of the classical commentators'
<i>mitzvot</i> - to not listen to one who prophesies in the name of an idol,
and to not make one's home in the land of Egypt where one can be influenced
by Egypt's heresies and idolatrous customs.
