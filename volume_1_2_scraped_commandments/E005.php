<i>Ya&#039;akov broke the silence to reply. "Brothers," he said, "hear what I
have to say. Shim&#039;on has told in detail what God did when he first
began to show his concern for taking from among the Goyim a people to bear
his name. And the words of the Prophets are in complete harmony with this
for it is written, &#039;"After this, I will return; and I will rebuild the
fallen tent of David. I will rebuild its ruins, I will restore it, so that
the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, that is, all the Goyim who have been
called by my name," says ADONAI, who is doing these things.&#039; All this
has been known for ages. Therefore, my opinion is that we should not put
obstacles in the way of the Goyim who are turning to God. Instead, we
should write them a letter telling them to abstain from things polluted by
idols, from fornication, from what is strangled and from blood. For from
the earliest times, Moshe has had in every city those who proclaim him, with
his words being read in the synagogues every Shabbat." Then the emissaries
and the elders, together with the whole Messianic community, decided to
select men from among themselves to send to Antioch with Sha&#039;ul and

the elders, your brothers To: The brothers from among the Gentiles
throughout Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings! We have heard that some
people went out from among us without our authorization, and that they have
upset you with their talk, unsettling your minds. So we have decided
unanimously to select men and send them to you with our dear friends
Bar-Nabba and Sha&#039;ul, who have dedicated their lives to upholding the
name of our Lord, Yeshua the Messiah. So we have sent Y&#039;hudah and
Sila, and they will confirm in person what we are writing. For it seemed
good to the Ruach HaKodesh and to us not to lay any heavier burden on you
than the following requirements: to abstain from what has been sacrificed to
idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. If you keep
yourselves from these, you will be doing the right thing. Shalom!</i>

The word "conversion" has a particularly onerous meaning in the history of
Judaism because of its association with persecutions of the Jewish people,
and attempts to force Jews to "convert" to Christianity by abandoning their
Jewish identity and assimilating into the Christian Church. That
notwithstanding, the American Jewish community also uses the term to describe
the process of receiving Gentiles into the Jewish people by making them
Jewish "converts" (proselytes) and, as generally understood, fully Jews. The
modern Church and Synagogue have, generally speaking, come to use the term
"conversion" as a process by which the "converted" person becomes one of
their own flock, rather than as a process whereby one's heart is "converted"
from unbelief to one of repentance and faith. This is evident when some
Christian denominations do not recognize the baptisms of other Christian
denominations, and when groups or denominations within Judaism decline to
recognize conversions conducted by other (usually less observant) sectors of
the Jewish community.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The word "proselyte", derived from
<img src=images/word-proselytos-1.gif align=top height=25> (proselytos),
is used in the Septuagint (LXX) to refer to Gentile "strangers" or
"sojourners" in the land of Israel. Gentiles that worshipped the God of
Abraham appear very early in the Bible and, by the time of Moses, two
categories of "strangers" were recognized. They were those that were
subordinate to the Israelites, and those that took on full citizenry that
included membership in tribes, and even inheritance of land (see <u>Exodus
12:48-49</u> and <u>Ezekiel 47:21-23</u>). The practice of receiving
Gentiles into Israel continued throughout the centuries and today, the terms
"Jewish proselyte" and "Jewish convert" are synonymous, and refer to former
Gentiles who have irreversibly taken on covenantal Jewish identity that is
subsequently conveyed to their children (through inheritance) <i>dor
l'dor</i>. From the time of their "conversions", these proselytes or
converts are considered, by the Jewish community, to be Jews in every way.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It was inevitable that the matter of "conversion" would make its way into
Messianic Judaism. It has always been an issue among us because of desire for
unity in mixed marriages, because there are Gentiles within our congregations
who perceive that they are called to become Jewish for various reasons (some
good and some not so good), and because some Messianic Jewish congregations
limit certain aspects of synagogue life to Jews. In tension with it, the
biblical legitimacy of conversion has been questioned, principally because of
the admonitions of the Apostle Paul to Gentiles in <u>1 Corinthians
7:17-20</u> and <u>Galatians 5:1-6, 11-13</u> that they should not be
circumcised, and because of the instruction to Gentiles in <u>Acts 15</u>
that they are exempt from the requirement of full <i>Torah</i> observance for
salvation.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is Tikkun's opinion (and the opinion of the authors herein), that the
conversion of Gentiles to becoming Jewish proselytes should be discouraged in
most cases, but that there are exceptions (illustrated by <u>Ruth 1:16-17</u>
and <u>Esther 8:17b</u>) where it should be allowed. Related to this, it has
been noticed there are two categories of Gentiles that populate Messianic
Jewish congregations today, analogous to two categories that existed within
Israel during the time of Moses. Back then there were those that were
genuinely and permanently joined to the nation and the God of Israel (similar
to the Gentiles that accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt), and there were
those that lived in proximity to the camp of Israel and did business with the
Israelites, but remained unaffiliated with the community. Today it is
different of course, due to the New Covenant. Today, all Gentiles who
receive Yeshua as Lord and Messiah are supernaturally grafted into the
"<u>Romans 11</u> olive tree," and become equal citizens along with all
Jewish believers in Yeshua, in what is termed the "commonwealth of Israel"
(<u>Ephesians 2:12</u>, NKJ). The Gentiles that are part of this
"Commonwealth" of faith comprise the larger circle of Gentile believers. They
are joined to the Jewish people by genuine affiliation, but there is an inner
circle as well.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Most Gentile citizens of the Commonwealth, while recognizing their grafted-in
relationship with the Jewish people, do not consider themselves to be (nor do
they want to be) part of the Jewish community per se; these are the believers
that we call "Christians". There are, however, some Gentile citizens of the
commonwealth who are called by God to have a special and permanent connection
to the Jewish community - to live among Jews (Messianic Jews preferably), to
maintain a <i>Torah</i>-observant New Covenant lifestyle, to marry Messianic
Jewish believers or Gentiles similarly called, to raise their children in
Messianic Jewish life, and to participate in Messianic Jewish covenantal
responsibilities along with their Jewish comrades. Tikkun designates
Gentiles who are so called to be known as <i>K'rovei Yisrael</i> (singular
<i>K'rov Yisrael</i>), - "those who are closely related to
Israel."<sup><small><a name=fr4 href=#fn4>4</a></small></sup>
We use this term to recognize Gentiles who are a genuine part of the Jewish
community, but who have not converted to become Jews.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Because a Jew and Gentile who marry produce Jewish children, for the sake of
Jewish continuity we discourage Messianic Jews from marrying those who would
raise their family outside of the Messianic Jewish community even if both are
believers in Yeshua. Mixed marriages of Messianic Jews and <i>K'rovei
Yisrael</i> are non-problematic, however, because they both have lifelong
callings to the Jewish people, and are therefore certain to bring their
children up to understand and embrace their Jewish identities and Jewish
covenant obligations. As for two <i>K'rovei Yisrael</i> who marry: They will
no doubt influence their children to be <i>K'rovei Yisrael</i> as well, but
they cannot guarantee it because <i>K'rov Yisrael</i> Gentiles cannot convey
their identities generationally as do Jews. Children of <i>K'rov Yisrael</i>
parents have a choice, and may believe that they are not called primarily to
live among Jewish people or to take on a Messianic Jewish communal way of
life.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
While we recognize the biblical legitimacy of Jewish conversion, we do not
encourage <i>K'rov Yisrael</i> Gentiles to convert because Gentile identity
(<i>K'rov Yisrael</i> identity included) is as important in serving God as is
Jewish identity. That notwithstanding, we consider conversion an acceptable
option for those <i>K'rovei Yisrael</i> Messianic Gentiles who are either
married to Jews, betrothed or engaged to Jews, legally adopted by Jews, or
who have a Jewish parent or grandparent and wish to acquire, re-acquire, or
affirm, Jewish identity.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We discourage conversions under non-Messianic Jewish (i.e. rabbinical)
auspices, but are of the opinion that we should receive persons as Jews who
are converted by any appropriate and reputable Jewish authority. The
procedure of conversion consists essentially of two parts: (1) making a
covenant declaration or oath before witnesses (similar to Ruth's declaration
to Naomi), and (2) acceptance of the covenant declaration by one or more bona
fide representatives of the Jewish community (Ruth was received, and her
marriage to Boaz was endorsed by the elders of their Jewish community). For
men, conversion also requires <i>brit milah</i> (covenant circumcision), and
we recommend <i>tevilah</i> (ritual immersion) in keeping with the custom of
our people.
