<i>While they were eating, Yeshua took a piece of matzah, made the
b&#039;rakhah, broke it, gave it to the talmidim and said, "Take! Eat! This
is my body!" Also he took a cup of wine, made the b&#039;rakhah, and gave
it to them, saying, "All of you, drink from it! For this is my blood, which
ratifies the New Covenant, my blood shed on behalf of many, so that they may

<u>*1 Corinthians 11:23-29</u>
<br>
<i>For what I received from the Lord is just what I passed on to you- that the
Lord Yeshua, on the night he was betrayed, took bread; and after he had made
the b&#039;rakhah he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
Do this as a memorial to me"; likewise also the cup after the meal, saying,
"This cup is the New Covenant effected by my blood; do this, as often as you
drink it, as a memorial to me." For as often as you eat this bread and
drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord, until he comes.
Therefore, whoever eats the Lord&#039;s bread or drinks the Lord&#039;s cup
in an unworthy manner will be guilty of desecrating the body and blood of
the Lord! So let a person examine himself first, and then he may eat of the
bread and drink from the cup; for a person who eats and drinks without
recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself.</i>

before I die! For I tell you, it is certain that I will not celebrate it
again until it is given its full meaning in the Kingdom of God." Then,

drink the &#039;fruit of the vine&#039; until the Kingdom of God comes."

<i>Yeshua said to them, "Yes, indeed! I tell you it wasn&#039;t Moshe who gave
you the bread from heaven. But my Father is giving you the genuine bread
from heaven; for God&#039;s bread is the one who comes down out of heaven
and gives life to the world." They said to him, "Sir, give us this bread
from now on." Yeshua answered, "I am the bread which is life! Whoever
comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever trusts in me will never be
thirsty."</i>

<i>"Yes, indeed! I tell you, whoever trusts has eternal life: I am the bread
which is life. Your fathers ate the man in the desert; they died. But the
bread that comes down from heaven is such that a person may eat it and not
die. I am the living bread that has come down from heaven; if anyone eats
this bread, he will live forever. Furthermore, the bread that I will give is
my own flesh; and I will give it for the life of the world." At this, the
Judeans disputed with one another, saying, "How can this man give us his
flesh to eat?" Then Yeshua said to them, "Yes, indeed! I tell you that
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not
have life in yourselves. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has
eternal life - that is, I will raise him up on the Last Day. For my flesh
is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks
my blood lives in me, and I live in him. Just as the living Father sent me,
and I live through the Father, so also whoever eats me will live through me.
So this is the bread that has come down from heaven - it is not like the
bread the fathers ate; they&#039;re dead, but whoever eats this bread will
live forever!"</i>

<i>The "cup of blessing" over which we make the b&#039;rakhah - isn&#039;t it

<i>Seudat HaAdon</i> (a/k/a <i>Shulchan HaAdon</i>) is known by a variety of
names in English as well; "Meal of the Lord", "Table of the Lord", "The
Lord's Supper", and "Holy Communion" are common. There is a mystery
surrounding <i>Seudat HaAdon</i> because Yeshua spoke of his body and blood
in present tense - i.e. "this is my body"; "this is my blood"; rather than
his saying: "this represents my body"; "this represents my blood." Also, in
his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul says of Yeshua: "<i>whoever eats
the Lord's bread or drinks the Lord's cup in an unworthy manner will be
guilty of desecrating the body and blood of the Lord!</i>" - again
identifying the bread and wine with his body and blood in more than a
symbolic way.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
These sayings of Yeshua have led the Roman Catholics to their doctrine of
"transmutation", whereby they believe that the bread and wine taken in
remembrance of Yeshua physically becomes his body and blood. While Messianic
Judaism does not accept that the bread and wine of Yeshua physically
transmutes, we do sense that when we take the elements of bread and wine,
something of a spiritual nature occurs that is empowering and beyond mere
symbolism.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There is another controversy surrounding <i>Seudat HaAdon</i>, and that is
when and how often it should be taken, and whether or not Yeshua intended it
to be a sacrament as distinguished from a remembrance that occurs in the
ordinary course of eating bread and drinking wine. Some say it is
sacramental and should only be taken during the Passover <i>seder</i> meal
since historically, that is the context in which Yeshua gave it to his
disciples. Some say it is sacramental but can and should be taken on other
occasions as well. Others say it is not sacramental, and that on every
occasion in which we eat bread and drink wine we should declare it in
remembrance of Yeshua.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is not my purpose here to prove or attempt to disprove any of these
theories, but my own position is that <i>Seudat HaAdon</i> is intended as a
sacrament to be taken during the Passover <i>seder</i> meal especially, and
periodically at other times throughout the year as well. I do not believe
that how often we take it is critical.
