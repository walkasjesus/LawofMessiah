will be honored in the sight of ADONAI, my God having become my strength -
he has said, "It is not enough that you are merely my servant to raise up
the tribes of Ya&#039;akov and restore the offspring of Isra&#039;el. I will
also make you a light to the nations, so my salvation can spread to the ends

people to trample on. You are light for the world. A town built on a hill
cannot be hidden. Likewise, when people light a lamp, they don&#039;t cover
it with a bowl but put it on a lampstand, so that it shines for everyone in
the house. In the same way, let your light shine before people, so that
they may see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven.</i>

Have nothing to do with the deeds produced by darkness, but instead expose
them, for it is shameful even to speak of the things these people do in
secret. But everything exposed to the light is revealed clearly for what it
is, since anything revealed is a light. This is why it says, "Get up,

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Because salt is essential for life, it is used in the Bible to symbolize
life. Related to it, light is used in the Bible to symbolize godly knowledge
and understanding that leads to life. Yeshua said of himself in <u>John
9:5</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
And yet, in <u>Matthew 5:14</u> he told his disciples:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>You are light for the world.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Could both be true? Yes, both were true, for he told his disciples in
<u>John 12:35</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>The light will be with you only a little while longer. Walk while you have
the light, or the dark will overtake you; he who walks in the dark doesn't
know where he's going.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Yeshua was letting his disciples know that he was going away, but that he was
going to transfer his light to them so that when he left, his light would
remain. The Bible uses "light" to symbolize revelation and understanding as
far back as <u>Genesis 1:3</u> and, in <u>Isaiah 49:5-6</u>, Israel is said
to be a "light to the Gentiles" (i.e. the rest of the world). Therefore, when
Yeshua imparted his light to the original Jewish disciples (today all who
believer in Yeshua are his disciples), he did so with the expectation that
they/we would disseminate it throughout the world in his behalf.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"Salt" is also used symbolically in the Bible. In addition to salt being an
intrinsic part of our bodies and therefore necessary for life, it is used to
preserve food and to make food flavorful. By Yeshua saying that we (his
disciples) are to be salt for the earth, and by his warning to us not to lose
our saltiness, he is sending us forth to minister the truth and life of God
through both our words and through our "enlightened" examples that others who
have need of knowing God would want to emulate.
