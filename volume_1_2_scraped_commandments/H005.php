<u>Leviticus 17:3-9</u>
(Maimonides RN90; Chinuch C186)
<br>
<i>When someone from the community of Isra&#039;el slaughters an ox, lamb or
goat inside or outside the camp without bringing it to the entrance of the
tent of meeting to present it as an offering to ADONAI before the tabernacle
of ADONAI, he is to be charged with blood- he has shed blood, and that
person is to be cut off from his people. The reason for this is so that the
people of Isra&#039;el will bring their sacrifices that they sacrifice out
in the field- so that they will bring them to ADONAI, to the entrance of the
tent of meeting, to the cohen, and sacrifice them as peace offerings to
ADONAI. The cohen will splash the blood against the altar of ADONAI at the
entrance to the tent of meeting and make the fat go up in smoke as a
pleasing aroma for ADONAI. No longer will they offer sacrifices to the
goat-demons, before whom they prostitute themselves! This is a permanent
regulation for them through all their generations.&#039; Also tell them,
&#039;When someone from the community of Isra&#039;el or one of the
foreigners living with you offers a burnt offering or sacrifice without
bringing it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to
ADONAI, that person is to be cut off from his people.</i>

<u>Deuteronomy 12:2-5</u>
<br>
<i>You must destroy all the places where the nations you are dispossessing
served their gods, whether on high mountains, on hills, or under some leafy
tree. Break down their altars, smash their standing-stones to pieces, burn
up their sacred poles completely and cut down the carved images of their
gods. Exterminate their name from that place. But you are not to treat
ADONAI your God this way. Rather, you are to come to the place where ADONAI
your God will put his name. He will choose it from all your tribes; and you
will seek out that place, which is where he will live, and go there.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> is based on ones that Maimonides and HaChinuch wrote,
limiting sacrifices to within the Sanctuary court. Their reason for
highlighting this limitation was that the Israelites were to be reminded to
not sacrifice to (or in the manner of) foreign Gods. This instruction is
especially relevant in precluding our conducting sacrifices today at a time
when there is no Holy Temple, but it gives no hint of whether sacrifices
might be resumed if (and at such time as) the Temple is rebuilt, nor what
kind of sacrifices they might be if it is. Clearly, with the sacrifice of
Yeshua having occurred, they cannot be sacrifices for sin.

The few Scriptures included herein that prohibit the use of unauthorized
altars for sacrifice are but a sampling of many others that are in the Bible.

Maimonides and HaChinuch paraphrase closely the Scriptures upon which they
rely, and Meir chose not to write a <i>mitzvah</i> on the subject.
