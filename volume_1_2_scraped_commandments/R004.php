<u>*1 John 4:1-3, 6</u>
<br>
<i>Dear friends, don&#039;t trust every spirit. On the contrary, test the
spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have
gone out into the world. Here is how you recognize the Spirit of God: every
spirit which acknowledges that Yeshua the Messiah came as a human being is
from God, and every spirit which does not acknowledge Yeshua is not from
God - in fact, this is the spirit of the Anti-Messiah. You have heard that
he is coming. Well, he&#039;s here now, in the world already! ... We are
from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God
doesn&#039;t listen to us. This is how we distinguish the Spirit of truth
from the spirit of error.</i>

<i>The fact is that such men are pseudo-emissaries: they tell lies about their
work and masquerade as emissaries of the Messiah. There is nothing
surprising in that, for the Adversary himself masquerades as an angel of
light; so it&#039;s no great thing if his workers masquerade as servants of
righteousness. They will meet the end their deeds deserve.</i>

<i>The Spirit expressly states that in the acharit-hayamim some people will
apostatize from the faith by paying attention to deceiving spirits and
things taught by demons. Such teachings come from the hypocrisy of liars
whose own consciences have been burned, as if with a red-hot branding
iron.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The assumption of Scripture is that professions, teachings, and exhortations
of men are made in response to spirit influences that are either from God or
from the adversary. If a spirit bringing a teaching is God's Spirit, what he
says will be true; if not, it will be false. We must therefore test the
spirit of everything that is proffered to us so that we are not misled; <u>1
John 4:2-3</u> tells us how:
