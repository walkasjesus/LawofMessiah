[[Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh]] in a curse. So they brought him to Moshe. (His
mother&#039;s name was Shlomit the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
They put him under guard until ADONAI would tell them what to do. ADONAI
said to Moshe, "Take the man who cursed outside the camp, have everyone who
heard him lay their hands on his head, and have the entire community stone
him. Then tell the people of Isra&#039;el, &#039;Whoever curses his God
will bear the consequences of his sin; and whoever blasphemes the name of
ADONAI must be put to death; the entire community must stone him. The
foreigner as well as the citizen is to be put to death if he blasphemes the

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> re-formulates two of the traditional <i>taryag
mitzvot</i> into a <i>mitzvah</i> having three components. The traditional
<i>mitzvot</i> direct us to (1) sanctify God's Name, and (2) not profane
God's Name. The components of this re-formulated <i>mitzvah</i> direct us to
(1) treat God as holy, (2) proclaim God's holiness, and (3) not profane God's
Name. There is logic to linking them in this way. God proclaims His own
holiness, and requires that we acknowledge it by being obedient to these
three directives. God's holiness encompasses His entire nature that includes
His integrity, purity, trustworthiness, goodness, righteousness, justice,
compassion, love, and all His other attributes.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are other ways (in addition to these three) of acknowledging God's
holiness, but the key to them all is holding God holy in our hearts and
thoughts and reminding ourselves of it regularly. That is the purpose of the
third benediction of the <i>Amidah</i> and of the <i>Kedushah</i> - prayers
that are a part of most synagogue services.

Maimonides', Meir's, and HaChinuch's positive mitzvot RP9, MP5, and C296,
respectively, all draw, from <u>Leviticus 22:32</u>, the commandment that we
are to sanctify God (or God's Name). Their negative <i>mitzvot</i> RN63,
MN155, and C295, respectively, draw from the same Scripture, the commandment
that we are not to profane (or desecrate) God's Name. All three commentators
say, of their positive <i>mitzvot</i>, that we are to proclaim God to the
world and never deny Him - even at the risk of injury or death. We are also
to refrain from committing sin (especially sins connected to idolatry), since
sin dishonors God and, by inference, denies His holiness.
