<br>
<i>Speak to the people of Isra&#039;el, instructing them to make, through all
their generations, tzitziyot on the corners of their garments, and to put
with the tzitzit on each corner a blue thread. It is to be a tzitzit for
you to look at and thereby remember all of ADONAI&#039;s mitzvot and obey
them, so that you won&#039;t go around wherever your own heart and eyes
lead you to prostitute yourselves; but it will help you remember and obey
all my mitzvot and be holy for your God.</i>

<u>Job 1:13-22</u>
<br>
<i>One day when Iyov&#039;s sons and daughters were eating and drinking in
their oldest brother&#039;s house, a messenger came to him and said, "The
oxen were plowing, with the donkeys grazing near them, when a raiding party
from Sh&#039;va came and carried them off; they put the servants to the
sword too, and I&#039;m the only one who escaped to tell you." While he was
still speaking, another one came and said, "Fire from God fell from the sky
and burned up the sheep and the servants; it completely destroyed them, and
I&#039;m the only one who escaped to tell you." While he was still
speaking, another one came and said, "The Kasdim, three bands of them, fell
on the camels and carried them off; they put the servants to the sword too,
and I&#039;m the only one who escaped to tell you." While he was still
speaking, another one came and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating
and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#039;s house, when suddenly a
strong wind blew in from over the desert. It struck the four corners of the
house, so that it fell on the young people; they are dead, and I&#039;m the
only one who escaped to tell you." Iyov got up, tore his coat, shaved his
head, fell down on the ground and worshipped; he said, "Naked I came from my
mother&#039;s womb, and naked I will return there. ADONAI gave; ADONAI took;
blessed be the name of ADONAI." In all this Iyov neither committed a sin
nor put blame on God.</i>

hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, zither, lute, bagpipe and the rest

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The undeniable weight of Scripture is that we are to always acknowledge our
belief in God and in Yeshua the Messiah, and never deny it. Denial can be
by lying or through silence that is misleading. The most common reasons
that men deny their faith in God or Messiah are fear or to gain some
advantage.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Temptations to deny our faith predate the <i>Torah</i> itself. Consider how
Job was consistently urged to curse God, but he did not. That book was
preserved for us in Scripture, that we might follow Job's example when hard
times, danger, or even benefit befall us where logic and common expectation
tells us that we will fare better and safer if we lie or mislead someone
about our Messianic faith. The story of Job is one of success. Centuries
later, the story of Peter is one of failure, as he denied that he knew
Yeshua and that he was one of Yeshua's disciples - not once, but three
times.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The temptation to deny the Lord can be subtle, and can come in many forms.
Usually it comes from someone we want to please or someone we do not want to
anger. It can occur when a co-worker blasphemes the name of the Lord and we
do not (at the very least) walk away. It can occur when our employer makes
a rude remark about the Lord's chosen people and we do not correct him or
admit that we are one of them. It can occur when we go along with a joke
that mocks marriage, sex, or other things that the Lord gave us and cares
about deeply. It can occur when we hold back from witnessing to our
parents, or when, as Jews, we acquiesce to eating <i>treyf</i> in order to
be social. It can occur when we mislead another about our belief in Yeshua
in our attempt to pursue Jewish conversion or apply for <i>aliyah</i> to
Israel.

The Scriptures cannot be clearer, from the earliest in the <i>Tanakh</i> to
the most recent in the <i>B'rit Chadasha</i>. The <i>mitzvot</i> to wear
fringes (and by traditional understanding phylacteries) for all to see, to
display <i>m'zuzot</i> on one's doorposts (again for all to see), and to
cleave to God and love Him with all of our heart, being, and resources, are
the antithesis of denying Him.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Regarding Yeshua, the New Covenant Scriptures make it very clear that our
responsibility is to preach the Good News of His Messiahship, and that there
are dire consequences if we hide it or deny it.

In their respective <i>mitzvot</i>, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret
"clinging" or "cleaving" to God in <u>Deuteronomy 10:20</u> and
<u>Deuteronomy 11:22</u> as "associating" with wise men. Although in his
12<sup><small>th</small></sup> Article of Faith, Maimonides warns against not
believing in Messiah's coming or denying Messhiah's greatness, he makes no
reference to it in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>.
