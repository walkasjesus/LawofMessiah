God. He was with God in the beginning. All things came to be through him,
and without him nothing made had being. In him was life, and the life was
the light of mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness
has not suppressed it. There was a man sent from God whose name was
Yochanan. He came to be a testimony, to bear witness concerning the light;
so that through him, everyone might put his trust in God and be faithful to
him. He himself was not that light; no, he came to bear witness concerning
the light. This was the true light, which gives light to everyone entering
the world. He was in the world- the world came to be through him - yet the
world did not know him. He came to his own homeland, yet his own people did
not receive him. But to as many as did receive him, to those who put their
trust in his person and power, he gave the right to become children of God,
not because of bloodline, physical impulse or human intention, but because
of God. The Word became a human being and lived with us, and we saw his
Sh&#039;khinah, the Sh&#039;khinah of the Father&#039;s only Son, full of

Blasphemy is communicating disrespect for something that is sacred or someone
who is holy. Among believers, we often hear doctrinal statements espoused
as though they have nothing or little to do with each other. For example:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<ol>
<li> Blaspheming God is a forgivable sin, whereas blaspheming the Holy
Spirit is an unpardonable sin (<u>Leviticus 24:15-16</u>; <u>Matthew
12:32</u>).
<li> If we believe in our heart and confess with our mouth that Yeshua was
raised from the dead we will be saved (<u>Romans 10:8-9</u>).
<li> It is necessary that we receive the Holy Spirit in order to receive
power and spiritual gifts from on high (<u>Acts 1:8</u>; <u>1 Corinthians
14:1</u>).
</ol>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
These sayings are correct, but have we sufficiently considered how they are
related to each other, and why they are correct in view of their raising
perplexing questions? For example, statement #1 raises the question: "Why is
blaspheming the Holy Spirit unforgivable, whereas blaspheming Yeshua or the
Father forgivable?" And as to statement #2: "What is special about believing
in Yeshua as compared to God the Father and the Holy Spirit? Is it not
sufficient to believe in God broadly? After all, there are those in the
world that have never heard of Yeshua." And a question that may arise
regarding statement #3 is: "Why does God single out the Holy Spirit as the
conveyer of His power and gifts? Can we not receive God's power and gifts
directly from the Father and Yeshua without the Holy Spirit's intervention?"

The answers to these questions become clearer when we stop thinking of
biblical doctrines such as these as standing on their own, and begin to
appreciate them as interrelated. As a matter of fact, despite the prominence
given in some quarter to sayings #1, #2, and #3, none of them are primary.
What is primary and the umbrella for all of them is what is known as the
"<i>Sh'ma</i>" - <u>Deuteronomy 6:4-6</u> as explained by Yeshua in
<u>Matthew 22:34-40</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>... but when the P'rushim learned that he had silenced the Tz'dukim, they
got together, and one of them who was a Torah expert asked a sh'eilah to trap
him: "Rabbi, which of the mitzvot in the Torah is the most important?" He
told him, "'You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength.' This is the greatest and most
important mitzvah. And a second is similar to it, 'You are to love your
neighbor as yourself.' All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on
these two mitzvot."</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We cannot love God with all of our heart, soul and strength unless we know
Him intimately, and we cannot know Him intimately unless God reveals Yeshua
to us through the Holy Spirit (<u>John 6:44</u>). We cannot know Him by our
own knowledge and virtue - even by the Words of Scripture if the Holy Spirit
does not first soften our hearts and give us understanding (<u>Ephesians
2:8-9</u>). Then, once God and His nature are revealed to us, we have the
choice of whether or not to receive Him. If we do, the Holy Spirit takes up
residence in us, we are given a new spirit, our hearts become softened, and
we become open to more of God. If we do not, we keep our old spirit, our
hearts become hardened, and God becomes more distant to us over time.

But you say: "How do sayings #1, #2, and #3 fit into this? What about #1 for
example? What about trusting in Yeshua to be saved?" Consider the totality
of what <u>John 3:14-18</u> says:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Just as Moshe lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man
be lifted up; so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life. For
God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son, so that everyone
who trusts in him </i>[some translations say "believes in Him"]<i> may have
eternal life, instead of being utterly destroyed. For God did not send the
Son into the world to judge the world, but rather so that through him, the
world might be saved. Those who trust in him are not judged; those who do
not trust have been judged already, in that they have not trusted in the one
who is God's only and unique Son.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
For anyone to believe and trust in Yeshua we must be brought to that belief
and trust by the Holy Spirit, i.e. by God Himself who draws us near through
the Holy Spirit (<i>John 6:44</i>). Man cannot perceive the invisible God by
his natural senses so, without the Holy Spirit, there is no natural way to
know Him, and therefore no reason to believe in Him since we (presumably) do
not believe what the Bible says of Him either.

So, the Holy Spirit is needed in order for statement #1 above to be true. And
the Holy Spirit is likewise needed for statement #2 but, as valuable as
receiving power and spiritual gifts are, they are not as primary as knowing
God for Who He Is; that knowledge can only be brought to us by the Holy
Spirit. As for statement #3, if we blaspheme and therefore reject the Holy
Spirit, we cannot be brought to the place of knowing either God the son or
God the Father, and we therefore cannot be saved. On the other hand, if we
blaspheme the Father or Yeshua (sinful to be sure) but do not reject the Holy
Spirit, the Holy Spirit can eventually lead us to repentance and salvation.
That is why Scripture refers to blaspheming the Holy Spirit (and not the
Father nor the Son) as an eternal
sin.<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>

Thus far, I have spoken of receiving Messiah and the Holy Spirit and of their
respective ministries, but Scripture also speaks of an "immersion" or
"baptism" (<u>Matthew 3:11</u>), and a "filling" (<u>Ephesians 5:18</u>) of
the Holy Spirit as well. I believe that they are essentially the same, but
perhaps the baptism is an initial filling. Apparently, the Holy Spirit is
like a fluid, and we can have more of less of Him depending upon our
willingness to receive Him, and our repentant condition. We can have a
minimal amount of Him - just enough to bring us to the place of salvation,
and we can also be filled with Him, the result being that He can give us
spiritual power and spiritual gifts (<u>1 Corinthians 12:8-10</u>).
Oppositely, we can lose a portion of the Holy Spirit (drip-by-drip) as a
result of sin, and can be re-filled with the Holy Spirit if and when we
repent (<u>Ephesians 5:18</u>).

This <i>Mitzvah</i> and its accompanying Scriptures clearly show that the
triune persons of God work together, and that the Holy Spirit, along with
Messiah, is key to our relationship with God and to our salvation.

I do not believe that Scripture teaches that a momentary
blasphemous remark against the Holy Spirit leads to eternal unforgiveness.
I believe that Stern translates <u>Matthew 12:32</u> correctly in saying:
"<i>... but whoever keeps on speaking against the Ruach HaKodesh will never
be forgiven ...</i>"
