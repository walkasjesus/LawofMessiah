<i>ADONAI said to Moshe and Aharon, "If someone develops on his skin a
swelling, scab or bright spot which could develop into the disease
tzara&#039;at, he is to be brought to Aharon the cohen or to one of his sons
who are cohanim. The cohen is to examine the sore on his skin; if the hair
in the sore has turned white, and the sore appears to go deep into the skin,
it is tzara&#039;at, and after examining him the cohen is to declare him
unclean. If the bright spot on his skin is white, but it does not appear to
go deep into the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the cohen is
to isolate him for seven days. On the seventh day the cohen is to examine
him again, and if the sore appears the same as before and has not spread on
the skin, then the cohen is to isolate him for seven more days. On the
seventh day the cohen is to examine him again, and if the sore has faded and
hasn&#039;t spread on the skin, then the cohen is to declare him clean - it
is only a scab, so he is to wash his clothes and be clean. But if the scab
spreads further on the skin after he has been examined by the cohen and
declared clean, he is to let himself be examined yet again by the cohen.
The cohen will examine him, and if he sees that the scab has spread on his
skin, then the cohen will declare him unclean; it is tzara&#039;at. If a
person has tzara&#039;at, he is to be brought to the cohen. The cohen is to
examine him, and if he sees that there is a white swelling in the skin which
has turned the hair white and inflamed flesh in the swelling, then it is
chronic tzara&#039;at on his skin, and the cohen is to declare him unclean;
he is not to isolate him, because it is already clear that he is unclean.
If the tzara&#039;at breaks out all over the skin, so that, as far as the
cohen can see, the person with tzara&#039;at has sores everywhere on his
body, from his head to his feet; then the cohen is to examine him, and if he
sees that the tzara&#039;at has covered his entire body, he is to pronounce
the person with the sores clean - it has all turned white, and he is clean.
But if one day inflamed flesh appears on him, he will be unclean. The cohen
will examine the inflamed flesh and declare him unclean; the inflamed flesh
is unclean; it is tzara&#039;at. However, if the inflamed flesh again turns
white, he is to come to the cohen. The cohen will examine him, and if he
sees that the sores have turned white, then the cohen is to declare clean
the person with the sores; he is clean. If a person has on his skin a boil
that heals in such a way that in place of the boil there is a white swelling
or a reddish-white bright spot, it is to be shown to the cohen. The cohen
is to examine it; if he sees that it appears to be more than skin-deep, and
its hair has turned white, then the cohen is to pronounce him unclean - the
disease of tzara&#039;at has broken out in the boil. But if the cohen looks
at it and doesn&#039;t see any white hairs in it, and it isn&#039;t more
than skin-deep but appears faded, the cohen is to isolate him for seven
days. If it spreads on the skin, the cohen is to declare him unclean; it is
the disease. But if the bright spot stays where it was and has not spread,
it is the scar of the boil; and the cohen is to declare him clean. Or if
someone has on his skin a burn caused by fire; and the inflamed flesh where
it was burned has become a bright spot, reddish-white or white, then the
cohen is to examine it; and if he sees that the hair in the bright spot has
turned white and that it appears to be deeper than the skin around it, it is
tzara&#039;at; it has broken out in the burn, and the cohen is to declare
him unclean; it is a sore from tzara&#039;at. But if the cohen examines it
and sees no white hair in the bright spot, and it is no lower than the skin
around it but looks faded, then the cohen is to isolate him for seven days.
On the seventh day the cohen is to examine him; if it has spread on the
skin, then the cohen is to declare him unclean; it is a sore from
tzara&#039;at. But if the bright spot stays where it was and has not
spread on the skin but appears faded, it is a swelling due to the burn; and
the cohen is to declare him clean; because it is only a scar from the burn.
If a man or woman has a sore on the head or a man in his beard, then the
cohen is to examine the sore; if he sees that it appears to be deeper than
the skin around it, with yellow, thin hair in it, then the cohen is to
declare him unclean; it is a crusted area, a tzara&#039;at of the head or
beard. If the cohen examines the diseased crusted area and sees that it
appears not to be deeper than the skin around it, and without any black hair
in it, then the cohen is to isolate for seven days the person with the
diseased crusted area. On the seventh day the cohen is to examine the sore,
and if he sees that the crusted area hasn&#039;t spread, that it has no
yellow hair in it, and that the crusted area is not deeper than the skin
around it; then the person is to be shaved, except for the crusted area
itself, and the cohen is to isolate him for seven more days. On the seventh
day the cohen is to examine the crusted area; and if he sees that the
crusted area has not spread on the skin and does not appear to be deeper
than the skin around it, then the cohen is to declare him clean; he is to
wash his clothes and be clean. But if the crusted area spreads after his
purification, then the cohen is to examine him; and if he sees that the
crusted area has spread on the skin, the cohen is not to look for yellow
hair; he is unclean. But if the crusted area&#039;s appearance doesn&#039;t
change, and black hair grows up in it, then the crusted area is healed; he
is clean; and the cohen is to declare him clean. If a man or woman has
bright spots on his skin, bright white spots; then the cohen is to examine
them. If he sees that the bright spots on the skin are dull white, it is
only a rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean. If a man&#039;s
hair has fallen from his scalp, he is bald; but he is clean. If his hair
has fallen off the front part of his head, he is forehead-bald; but he is
clean. But if on the bald scalp or forehead there is a reddish-white sore,
it is tzara&#039;at breaking out on his bald scalp or forehead. Then the
cohen is to examine him; if he sees that there is a reddish-white swelling
on his bald scalp or forehead, appearing like tzara&#039;at on the rest of
the body, he is a person with tzara&#039;at; he is unclean; the cohen must
declare him unclean; the sore is on his head. Everyone who has
tzara&#039;at sores is to wear torn clothes and unbound hair, cover his
upper lip and cry, &#039;Unclean! Unclean!&#039; As long as he has sores,
he will be unclean; since he is unclean, he must live in isolation; he must
live outside the camp. When tzara&#039;at infects an article of clothing,
whether it be a woolen or a linen garment, on the threads or the woven-in
parts of either linen or wool, or on a hide or item made of leather; then if
the stain on the garment, hide, threads, woven-in parts or leather item is
greenish or reddish, it is an infection of tzara&#039;at and is to be shown
to the cohen. The cohen is to examine the stain and isolate the article
that has the infection for seven days. On the seventh day he is to examine
the stain; if the stain has spread on the garment, threads, woven-in parts
or leather, whatever its use, the infection is a contagious tzara&#039;at;
the garment is unclean. He is to burn the garment, threads, woven-in parts
of either wool or linen, or item of leather having the infection; for it is
a contagious tzara&#039;at; it must be burned up completely. But if, when
the cohen examines it, he sees that the infection has not spread on the
garment or in the threads, woven-in parts or leather item, then the cohen is
to order that the article having the infection be washed and isolated for
seven more days. The cohen is to examine it after the stain has been
washed, and if he sees that the stain has not changed color, then, even
though the stain has not spread, it is unclean; you are to burn it up
completely - it is rotten, no matter whether the spot is on the outside or
on the inside. If the cohen examines it and sees that the stain has faded
after being washed, then he is to tear the stain out of the garment,
leather, threads or woven-in parts. If it appears again in the garment,
threads, woven-in parts or leather item, it is contagious, and you are to
burn up completely the article that had the stain. But if the infection is
gone from the garment, threads, woven-in parts or leather item that you
washed, then it is to be washed a second time, and it will be clean. This
is the law concerning infections of tzara&#039;at in a garment of wool or
linen, or in the threads or the woven-in parts, or in any leather item -
when to declare it clean and when to declare it unclean."</i>

<i>ADONAI said to Moshe, "This is to be the law concerning the person afflicted
with tzara&#039;at on the day of his purification. He is to be brought to
the cohen, and the cohen is to go outside the camp and examine him there. If
he sees that the tzara&#039;at sores have been healed in the afflicted
person, then the cohen will order that two living clean birds be taken for
the one to be purified, along with cedar-wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop
leaves. The cohen is to order one of the birds slaughtered in a clay pot
over running water. As for the live bird, he is to take it with the
cedar-wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop and dip them and the living bird in the
blood of the bird slaughtered over running water, and sprinkle the person to
be purified from the tzara&#039;at seven times. Next he is to set the live
bird free in an open field. He who is to be purified must wash his clothes,
shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water. Then he will be clean;
and after that, he may enter the camp; but he must live outside his tent for
seven days. On the seventh day he is to shave all the hair off his head,
also his beard and eyebrows- he must shave off all his hair; and he is to
wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; and he will be clean. On the
eighth day he is to take two male lambs without defect, one female lamb in
its first year without defect and six-and-a-half quarts of fine flour for a
grain offering, mixed with olive oil, and two-thirds of a pint of olive oil.
The cohen purifying him is to place the person being purified with these
items before ADONAI at the entrance to the tent of meeting. The cohen is to
take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering with the
two-thirds-pint of olive oil, then wave them as a wave offering before
ADONAI. He is to slaughter the male lamb at the place in the sanctuary for
slaughtering sin offerings and burnt offerings, because the guilt offering
belongs to the cohen, just like the sin offering; it is especially holy. The
cohen is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the
tip of the right ear of the person being purified, on the thumb of his right
hand and on the big toe of his right foot. Next, the cohen is to take some
of the two-thirds-pint of olive oil and pour it into the palm of his own
left hand, dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and
sprinkle from the oil with his finger seven times before ADONAI. Then the
cohen is to put some of the remaining oil in his hand on the tip of the
right ear of the person being purified, on the thumb of his right hand, on
the big toe of his right foot and on the blood of the guilt offering.
Finally, the cohen is to put the rest of the oil in his hand on the head of
the person being purified; and the cohen will make atonement for him before
ADONAI. The cohen is to offer the sin offering and make atonement for the
person being purified because of his uncleanness; afterwards, he is to
slaughter the burnt offering. The cohen is to offer the burnt offering and
the grain offering on the altar; thus the cohen will make atonement for him;
and he will be clean. If he is poor, so that he can&#039;t afford to do
otherwise, he is to take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved, to
make atonement for him; two quarts of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a
grain offering; two-thirds of a pint of olive oil; and two doves or two
young pigeons, such as he can afford, the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering. On the eighth day, he will bring them to the
cohen for his purification, to the entrance of the tent of meeting before
ADONAI. The cohen is to take the lamb of the guilt offering and the
two-thirds of a pint of olive oil and wave them as a wave offering before
ADONAI. He is to slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering; and the cohen is
to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the tip of the
right ear of the person being purified, on the thumb of his right hand and
on the big toe of his right foot. The cohen is to take some of the olive
oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand, and sprinkle with his
right hand some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before
ADONAI. The cohen is to put some of the oil in his hand on the tip of the
right ear of the person being purified, on the thumb of his right hand, on
the big toe of his right foot - in the same place as the blood of the guilt
offering. Finally, the cohen is to put the rest of the oil in his hand on
the head of the person being purified, to make atonement for him before
ADONAI. He is to offer one of the doves or young pigeons, such as the
person can afford, whatever his means suffice for - the one as a sin
offering and the other as a burnt offering - with the grain offering; thus
the cohen will make atonement before ADONAI for the person being purified.
Such is the law for the person who has tzara&#039;at sores if he cannot
afford the usual elements used for his purification. ADONAI said to Moshe
and Aharon, When you have entered the land of Kena&#039;an which I am giving
you as a possession, and I put an infection of tzara&#039;at in a house in
the land that you possess, then the owner of the house is to come and tell
the cohen, &#039;It seems to me that there may be an infection in the
house.&#039; The cohen is to order the house emptied before he goes in to
inspect the infection, so that everything in the house won&#039;t be made
unclean; afterwards, the cohen is to enter and inspect the house."</i>

<i>When you have entered the land of Kena&#039;an which I am giving you as a
possession, and I put an infection of tzara&#039;at in a house in the land
that you possess, then the owner of the house is to come and tell the cohen,
&#039;It seems to me that there may be an infection in the house. The cohen
is to order the house emptied before he goes in to inspect the infection, so
that everything in the house won&#039;t be made unclean; afterwards, the
cohen is to enter and inspect the house. He will examine the infection; and
if he sees that the infection is in the walls of the house, with greenish or
reddish depressions that seem to go in deeper than the surface of the wall,
he is to go out of the house to its door and seal up the house for seven
days. The cohen will come again on the seventh day and examine the house;
if he sees that the infection has spread over its walls, he is to order them
to remove the infected stones and throw them into some unclean place outside
the city. Next, he is to have the inside of the house thoroughly scraped,
and the scraped-off plaster is to be discarded outside the city in an
unclean place. Finally, other stones must be set in the place of the first
stones and other plaster used to replaster the house. If the infection
returns and breaks out in the house after the stones have been removed and
the house scraped and plastered; then the cohen is to enter and examine it.
If he sees that the infection has spread in the house, it is a contagious
tzara&#039;at in the house; it is unclean. He must break down the house and
take its stones, timber and plaster out of the city to an unclean place.
Moreover, whoever enters the house at any time while it is sealed up will be
unclean until evening. Whoever lies down or eats in the house must wash his
clothes. If the cohen enters, examines and sees that the infection has not
spread in the house since it was plastered; then he is to declare the house
clean; because the infection is cured. To purify the house, he is to take
two birds, cedar-wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop leaves. He is to slaughter
one of the birds in a clay pot over running water. He is to take the
cedar-wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird and dip them in
the blood of the slaughtered bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the
house seven times. He will purify the house with the blood of the bird, the
running water, the live bird, the cedar-wood, the hyssop and the scarlet
yarn. But he is to set the live bird free outside the city in an open
field; thus will he make atonement for the house; and it will be clean. Such

The discharge is unclean no matter whether it continues flowing or has
stopped; it is still his uncleanness. Every bed which the person with the
discharge lies on is unclean, and everything he sits on is unclean. Whoever
touches his bed is to wash his clothes and bathe himself in water; he will

for the community of the people of Isra&#039;el to prepare water for
purification from sin. The one who collected the ashes of the heifer is to
wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. For the people of

body it is, will be unclean for seven days. He must purify himself with

he does not purify himself the third and seventh days, he will not be clean.

purify himself has defiled the tabernacle of ADONAI. That person will be cut

law: when a person dies in a tent, everyone who enters the tent and
everything in the tent will be unclean for seven days. Every open container
without a cover closely attached is unclean. Also whoever is in an open
field and touches a corpse, whether of someone killed by a weapon or of
someone who died naturally, or the bone of a person, or a grave, will be
unclean for seven days. For the unclean person they are to take some of the
ashes of the animal burned up as a purification from sin and add them to
fresh water in a container. A clean person is to take a bunch of hyssop
leaves, dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the
containers, on the people who were there, and on the person who touched the
bone or the person killed or the one who died naturally or the grave. The
clean person will sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days.
On the seventh day he will purify him; then he will wash his clothes and
himself in water; and he will be clean at evening. The person who remains
unclean and does not purify himself will be cut off from the community
because he has defiled the sanctuary of ADONAI. The water for purification
has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean. This is to be a permanent
regulation for them. The person who sprinkles the water for purification is
to wash his clothes. Whoever touches the water for purification will be
unclean until evening. Anything the unclean person touches will be unclean,
and anyone who touches him will be unclean until evening."</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The concept of ritual cleanness (clean vs. unclean) originates early in the
Bible. Most of us have an intuitive sense of what it means to be clean
physically, but when something is called "clean" or "unclean" in the Bible,
there is usually a spiritual statement being made about it in that only what
God declares to be clean is fit to be brought into His presence. So, for
example, an unblemished lamb is still considered clean and was suitable for
sacrificial worship (under Moses) even if it had recently rolled in mud. A
pig, on the other hand, is unclean, and was unfit for sacrificial worship
even had it been scrupulously washed down with soap and water. According to
the Bible, things are intrinsically clean or unclean and, in addition, things
(and persons) that are otherwise ritually clean, can become unclean for a
time, according to where they have been, what they have done, or what they
have touched. So, for example, a man is intrinsically clean, becomes
temporarily unclean by touching a corpse, and returns to being clean at
nightfall. A pig, on the other hand, is intrinsically unclean and can never
be made clean.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The concept of ritual cleanness is also connected to holiness (spiritual
cleanness), and is exemplified by the fate of those who drank alcoholic
beverages in the tent of meeting; for we read in <u>Leviticus 10:9-10</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Don't drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor, neither you nor your
sons with you, when you enter the tent of meeting, so that you will not die.
This is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations, so that
you will distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean
and the clean</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Yeshua considered the distinction between clean and unclean to be important,
for he analogized it to holiness & wickedness in <u>Luke 11:37-42</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>As Yeshua spoke, a Parush asked him to eat dinner with him; so he went in
and took his place at the table; and the Parush was surprised that he didn't
begin by doing n'tilat yadayim before the meal. However, the Lord said to
him, "Now then, you P'rushim, you clean the outside of the cup and plate; but
inside, you are full of robbery and wickedness. Fools! Didn't the One who
made the outside make the inside too? Rather, give as alms what is inside,
and then everything will be clean for you! But woe to you P'rushim! You pay
your tithes of mint and rue and every garden herb, but you ignore justice and
the love of God. You have an obligation to do these things - but without
disregarding the others!</i>

Animals, objects, food, and even people are either clean or unclean and,
apart from their respective acceptability in temple worship, they sometimes
have an obvious connection to health as well. For example, <u>Leviticus
13</u> reads like a medical text on how to diagnose and treat leprosy, and
how to protect the population from its contagion. Some also try to make the
case that eating non-kosher animals such as pig is unhealthy, but I do not
attempt to make that case.

It is clear how all of the ritual cleanness regulations had literal
applicability in the time of Moses, but what about now? We have no Tabernacle
or Temple today, leprosy (looked at by most scholars today as skin infections
that include leprosy) is quickly and easily curable, and there is no
functioning Levitical priesthood today to enforce the Mosaic regulations.
Nevertheless, the laws of ritual cleanness serve to remind us that
maintaining our physical health is a godly value that we must pursue
rigorously.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is impossible to literally obey all of the ritual cleanness laws today.
There remains, however, an area of analogy to these laws, and that is to
conduct ourselves in such a way that we (both as Jews broadly and as Jewish
or Gentile disciples of Yeshua) who are believers are distinguishable from
those who are not. God also wants Jews to be distinguishable from non-Jews
because He gave Israel a commission to be a "kingdom of priests" to the other
nations of the world. God wants disciples of Yeshua to be distinguishable
because all disciples of Yeshua (Jewish and non-Jewish disciples alike) have
a responsibility to influence those who are not believers by what we say and
how we are observed to live our lives.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
For those of us that are Jews, we have a plethora of traditional practices to
draw from, many of which come directly from the biblical laws of ritual
cleanness. One that tops the list is that we do not eat anything that comes
from a pig. Two others are that we do not eat any land animal that does not
have a split hoof and does not chew its cud, and we do not eat anything from
the water that lacks fins and scales. There are, of course, other
characteristics that distinguish us as well, such as our keeping of the
Sabbath and the Appointed Times, wearing fringes with blue strands, and
tacking <i>m'zuzot</i> to the doorposts of our houses. Ritual purification
ceremonies survive today in the Orthodox Jewish practice of total immersion
in <i>mikvahs</i> (specially constructed baths of water), and in the washing
of the hands and fingers before and after meals (respectively), and at other
times prescribed by Rabbinical tradition. Common reasons for total immersion
are purification at the end of a woman's menstrual cycle, by a woman prior to
her wedding, and as part of conversion to Judaism.

For those of us that are believers but are not Jews, some (but not all) of

Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch chose a sampling of Scriptures about which to
write their <i>mitzvot</i> on ritual (ceremonial) cleanness, leaving many
unaddressed. Other than what is obvious when it pertains to leprosy, they
did not connect ritual cleanness to health, or separation of the Jewish
nation and, in their expositions of immersion, their emphases are more to
the physical than to the spiritual.
