<i>Yeshua was aware that the Father had put everything in his power, and that
he had come from God and was returning to God. So he rose from the table,
removed his outer garments and wrapped a towel around his waist. Then he
poured some water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the talmidim
and wipe them off with the towel wrapped around him. He came to Shim&#039;on
Kefa, who said to him, "Lord! You are washing my feet?" Yeshua answered him,
"You don&#039;t understand yet what I am doing, but in time you will
understand." "No!" said Kefa, "You will never wash my feet!" Yeshua
answered him, "If I don&#039;t wash you, you have no share with me."</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Scripture commands us to know God, but we cannot know Him without knowing
something about who He is. It is true of humans as well. We can know
everything about a person and still not know him because knowing a person
requires that there be a relationship; if there is none, then we do not
really know him. Scripture exhorts us to know God by having an intimate and
personal relationship with Him; for example:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>John 17:3</u>:&nbsp; <i>And eternal life is this: to know you, the one
true God, and him whom you sent, Yeshua the Messiah.</i>

<u>1 John 4:8</u>:&nbsp; <i>Those who do not love do not know God; because

</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Indeed, Scripture tells us that God is our heavenly father; but, do we relate
to Him as a father? One test is whether we relate to Him as we do (or should
do) our earthly father. We talk to our earthly father. Do we talk to God? We
listen when our earthly father speaks. Do we hear God when He talks to us?
Ideally, we love our earthly father (and mother) because they gave birth to
us and first loved us. God gave birth to us through His creation and <u>1
John 4:19</u> says:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>We ourselves love now because he loved us first.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Loving God is foundational to our having a personal relationship with Him,
and we cannot love God without knowing Him, and cannot know Him without
knowing who He is. How do we know who God (in fact any person) is? We have
to spend time with a person to know who he or she is, and it is no less true
of God. If this <i>Mitzvah</i> causes us to evaluate whether we spend enough
time with God to know who God is, then it has done its job.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is important that we know how to spend time with a God whom we cannot see.
First, we can converse with God. If we are a believer, we know that God
hears us when we speak to Him, but what is sometimes more challenging is
hearing Him when He speaks to us. For those of us that confess that we rarely
hear God or do not hear God at all, I would say that the first step in our
hearing Him is our believing that we can.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Our ability to know God through conversing with Him is a foundational
attribute and empowerment of the New Covenant; we read in <u>Jeremiah
31:32-33(33-34)</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>"For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra'el after
those days," says ADONAI: "I will put my Torah within them and write it on
their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will
any of them teach his fellow community member or his brother [to] 'Know
ADONAI'; for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
because I will forgive their wickednesses and remember their sins no
more."</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
God says that the New Covenant he will make with the Israelites will result
in everyone who is party to it knowing Him as Lord and, to achieve it, He
will put the <i>Torah</i> within each of us, and write it on each of our
hearts. I have no doubt that the Israelites of old who heard Jeremiah speak
his prophesy did not have a clear understanding of how God would bring it to
pass, but we now know that He did it by sending the Holy Spirit to indwell
those of us who receive him. For that reason, knowing God must involve the
Holy Spirit for, without the Holy Spirit, we are out of communication with
both Yeshua and the Father, and therefore out of communication with God.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
God has graciously provided us with help for our getting to know Him, and
that help is the Bible that tell us about Him - <i>ergo</i>, the Scriptures
quoted in this <i>Mitzvah</i> about knowing Him. We must keep in mind,
however, that knowing God (which is the goal) is different from knowing about
Him, but knowing about Him helps us to know Him. Here are two Scriptures
that exhort us to have knowledge about Him:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Ephesians 1:16-17</u>:&nbsp; <i>I have not stopped giving thanks for you.
In my prayers I keep asking the God of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, the
glorious Father, to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you
will have full knowledge of him.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Colossians 1:9-10</u>:&nbosp; <i>Therefore, from the day we heard of it,
we have not stopped praying for you, asking God to fill you with the
knowledge of his will in all the wisdom and understanding which the Spirit
gives; so that you may live lives worthy of the Lord and entirely pleasing to
him, being fruitful in every good work and multiplying in the full knowledge
of God.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
While these Scriptures exhort us to have knowledge of God, they do not
themselves give us that knowledge. I therefore refer the reader of this
<i>Mitzvah</i> to the above list of God's many attributes. The list tells us
who God is and, interestingly, most of the items on it tell us who we should
be as well. We achieve those attributes by putting off our old selves, and
modeling our new selves after Yeshua (<u>Ephesians 4:22-24</u>).

The <i>mitzvot</i> compiled by Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch command us to
believe in God, to love Him, worship Him, fear Him, cleave to Him and relate
to Him in other ways, but they do not address knowing Him.
