god; since ADONAI - whose very name is Jealous - is a jealous God. Do not

astray after their gods and sacrifice to their gods. Then they will invite
you to join them in eating their sacrifices, and you will take their
daughters as wives for your sons. Their daughters will prostitute themselves

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> prohibits us from deriving any benefit from idolatry.
This includes deriving benefit from objects of idolatry, from idolatry as a
practice, and from those who engage in it. We are prohibited from selling or
even possessing objects of idolatrous worship, and thereby benefitting from
their value and the intrinsic value of their material components. We are also
prohibited from benefitting in less obvious ways such as (I would argue)
employing idolaters to do for us on the <i>Shabbat</i>, that which we are
commanded to not do ourselves. It also prohibits us from benefitting from
idols that are not of the physical kind, but rather idols of the heart and
flesh such as pride, lust, self before God (and others), etc. There are
numerous ways that we might be able to (but must not) derive benefit from
such idols; an example would be compromising a moral biblical precept in
order to not lose a business opportunity (see <u>Matthew 6:24</u> and
<u>Colossians 3:5</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Idols of all kinds (including things of the occult) are associated with
demons and curses (see <u>Deuteronomy 7:26</u>), and we must therefore not
possess them, take them into our homes, or even touch them. It is a matter of
discernment, however, as to how direct the receiving of benefit from an idol
or idolatry must be, in order for it to be considered a violation of
Scripture. For example, is it permissible to eat food prepared by one you
suspect of being an idol worshiper? Suppose the restaurant one enters
exhibits a statue of Buddha or displays food sacrificed to the proprietor's
ancestors? Interestingly, Scripture allows Israelites to receive commercial
benefit from foreigners (most likely idolaters during the time of Moses) that
they cannot receive from fellow Jews. One such example is that all debts are
cancelled during the <i>sh'mittah</i> (sabbatical year) as to fellow Jews but
not as to foreigners (<u>Deuteronomy 15:1-3</u>). Therefore, if you loan to
a foreigner and the <i>sh'mittah</i> arrives, you can continue to collect
what you have loaned, whereas, if you loan to a Jew you cannot. Another
example is that, according to <u>Deuteronomy 23:21(20)</u>, a Jew can lend at
interest to an outsider (presumably even an idolater), whereas a loan to a
fellow Jew has to be interest-free.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Finally, note the similarity of <u>Acts 15:28-29</u> and <u>Deuteronomy
32:38</u> in their instruction to not eat or drink foods connected to idol
worship. They both prohibit the physical eating of such foods, but one might
perceive a broader and higher meaning from them, which is to abstain from
nourishing ourselves with anything related to idolatry.

Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch treat the subject of not benefiting from
idolatry as several <i>mitzvot</i>. They anticipate that some of the
prohibited benefits of idolatry could be (1) covenanting with idolaters for
any gainful purpose; (2) wearing items that have adorned an idol; (3)
obtaining a wife for one's son; and (4) profiting from the precious materials
of carved statues.
