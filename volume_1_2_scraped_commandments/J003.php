<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
"Damages" is that aspect of law that has to do with loss. If damage is to a
person, we call it "injury". Damages that are actionable (recoverable from
another) originate in either "tort" or "contract". A tort is a wrongful act
(intentional or unintentional) that infringes the rights of another and leads
to damages. An example of an intentional tort is assault, and of an
unintentional tort is negligence that causes damages. A contract is an
agreement between parties, and damages can result from a party either
intentionally or unintentionally failing to fulfill his or her part of the
agreement. An intentional bailment is usually a contract to place one's
property in the custody and care of another. A bailment can, however, come
about unintentionally, such as when one finds and takes temporary possession
lost property.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Depending on the circumstance of what causes damage or injury, appropriate
remedies can be restitution, paying compensatory money damages, paying
punitive damages (in the case of an intentional or reckless tort or gross
negligence), specific performance of a contract (a court order to perform a
contract as agreed), etc. What we are speaking of here are infractions of
civil law as distinguished from criminal law, but they sometimes overlap. An
example of overlap is theft. Theft is a civil offense to the victim who
incurs financial damage, and it is simultaneously a criminal offense to
society at large because of damage to the peace of the community. Bringing a
thief to justice can, therefore, involve making restitution to the person
from whom he stole, paying a fine to society, and also possibly a jail
sentence.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures listed above each speak to circumstances and conduct that can
and often do cause damages. The torts, contracts, and remedies illustrated by
the Scriptures are mere examples of others that exist, but they serve to make
the point. Some of them are geared more to the time of Moses than to today,
but similarities to modern situations can easily be seen, which is why our
contemporary laws have largely been derived from these ancient examples. In
today's urban society I do not have an ox to be gored by my neighbor's ox,
but I do have a car that could conceivably be gored by his car; it is the
same principle.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In order for a civil court to have the capacity to adjudicate a claim for
damages, it must have three kinds of jurisdiction - personal, territorial,
and subject matter. An ecclesiastical court (a Jewish court is called a
<i>bet din</i>) must have these as well, except that its territorial
jurisdiction is considered the entire world. Civil courts get their subject
matter jurisdiction from civil law (e.g. statutes, ordinances, case law,
etc.) and ecclesiastical courts get their subject matter jurisdiction from
the Bible. Personal jurisdiction is acquired in various ways. In the civil
courts it is sometimes acquired by the defendant's domicile, sometimes to
where the damages sued for occurred, and sometimes it is defined by statute.
Personal jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical court is a debated matter. It
should be over all believers in Yeshua if it is a church court, and over Jews
(Messianic or not Messianic) if it is a <i>bet din</i>. Sometimes, personal
jurisdiction is acquired by the defendant being a member of a congregation,
denomination, network of congregations, or organization. Plaintiffs are
automatically subject to the jurisdiction of whatever court they apply to for
relief.
