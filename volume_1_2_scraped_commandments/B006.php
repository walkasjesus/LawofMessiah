<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In ancient Israel, the life-sustaining commodities were foods grown in the
soil, typically grains and grapes. God's commandments to leave the gleanings
and reserve a part of the fields and vineyards for the poor and the foreigner
were part of His larger plan to provide for those who could not otherwise
live (e.g. <u>Ruth 2:2</u>). It is instructive that no such commandments
were given regarding herds, flocks, manufactured goods, and artisans'
services other than the left-over of certain animal offerings to be given to
the Levites. My conclusion, therefore, is that these commandments were not
intended to impute broad moral responsibility to the owners of all industries
and commodities; their purpose was solely <i>tz'dakah</i>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Although the Scriptures heretofore presented have diminished applicability in
today's industrial and technical world, they must be complied with literally
in agricultural environments where they can be applied. There are also wider
applications of the Scriptures that should be considered by those of us who
produce or provide life-sustaining (or even life-enhancing) products and
services of a non-agricultural nature, and are moved to comply with the
spirit of what God sought to achieve in ancient Israel. In such cases, part
of our production (be they goods or services) can be identified and set apart
as <i>tz'dakah</i> (over and above our other requirements to give
<i>tz'dakah</i>), and the items themselves or profits therefrom can be given
to the poor and
disadvantaged.<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>
Setting aside food and clothing in food banks and humanitarian aid centers is
very much in keeping with this concept, and a goodly number of synagogues and
churches participate in this kind of charitable giving.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Another opportunity for applying this <i>Mitzvah</i> occurs when we
inadvertently produce defective but usable products. When that happens,
instead of discarding them or selling them at a discount for our own gain, we
could donate the irregular items or the proceeds of their sale to the poor
and disadvantaged. Examples of such items are blemished fruits, irregularly
sewn garments, unevenly cut building materials, discolored fabrics, and
dented appliances.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The original agricultural commandments stand unchanged and are mandatory,
whereas this broader <i>mitzvah</i> is optional but recommended for prayerful
resolution.

In ancient Israel, foreigners were protected by
God&#039;s Commandments because they were disadvantaged, as were widows and
orphans.

Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch interpret the Scriptures of this

HaChinuck) considers them applicable only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
