<u>Genesis 2:18-24</u>

<i>ADONAI, God, said, "It isn&#039;t good that the person should be alone. I
will make for him a companion suitable for helping him." So from the ground
ADONAI, God, formed every wild animal and every bird that flies in the air,
and he brought them to the person to see what he would call them. Whatever
the person would call each living creature, that was to be its name. So the
person gave names to all the livestock, to the birds in the air and to every
wild animal. But for Adam there was not found a companion suitable for
helping him. Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the person; and
while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and closed up the place from
which he took it with flesh. The rib which ADONAI, God, had taken from the
person, he made a woman-person; and he brought her to the man-person. The
man-person said, "At last! This is bone from my bones and flesh from my
flesh. She is to be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man." This
is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his wife, and
they are to be one flesh.</i>

<i>Now if a man thinks he is behaving dishonorably by treating his
fianc&eacute;e this way, and if there is strong sexual desire, so that
marriage is what ought to happen; then let him do what he wants - he is not
sinning: let them get married. But if a man has firmly made up his mind,
being under no compulsion but having complete control over his will, if he
has decided within himself to keep his fianc&eacute;e a virgin, he will be
doing well. So the man who marries his fianc&eacute;e will do well, and the
man who doesn&#039;t marry will do better. A wife is bound to her husband
as long as he lives, but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she
wishes, provided he is a believer in the Lord. However, in my opinion, she
will be happier if she remains unmarried, and in saying this I think I have

<i>Wives should submit to their husbands as they do to the Lord; because the
husband is head of the wife, just as the Messiah, as head of the Messianic
Community, is himself the one who keeps the body safe. Just as the
Messianic Community submits to the Messiah, so also wives should submit to
their husbands in everything. As for husbands, love your wives, just as the
Messiah loved the Messianic Community, indeed, gave himself up on its
behalf, in order to set it apart for God, making it clean through immersion
in the mikveh, so to speak, in order to present the Messianic Community to
himself as a bride to be proud of, without a spot, wrinkle or any such
thing, but holy and without defect. This is how husbands ought to love
their wives - like their own bodies; for the man who loves his wife is
loving himself. Why, no one ever hated his own flesh! On the contrary, he
feeds it well and takes care of it, just as the Messiah does the Messianic
Community, because we are parts of his Body. "Therefore a man will leave his
father and mother and remain with his wife, and the two will become one."
There is profound truth hidden here, which I say concerns the Messiah and
the Messianic Community. However, the text also applies to each of you
individually: let each man love his wife as he does himself, and see that
the wife respects her husband.</i>

throws herself into her work. She sees that her business affairs go well;
her lamp stays lit at night. She puts her hands to the staff with the flax;
her fingers hold the spinning rod. She reaches out to embrace the poor and
opens her arms to the needy. When it snows, she has no fear for her
household; since all of them are doubly clothed. She makes her own quilts;
she is clothed in fine linen and purple. Her husband is known at the city
gates when he sits with the leaders of the land. She makes linen garments
and sells them; she supplies the merchants with sashes. Clothed with
strength and dignity, she can laugh at the days to come. When she opens her
mouth, she speaks wisely; on her tongue is loving instruction. She watches
how things go in her house, not eating the bread of idleness. Her children
arise; they make her happy; her husband too, as he praises her: "Many women
have done wonderful things, but you surpass them all!" Charm can lie,

<u>1 Corinthians 7:25-35</u>
<br>
<i>Now the question about the unmarried: I do not have a command from the Lord,
but I offer an opinion as one who by the Lord&#039;s mercy is worthy to be
trusted. I suppose that in a time of stress like the present it is good for
a person to stay as he is. That means that if a man has a wife, he should
not seek to be free of her; and if he is unmarried, he should not look for a
wife. But if you marry you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not
sin. It is just that those who get married will have the normal problems of
married life, and I would rather spare you. What I am saying, brothers, is
that there is not much time left: from now on a man with a wife should live
as if he had none - and those who are sad should live as if they
weren&#039;t, those who are happy as if they weren&#039;t, and those who
deal in worldly affairs as if not engrossed in them - because the present
scheme of things in this world won&#039;t last much longer. What I want is
for you to be free of concern. An unmarried man concerns himself with the
Lord&#039;s affairs, with how to please the Lord; but the married man
concerns himself with the world&#039;s affairs, with how to please his wife;
and he finds himself split. Likewise the woman who is no longer married or
the girl who has never been married concerns herself with the Lord&#039;s
affairs, with how to be holy both physically and spiritually; but the
married woman concerns herself with the world&#039;s affairs, with how to
please her husband. I am telling you this for your own benefit, not to put
restrictions on you - I am simply concerned that you live in a proper manner
and serve the Lord with undivided devotion.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> is derived primarily from <u>Genesis 2:24</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>This is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his

</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The resulting "one flesh" is what makes the leaving and cleaving covenantal,
and the fact that the commandment appears so early in <u>Genesis</u> is why I
call it a "creation" covenant (to distinguish it from other covenants that
came later). We commonly call this covenant "marriage".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
You will notice that several of the Scriptures from the <i>Tanakh</i> cited
above are labeled "obsolete". That is because circumstances and conditions
today are so different than during the time of Moses. Back then, the
Scriptures that are now obsolete made perfect sense and could be implemented,
while today they cannot.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Although this <i>Mitzvah</i> is expressed as a "man" leaving his parents to
join with his wife, the covenant of becoming "one flesh" cannot be fulfilled
unless the man's intended wife similarly leaves her parents. The "leaving"
of parents in the Scripture is not a reference to where the couple resides.
The Scripture is speaking of the controlling influence that parents rightly
have over their young unmarried children, but which is improper and
interfering if it is allowed to continue once the child (man or woman)
becomes married.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
I believe the reason <u>Genesis 2:24</u> reads the way it does, is that a
man's responsibility to leave his parents is different from a woman's. It is
the man's responsibility to take the initiative in leaving, but it is the
woman's parents' responsibility to release her to her intended husband. The
implication of her parents not doing so is, of course, obvious and, after
marriage, problems result when either or both of the marrieds allow improper
ties to their parents to continue.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The concept of becoming "one flesh" is not only covenantal, but also mystical
and difficult to comprehend. <u>Mark 10:8b</u> attempts to explain it by
stating:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">

profound truth hidden here, which I say concerns the Messiah and the

<u>Genesis 2:24</u> has been interpreted, in some quarters, as requiring
everyone to marry. I do not view it that way, especially in light of
Paul's remarks in <u>1 Corinthians 7:8, 32-35</u>. I believe that Scripture
teaches that the norm of creation is to marry and procreate, but it allows
for not doing so and, in some cases, singleness is God's will for an
individual (see <u>Matthew 19:12</u>).

This <i>Mitzvah</i> includes Scriptures that prohibit marriage to certain
persons. These include family members with whom we cannot have sexual
relations, persons with whom we are unequally yoked, Jews marrying persons of
certain nations, etc. It also includes persons that a <i>cohen</i> cannot
marry. Secular law also puts restrictions on marrying family members in order
to avoid weakening the human genetic pool and allowing unwanted recessive
traits to emerge.

</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch make no reference to <u>Genesis 2:24</u> (or
any other Scripture) to support leaving one's father and mother and becoming
one flesh with one's wife when one marries. Maimonides' RP213, Meir's MP44,
and HaChinuch's C552, rely on <u>Deuteronomy 24:1</u> to support their
allegation that marriage must be by <i>kiddushin</i> (consecration) - a
binding marriage ceremony. The Scripture does not say that, nor does any
other Scripture.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Maimonides and HaChinuch refer to <u>Exodus 21:11</u>, and Meir refers to
<u>Deuteronomy 24:1</u> to support their general law of marriage, but I find
all three commentators ambiguous as to whether their respective
<i>mitzvot</i> command marriage or simply describe the <i>kiddushin</i>
(sanctification), of a marriage ceremony. Apparently, Rabbi Dr. Charles B.
Chavel, a prominent translator into English of Maimonides' "<i>Sefer
HaMitzvot</i>" had the same concern, for he found it necessary to introduce
the bracketed word [only] in the first sentence of his <i>mitzvah</i> RP213,
causing it to read:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
By this injunction we are commanded to take a woman to wife [only] by a
binding ceremony: either by giving her something [of
value]<sup><small><a name=fr2 href=#fn2>2</a></small></sup>,
or by handing her a writ of marriage, or by intercourse [accompanied by a
declaration of marriage].
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Meir discusses <i>kiddushin</i> through the payment of monetary value, and he
also discusses betrothal before <i>nissuin</i> (consummation) but not the
other ways of consecrating a marriage.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
HaChinuch presents the most detail of <i>kiddushin</i>. He states that if
marriage is consecrated by the giving of monetary value, the groom must say:
"You are now consecrated to me by this money (or thing of monetary value)."
If the marriage is consecrated by a document, the groom must say: "You are
consecrated to me by this document (or whatever it is)." If marriage is
consecrated by sexual intercourse, he must say to his bride before witnesses:
"You are consecrated to me by this act of intimacy." He then takes his bride
into seclusion and is seen doing so by the witnesses.
</font></p><hr width=150px style="margin-left: 10px">
<p align=left style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=2>
<a name=fn2 href=#fr2>2.</a>
The modern equivalent of paying the bride money is for
the groom to give the bride a wedding ring of significant monetary value
while stating: "You are hereby consecrated to me with this ring, according
to the law of Moses and Israel." It is analogous to a "bride price"
practiced in certain other cultures, and opposite to a "dowry" which the
bride or the bride&#039;s father is expected to pay to the groom.
