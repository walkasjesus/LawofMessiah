<i>...you are to designate for yourselves cities that will be cities of refuge
for you, to which anyone who kills someone by mistake can flee. These
cities are to be a refuge for you from the dead person&#039;s next-of-kin,
who might otherwise avenge his kinsman&#039;s death by slaying the killer
prior to his standing trial before the community. In regard to the cities
you are to give, there are to be six cities of refuge for you. You are to
give three cities east of the Yarden and three cities in the land of
Kena&#039;an; they will be cities of refuge. These six cities will serve as
refuge for the people of Isra&#039;el, as well as for the foreigner and
resident alien with them; so that anyone who kills someone by mistake may
flee there. However, if he hits him with an iron implement and thus causes
his death, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death. Or if he
hits him with a stone in his hand big enough to kill someone, and he dies,
he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death. Or if he hits him with
a wood utensil in his hand capable of killing someone, and he dies, he is a
murderer; the murderer must be put to death. The next-of-kin avenger is to
put the murderer to death himself - upon meeting him, he is to put him to
death. Likewise, if he shoves him out of hatred; or intentionally throws
something at him, causing his death; or out of hostility strikes him with
his hand, so that he dies; then the one who struck him must be put to death;
he is a murderer; and the next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to
death upon meeting him. But suppose he shoves him suddenly, but without
hostility; or he throws something at him unintentionally; or, without seeing
him, being his enemy or seeking to harm him, he throws a stone big enough to
cause death; and the person dies. Then the community is to judge between
the one who struck him and the next-of-kin avenger in accordance with these
rules; and the community is to save the killer from the next-of-kin avenger.
The community is to return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and
he is to live there until the <i>cohen hagadol</i>, who was anointed with
the holy oil, dies. But if the killer ever goes beyond the limits of the
city of refuge he fled to, and the next-of-kin avenger finds him outside the
limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger kills the killer, he will not
be guilty of the man&#039;s blood; because he must stay in his city of
refuge until the death of the <i>cohen hagadol</i>. But after the death of
the <i>cohen hagadol</i> the killer may return to the land he owns. These
things shall constitute your standard for judgment through all your
generations, wherever you live. If anyone kills someone, the murderer is to
be put to death upon the testimony of witnesses; but the testimony of only
one witness will not suffice to cause a person to be put to death. Also,
you are not to accept a ransom in lieu of the life of a murderer condemned
to death; rather, he must be put to death. Likewise, you are not to accept
for someone who has fled to his city of refuge a ransom that would allow him
to return to his land before the death of the <i>cohen</i>. In this way you
will not defile the land in which you are living. For blood defiles the
land, and in this land no atonement can be made for the blood shed in it
except the blood of him who shed it. No, you are not to defile the land in
which you live and in which I live; for I, ADONAI, live among the people of
Isra&#039;el.</i>

your God is giving you to possess. Divide the territory of your land, which
ADONAI your God is having you inherit, into three parts; and prepare the
roads, so that any killer can flee to these cities. The killer who will live
if he flees there is someone who has killed his fellow member of the
community by mistake, who did not hate him in the past. An example would be
if a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood and takes a
stroke with the axe to fell a tree, but the head of the axe flies off the
handle, hits his neighbor and kills him. Then he is to flee to one of these
cities and live there. Otherwise the next-of-kin avenger, in the heat of
his anger, may pursue the killer, overtake him because the distance [to the
city of refuge] is long, and strike him dead - even though he didn&#039;t
deserve to die, inasmuch as he hadn&#039;t hated him in the past. This is
why I am ordering you to set aside for yourselves three cities. If ADONAI
your God expands your territory, as he swore to your ancestors that he
would, and gives you all the land he promised to give to your ancestors -
provided you keep and observe all these <i>mitzvot</i> I am giving you
today, loving ADONAI your God and always following his ways - then you are
to add three more cities for yourselves, besides these three; so that
innocent blood will not be shed in the land ADONAI your God is giving you as
an inheritance, and thus blood guilt be on you. However, if someone hates
his fellow member of the community, lies in wait for him, attacks him,
strikes him a death blow, and then flees into one of these cities; then the
leaders of his own town are to send and bring him back from there and hand
him over to the next-of-kin avenger, to be put to death. You are not to pity
him. Rather, you must put an end to the shedding of innocent blood in
Isra&#039;el. Then things will go well with you.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures that teach against murder appear to be of two kinds - the
majority of them speak only of killing the physical body, and a few of them
hint at a non-physical kind of murder - hostility in one's heart to one's
brother.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Of all the Scriptures on murder, <u>Exodus 20:13</u> is the most well-known
because it is among the "Ten Commandments". Murder (the intentional
unrighteous killing of a human being) is universally perceived to be wrong,
even by those who do not believe in God; it is what secularists may sometimes
call "natural law". God Himself does not kill with impunity either. He
values those whom He has created in His image and, when men do otherwise to
their fellow men with intention, God deems it evil as though they are seeking
to destroy God Himself. We see this clearly in <u>Genesis 9:6</u>, which
associates murder with destroying God's image; it reads:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Whoever sheds human blood, by a human being will his own blood be shed;
for God made human beings in his image.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Perhaps the same rationale explains <u>1 John 3:15</u> that extends the sin
of murder to hating one's brother, for it says:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no
murderer has eternal life in him.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Seeking to kill a man who is created in God's image is akin to coming against
God Himself, and is quite the opposite of receiving Him as Lord and Messiah
by which we are saved. In a similar way, <u>Matthew 5:22</u> states:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>But I tell you that anyone who nurses anger against his brother will be
subject to judgment; that whoever calls his brother, 'You good-for-nothing!'
will be brought before the Sanhedrin; that whoever says, 'Fool!' incurs the
penalty of burning in the fire of Gei-Hinnom!</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Murder, probably because of its permanently destructive nature, is presented
as the quintessential opposite of loving our neighbor for, as <u>Romans
13:10</u> states:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Love does not do harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fullness of
Torah.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In the Bible, the penalty for murder is always death. That notwithstanding,
the biblical law (similar to modern secular law) recognizes a category of
justifiable killing and also unjustifiable killing that is a lesser crime
than murder (terms used today are "murder in the second degree",
"manslaughter", "negligent homicide", etc.). Murder is ordinarily
distinguished from these lesser offenses by whether there was intention,
deliberation, premeditation, provocation, and malice. Examples of
justifiable killing are self-defense and killing in battle. Culpability in
the case of accidental killing has to do with whether or not negligence
contributed to the death.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Not precisely analogous but interestingly, whereas modern systems of justice
typically employ imprisonment as a penalty for these lesser categories of
homicide, the biblical law provides cities of refuge to which a man who has
killed another (excluding intentional murder) might flee to avoid being
seized upon and killed by the deceased's vengeful relatives.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<b><u>Daniel C. Juster</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Bible knows nothing of our modern justice system where so very many
crimes are punishable by jail time for the offender and often no restitution
in any real way for the victim. The <i>Torah</i>, instead, bases its justice
system on two categories. The first of them is capital crimes for which the
perpetrator is put to death. The second is all other crimes. For the latter,
there are penalties that both restore the offender and make restitution to
the offended. The community, under its judges (elders), oversees the
restitution process.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We may argue that capital punishment should be carried out in cases of
capital crimes committed in modern society, or we can argue that, due to the
difficulty of doing so and due to the many examples of false convictions
(although capital punishment is legitimate in principle and goes back to
Noah), life imprisonment is more appropriate and potentially more just.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Of course, biblical laws need to be updated for application in modern
society, but their principles still hold. Really, the prison system for
non-capital crimes is counter-productive compared to the biblical
prescriptions. In the Bible, one working off one's debt through indentured
slavery is merely a means for making restitution. In our age, the analogy
would be a judge attaching an employees' wages so that the garnished person
is in a partially parallel situation to the indentured slave whose slavery
lasts until the debt is paid off. Other crimes, like sexual intercourse
before marriage, are also dealt with by restitution, where the male subject
has to pay the bride price to the parents, and marry the woman if the father
so desires. I am aware that these remarks are gratuitously general, and
depart from the subject of this <i>Mitzvah</i> which is murder.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Even in the case of homicide, modern societies should consider replacing at
least a part of their justice systems that utilizes jail time, with methods
of procuring restitution for those injured (the families of the one killed in
the case of homicide). Where a person simply cannot abide by community
oversight and restitution or because he is criminally dangerous, then perhaps
jail is the only alternative, but it should be the last one considered.

<b><u>Classical Commentators</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Maimonides' <i>mitzvah</i> commands against murder (physical killing),
references <i><u>Sanhedrin 9</u></i> and <i><u>Makkoth 2</u></i>, and
prescribes death by beheading.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Meir prescribes beheading as well, but only if the murder is by the
perpetrator's own hand. If he only caused the death, he is not punishable by
a <i>bet din</i> but only by "Heaven's hands". Ironically, this may even be
the case if one pays another to commit murder. Meir also opines that if one
kills even a single Jewish person, it is as though he slew the entire world.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
HaChinuch begins with citing <u>Genesis 1:28</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>God blessed them: God said to them, 'Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth

living creature that crawls on the earth.'</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
He sees murder as violating God's plan that human beings multiply and settle
the world. He also cites <u>Proverbs 11:10</u> and <u>28:17</u> as
justification for executing murderers. As does Maimonides, HaChinuch
references <u><i>Sanhedrin 9</i></u> and <u><i>Makkoth 2</i></u>. None of
the commentators refer to <u>Genesis 9:6</u> or suggest a connection between
murder and God's image.
