<i>So God created humankind in his own image; in the image of God he created
him: male and female he created them. God blessed them: God said to them,
"Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in
the sea, the birds in the air and every living creature that crawls on the
earth." Then God said, "Here! Throughout the whole earth I am giving you as
food every seed-bearing plant and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. And
to every wild animal, bird in the air and creature crawling on the earth, in
which there is a living soul, I am giving as food every kind of green
plant." And that is how it was.</i>

sensible manager whose master puts him in charge of the household staff to
give them their share of food at the proper time? It will go well with that
servant if he is found doing his job when his master comes. Yes, I tell you
he will put him in charge of all he owns. But if that servant says to
himself, &#039;My master is taking his time coming,&#039; and starts
bullying the men- and women-servants, and eating and drinking, getting
drunk, then his master will come on a day when the servant isn&#039;t

cut him in two and put him with the disloyal. Now the servant who knew what

<b>A MANAGER'S QUESTIONABLE STEWARDSHIP OF WORLDLY WEALTH AS EVIDENCE OF HIS

<u>Luke 16:1-13</u>
<br>
<i>Speaking to the talmidim, Yeshua said: "There was a wealthy man who employed
a general manager. Charges were brought to him that his manager was
squandering his resources. So he summoned him and asked him, &#039;What is
this I hear about you? Turn in your accounts, for you can no longer be
manager.&#039; &#039;What am I to do?&#039; said the manager to himself.
&#039;My boss is firing me, I&#039;m not strong enough to dig ditches, and
I&#039;m ashamed to go begging. Aha! I know what I&#039;ll do - something
that will make people welcome me into their homes after I&#039;ve lost my
job here!&#039; So, after making appointments with each of his
employer&#039;s debtors, he said to the first, &#039;How much do you owe my
boss?&#039; Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,&#039; he replied.
&#039;Take your note back,&#039; he told him. &#039;Now, quickly! Sit down
and write one for four hundred!&#039; To the next he said, &#039;And you,
how much do you owe?&#039; &#039;A thousand bushels of wheat,&#039; he
replied. &#039;Take your note back and write one for eight hundred.&#039;
And the employer of this dishonest manager applauded him for acting so
shrewdly! For the worldly have more </i>sekhel<i> than those who have
received the light - in dealing with their own kind of people! Now what I
say to you is this: use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves, so
that when it gives out, you may be welcomed into the eternal home. Someone
who is trustworthy in a small matter is also trustworthy in large ones, and
someone who is dishonest in a small matter is also dishonest in large ones.
So if you haven&#039;t been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who is
going to trust you with the real thing? And if you haven&#039;t been
trustworthy with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what ought
to belong to you? No servant can be slave to two masters, for he will
either hate the first and love the second, or scorn the second and be loyal
to the first. You can&#039;t be a slave to both God and money."</i>

<br>
<i>So stay alert, because you know neither the day nor the hour. For it will
be like a man about to leave home for a while, who entrusted his possessions
to his servants. To one he gave five talents [equivalent to a hundred
years&#039; wages]; to another, two talents; and to another, one talent - to
each according to his ability. Then he left. The one who had received five
talents immediately went out, invested it and earned another five.
Similarly, the one given two earned another two. But the one given one
talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master&#039;s money.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned to settle accounts
with them. The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the
other five and said, &#039;Sir, you gave me five talents; here, I have made
five more.&#039; His master said to him, &#039;Excellent! You are a good
and trustworthy servant. You have been faithful with a small amount, so I
will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and join in your
master&#039;s happiness!&#039; Also the one who had received two came
forward and said, &#039;Sir, you gave me two talents; here, I have made two
more.&#039; His master said to him, &#039;Excellent! you are a good and
trustworthy servant. You have been faithful with a small amount, so I will
put you in charge of a large amount. Come and join in your master&#039;s
happiness!&#039; Now the one who had received one talent came forward and
said, &#039;I knew you were a hard man. You harvest where you didn&#039;t
plant and gather where you didn&#039;t sow seed. I was afraid, so I went
and hid your talent in the ground. Here! Take what belongs to you!&#039;
&#039;You wicked, lazy servant!&#039; said his master, &#039;So you knew,
did you, that I harvest where I haven&#039;t planted? and that I gather
where I didn&#039;t sow seed? Then you should have deposited my money with
the bankers, so that when I returned, I would at least have gotten back
interest with my capital! Take the talent from him and give it to the one
who has ten. For everyone who has something will be given more, so that he
will have more than enough; but from anyone who has nothing, even what he
does have will be taken away. As for this worthless servant, throw him out
in the dark, where people will wail and grind their teeth!&#039;</i>

A steward is someone who cares for things, and "stewardship" is the
conducting, overseeing, or managing of things. The "things" may be tangible
property, or intangible items such as time, knowledge, skill, etc. The
diverse Scriptures presented are representative of others and make a strong
case for God wanting us to be good stewards of the things He has entrusted to
us. They may belong to others, to God, or even to ourselves, but whether big
or small, God holds us accountable for those with which we have been
entrusted.
