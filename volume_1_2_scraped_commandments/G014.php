<br>
<i>What is revealed is God&#039;s anger from heaven against all the godlessness
and wickedness of <b>people who in their wickedness keep suppressing the
truth; because what is known about God is plain to them, since God has made
it plain to them. For ever since the creation of the universe his invisible
qualities - both his eternal power and his divine nature - have been clearly
seen, because they can be understood from what he has made. Therefore, they
have no excuse;</b> because, although they know who God is, they do not
glorify him as God or thank him. On the contrary, they have become futile in
their thinking; and their undiscerning hearts have become darkened.
Claiming to be wise, they have become fools! In fact, they have exchanged
the glory of the immortal God for mere images, like a mortal human being, or
like birds, animals or reptiles! This is why God has given them up to the
vileness of their hearts&#039; lusts, to the shameful misuse of each
other&#039;s bodies. They have exchanged the truth of God for falsehood, by
worshipping and serving created things, rather than the Creator - praised be
he forever. Amen. This is why God has given them up to degrading passions;
so that their women exchange natural sexual relations for unnatural; and
likewise the men, giving up natural relations with the opposite sex, burn
with passion for one another, men committing shameful acts with other men
and receiving in their own persons the penalty appropriate to their
perversion. In other words, since they have not considered God worth
knowing, God has given them up to worthless ways of thinking; so that they
do improper things. They are filled with every kind of wickedness, evil,
greed and vice; stuffed with jealousy, murder, quarrelling, dishonesty and
ill-will; they are gossips, slanderers, haters of God; they are insolent,
arrogant and boastful; they plan evil schemes; they disobey their parents;
they are brainless, faithless, heartless and ruthless. They know well enough
God&#039;s righteous decree that people who do such things deserve to die;
yet not only do they keep doing them, but they applaud others who do the
same.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Romans 1:19-20</u> says that godless and wicked people are without excuse
for not knowing God because God's qualities (His eternal power and divine
nature) are clearly seen in "what He has made". What He has made is another
way of saying His creation. I am assuming that no one reading this
<i>Mitzvah</i> is in the category of being godless and wicked or he would not
very likely be reading it, so I will address my following remarks to those
who are not yet convinced about God's existence, and to the rest of us who
already know Him, want more of Him, and aspire to His virtues.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Since what can be known about God (His existence and His nature) are there
for all to see by observing His creation, then we are remiss if we do not
seek to observe His creation at every opportunity. But how can <u>Romans
1:19-20</u> make such a sweeping statement - that everyone, everywhere, can
know about God merely by observing His creation? If we were to point to some
item of God's creation and ask a typical unbeliever to explain how it could
have come about without God, he would very likely respond with the Darwinism
he had been taught - that it came about from organic compounds in the oceans
that combined and, through natural selection, evolved to its present state.
Now to me, the logic of that happening is so implausible as to defy
imagination, but not to a person who has been taught that, and that has not
yet had a personal encounter with God.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
I would fare no better were I to show the unbeliever what the Bible says
about God because unbelievers do not believe the Bible either. Now the
negative picture I have painted does not mean that I should not try, because
(1) it is my obligation under the instruction of <u>Matthew 28:16-20</u>, and
(2) the Holy Spirit might anoint my words and make Himself known to the
unbeliever at that moment or thereafter, and that, of course, will make all
the difference. But whether I see it happen or not, I have an obligation to
bring the truth of God (including the salvation brought by Yeshua) to the
unbeliever at every opportunity. Although I cannot predict when God will
come to him, I can nevertheless bring him face-to-face with God through
speaking the words of Scripture, and through an effective presentation of
God's creation.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
But what is an effective presentation? I previously hypothesized an
unbeliever who rejected the idea of God's existence even after I showed him
something of God's creation and challenged him to explain by logic how it
could have come about without God. So, that is not the approach I recommend.
The approach I recommend is to show Him God's creation in nature, and draw
his attention to its goodness and beauty. Ask him: "Do you see beauty in
this tree?" "Do you see beauty in this other tree?" "Do you see beauty in
all of these trees?" How come? They are all shaped differently, yet they
are all picture-beautiful, and there is nothing about their beauty that has
anything to do with their survivability. The unbeliever will admit to seeing
beauty in the trees I show him because we, being part of God's creation and
having been made in His image, have an instinctive understanding of goodness
and beauty. There is no logic to it and there is no usefulness to it. Trees
would be just as functional in adding oxygen to the environment, just as
useful to nesting birds, and just as survivable in a forest crowded by other
trees, if they were ugly instead of beautiful. Darwin's theory of evolution
through natural selection does not explain why the natural world is filled
with beauty, and the truth of that will not be lost on the unbeliever.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
But we ought not to consider this <i>Mitzvah</i> to be only for the
unbeliever, because the rest of us (who already know Him) want to (and have a
need to) regularly encounter Him, and one of the ways is to observe and
contemplate what He has made - His creation, that God Himself said was very
good.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
You have no doubt noticed that, in speaking of God's creation, I have
associated goodness with beauty, and have shown you how relying on the beauty
of God's creation can impress an unbeliever and bring him to the place of
considering the existence of God and Messiah. <u>Genesis 1:1-31</u> says
that God saw, on five of the six days of creation, that what He had made was
"good," and the Hebrew words used for "good" in all five are "<i>ki-tov</i>".
Now although "<i>tov</i>" is very often translated as "good", it is not the
only possibility and, in fact the word (and concept of) "good" is quite hard
to define. What, for example comprises that which is good? The way
something looks? The way it feels? The way it tastes? The way it works?
When we consult the prestigious <u>Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew
Lexicon</u><sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>
for the definition of "<i>tov</i>", we get all of these possibilities: (1)
good; (2) pleasing; (3) delightful; (4) delicious; sweet or savory; (5) pure
and clean; (6) cheerful; (7) happy; (8) glad; (9) joyful; (10) kind; (11)
acceptable; (12) vigorous; (13) excellent; (14) fair; and (15) beautiful. It
is this last definition - "beautiful" - that I suggest is a better
translation of "<i>tov</i>" in <u>Genesis 1:1-31</u>, because then the verses
of <u>Genesis</u> read:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>On day 1</u> God created light, and "<i>God saw that the light was
beautiful.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>On day 2</u> God separated sky from water, and <u>on day 3</u> He created
land, the seas, grass, plants, fruit trees and seed-bearing fruit, and
"<i>God saw that it was beautiful.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>On day 4</u> God created day and night, seasons, days, years, the sun, the
moon and the stars, and "<i>God saw that it was beautiful.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>On day 5</u> God created swimming creatures, birds, sea creatures and
creeping creatures, all of which could reproduce, and "<i>God saw that it was
beautiful.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>On day 6</u> God created other living creatures, livestock, crawling
animals, wild beasts, and man, and "<i>God saw that it was beautiful.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Finally, at the end of day 6</u>, just before He rested on the
<i>Shabbat</i>, "<i>God saw everything that he had made, and indeed it was
very beautiful.</i>"
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Now perhaps you are thinking that substituting "beautiful" for "good" as a
translation of "<i>tov</i>" is forcing it to suit the purposes of this
<i>Mitzvah</i>. Not So! Here are three occurrences in <u>Genesis</u> where a
derivative of "<i>tov</i>" is translated as "beautiful" or "attractive" in
the NKJ, NIV, NAS, and yes, even in the Jewish Publication Society's
TNK.<sup><small><a name=fr2 href=#fn2>2</a></small></sup>
In the CJB:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Genesis 6:2</u>: "<i>... the sons of God saw that the daughters of men
were attractive</i>" The Hebrew word used for "attractive" is
"<i>ki-tovat</i>".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Genesis 24:16</u>: "<i>The girl was very beautiful,</i>" The Hebrew word
used for "beautiful" is "<i>tovat</i>".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Genesis 26:7</u>: "<i>After all, she is a beautiful woman.</i>" The
Hebrew word used for "beautiful" is "<i>ki-tovat</i>".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is similar in many other Scriptures; for example, in <u>Esther 1:11</u>,
the word for "beautiful" is "<i>ki-tovat</i>". In <u>Daniel 1:4</u>, it is
"<i>v'tovei</i>," in <u>1 Samuel 9:2</u> its first occurrence is
"<i>v'tov</i>," further in the verse it is "<i>tov</i>," and in <u>2 Samuel
11:2</u> the Hebrew word is "<i>tovat</i>". All variations of "<i>tov</i>",
and all translated "beautiful". If we use it in <u>Psalm 106:1</u>, we get:
