<u>Leviticus 23:9-21</u>

<br>
<i>ADONAI said to Moshe, "Tell the people of Isra&#039;el, &#039;After you
enter the land I am giving you and harvest its ripe crops, you are to bring
a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the cohen. He is to wave the
sheaf before ADONAI, so that you will be accepted; the cohen is to wave it
on the day after the Shabbat. On the day that you wave the sheaf, you are to
offer a male lamb without defect, in its first year, as a burnt offering for
ADONAI. Its grain offering is to be one gallon of fine flour mixed with
olive oil, an offering made by fire to ADONAI as a fragrant aroma; its drink
offering is to be of wine, one quart. You are not to eat bread, dried grain
or fresh grain until the day you bring the offering for your God; this is a
permanent regulation through all your generations, no matter where you live.
From the day after the day of rest - that is, from the day you bring the
sheaf for waving - you are to count seven full weeks, until the day after
the seventh week; you are to count fifty days; and then you are to present a
new grain offering to ADONAI. You must bring bread from your homes for
waving - two loaves made with one gallon of fine flour, baked with leaven -
as firstfruits for ADONAI. Along with the bread, present seven lambs
without defect one year old, one young bull and two rams; these will be a
burnt offering for ADONAI, with their grain and drink offerings, an offering
made by fire as a fragrant aroma for ADONAI. Offer one male goat as a sin
offering and two male lambs one year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings.
The cohen will wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave
offering before ADONAI, with the two lambs; these will be holy for ADONAI
for the cohen. On the same day, you are to call a holy convocation; do not
do any kind of ordinary work; this is a permanent regulation through all
your generations, no matter where you live."&#039;</i>

<i>The festival of Shavu&#039;ot arrived, and the believers all gathered
together in one place. Suddenly there came a sound from the sky like the
roar of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were
sitting. Then they saw what looked like tongues of fire, which separated
and came to rest on each one of them. They were all filled with the Ruach
HaKodesh and began to talk in different languages, as the Spirit enabled
them to speak. Now there were staying in Yerushalayim religious Jews from
every nation under heaven. When they heard this sound, a crowd gathered;
they were confused, because each one heard the believers speaking in his own
language. Totally amazed, they asked, "How is this possible? Aren&#039;t
all these people who are speaking from the Galil? How is it that we hear
them speaking in our native languages? We are Parthians, Medes, Elamites;
residents of Mesopotamia, Y&#039;hudah, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia,
Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome; Jews
by birth and proselytes; Jews from Crete and from Arabia ...! How is it that
we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great things God has
done?" Amazed and confused, they all went on asking each other, "What can
this mean?" But others made fun of them and said, "They&#039;ve just had
too much wine!" Then Kefa stood up with the Eleven and raised his voice to
address them: "You Judeans, and all of you staying here in Yerushalayim! Let
me tell you what this means! Listen carefully to me! "These people
aren&#039;t drunk, as you suppose- it&#039;s only nine in the morning. No,
this is what was spoken about through the prophet Yo&#039;el: &#039;ADONAI
says: "In the Last Days, I will pour out from my Spirit upon everyone. Your
sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old
men will dream dreams. Even on my slaves, both men and women, will I pour
out from my Spirit in those days; and they will prophesy. I will perform
miracles in the sky above and signs on the earth below- blood, fire and
thick smoke. The sun will become dark and the moon blood before the great
and fearful Day of ADONAI comes. And then, whoever calls on the name of
ADONAI will be saved."&#039;</i>

"<i>From the day after the day of rest - that is, from the day you bring the
sheaf for waving</i>" is the day we refer to as <i>Yom HaBikkurim</i> - Day
of Firstfruits (<u>Leviticus 23:10</u>). It is unique among the "designated
times" listed in <u>Leviticus 23</u>, in that it is the only one that is not
a Sabbath. The occurrence of the day we call <i>Shavuot</i> is determined by
counting from <i>Yom HaBikkurim</i>, and is unique among the Annual Sabbaths
in being the only one to which Scripture does not assign a particular date on
the lunar calendar; in that regard, it is similar to the weekly Sabbath. The
fifty-day count from "the day after the day of rest" (or Sabbath) in
<u>Leviticus 23:15-16</u> is known in Jewish practice as "counting the
<i>omer</i>", and which one of several possible Sabbaths is "day zero" of the
count, is a subject of ongoing debate. To add complication, <u>Numbers
28:26</u> calls <i>Shavu'ot</i> "<i>Yom HaBikkurim</i>" as well, the reason
being that there were two harvests involved.

Jewish orthodoxy has adopted the Pharisaic view that the count should start
from <i>Nisan</i> 16, the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, thus
causing <i>Shavuot</i> to always fall on the 6<sup><small>th</small></sup>
day of <i>Sivan</i>. By contrast, many in Messianic Judaism have adopted the
Sadducean view which is that the count should start on the day after the
Seventh-Day Sabbath that falls in the midst of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
This causes the count to begin on the first day of the week (a Sunday), on
<i>Yom HaBikkurim</i>, making this day the probable day of Yeshua's
resurrection. A result of this is that <i>Shavuot</i> falls on different
days of the lunar calendar in adjacent years, a consequence that seems to
have been intended in the <u>Leviticus 23</u> account.

When requiring that there be an animal sacrifice to accompany the grain
offering of <i>Shavuot</i>, Scripture assumes the existence of a Tabernacle
(or Temple) and an operating Levitical priesthood. Since we have neither
today, counting to <i>Shavu'ot</i> and waiving two loaves of bread in the
synagogue are correct adaptations of the Scripture, and are obligatory for
both Jews and <i>K'rov Yisrael</i> Gentiles. Gentiles of the Nations should
also keep track of the count because knowing when <i>Shavuot</i> occurs is
important for connecting them to the Jewish people, and for commemorating the
Holy Spirit's appearance in Jerusalem on the <i>Shavuot</i> following
Yeshua's resurrection (<u>Acts 2:1-21, 10:45</u>).

Maimonides analogizes the individual obligation to count the <i>omer</i> to
the <i>San Hedrin&#039;s</i> obligation to count the Years of Jubilee "year
by year and Sabbatical cycle by Sabbatical cycle." He also gives much
attention to justifying why counting fifty days and seven Sabbaths is one
<i>mitzvah</i> and not two, but makes no mention of when the count should
begin. Meir, in contrast, does not even mention that counting both days and
Sabbaths comprises one commandment, but specifically states that we are to
start to count the night of the sixteenth of <i>Nisan</i>, and that we are to
count while standing and accompany the count with a benediction. HaChinuch
states that we must count forty-nine days from the presentation of the sheaf
offering, which is the sixteenth of <i>Nisan</i>, and we must utter the day
count and the week count separately. He agrees that we are to do the count
while standing and with an accompanying benediction. Despite the different
way that HaChinuch expresses the number of days counted, all three
commentators endorse the Pharisaic way of counting - not the Sadducean way.
