<u>Deuteronomy 4:8-10</u>
(Meir MP14)
<br>
<i>What great nation is there that has laws and rulings as just as this entire
Torah which I am setting before you today? Only be careful, and watch
yourselves diligently as long as you live, so that you won&#039;t forget
what you saw with your own eyes, so that these things won&#039;t vanish from
your hearts. Rather, make them known to your children and grandchildren -
the day you stood before ADONAI your God at Horev, when ADONAI said to me,
&#039;Gather the people to me, and I will make them hear my very words, so
that they will learn to hold me in awe as long as they live on earth, and so
that they will teach their children.&#039;</i>

<i>Sh&#039;ma, Yisra&#039;el! ADONAI Eloheinu, ADONAI echad [Hear,
Isra&#039;el! ADONAI our God, ADONAI is one]; and you are to love ADONAI your
God with all your heart, all your being and all your resources. These words,
which I am ordering you today, are to be on your heart; and you are to teach
them carefully to your children. You are to talk about them when you sit at
home, when you are traveling on the road, when you lie down and when you get
up. Tie them on your hand as a sign, put them at the front of a headband
around your forehead, and write them on the door-frames of your house and on

<i>So if you listen carefully to my mitzvot which I am giving you today, to
love ADONAI your God and serve him with all your heart and all your being;
then, [says ADONAI,] &#039;I will give your land its rain at the right
seasons, including the early fall rains and the late spring rains; so that
you can gather in your wheat, new wine and olive oil; and I will give your
fields grass for your livestock; with the result that you will eat and be
satisfied.&#039; But be careful not to let yourselves be seduced, so that
you turn aside, serving other gods and worshipping them. If you do, the
anger of ADONAI will blaze up against you. He will shut up the sky, so that
there will be no rain. The ground will not yield its produce, and you will
quickly pass away from the good land ADONAI is giving you. Therefore, you
are to store up these words of mine in your heart and in all your being; tie
them on your hand as a sign; put them at the front of a headband around your
forehead; teach them carefully to your children, talking about them when you
sit at home, when you are traveling on the road, when you lie down and when
you get up; and write them on the door-frames of your house and on your
gates - so that you and your children will live long on the land ADONAI
swore to your ancestors that he would give them for as long as there is sky
above the earth.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
While the Scriptures cited here speak to all of the <i>Mitzvah's</i>
elements, the two that are primary are <u>Deuteronomy 6:6-7</u>, which is
part of the <i>Sh'ma</i> (the Scripture-prayer that is recited by Orthodox
Jews several times a day), and <u>Jeremiah 31:30-33(31-34)</u> (re-affirmed
in <u>Hebrews 8:10-11</u>), the prophecy that God would give Israel a New
Covenant, the essence of which would be God's Word (<i>Torah</i>) embedded in
hearts and minds so that all could know Him intimately. That prophecy was
fulfilled by Yeshua who, according to <u>John 1:1-14</u>, is God's Word made
flesh, and we know from other Scriptures that, after coming to earth, Yeshua
offered Himself up as a sacrifice for our sin, was resurrected from the dead,
and later returned to the Father, sending back to us the <i>Ruach
Hakodesh</i> to reside within all who are willing to receive Him. The
prophecy of Jeremiah was thus fulfilled, and we who are living today and
believe, are its beneficiaries.

The Scriptures cited do not use the word "study", but do say "on His
<i>Torah</i> they meditate day and night", and "meditate on it all day".
Also, the Bereans are said to have engaged in "checking the <i>Tanakh</i>
every day", all of which are tantamount to studying God's Word, but even
exceed mere study because they connote repetition.

According to <u>Jeremiah 31:32(33)</u> and <u>Hebrews 8:10</u>, God puts His
words within us but, just as with other blessings of God, He doesn't force
Himself on us; we have to invite Him. Therefore, we have a responsibility to
receive and internalize God's Word or we will derive no benefit from it.
Internalizing God's Word is the same as allowing the <i>Ruach HaKodesh</i> to
live within us, to counsel, comfort, and yes, even convict us of sin should
we stumble. Although Jeremiah spoke his prophecy to the Jewish people, God's
words

did not mean just Jews, but Gentiles also (<u>Romans 2:14-15a</u>) who, by
confessing Yeshua, are grafted into an olive tree among Jewish branches
(<u>Romans 11:17</u>), thereby becoming members in the "<i>national life of
Isra&#039;el</i>"<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>

Israel</i>",<sup><small><a name=fr2 href=#fn2>2</a></small></sup>

<u>Deuteronomy 6:7</u> commands us to talk about God's words (meaning His
words in Scripture), and it mentions four occasions in particular, which I
interpret to mean on all occasions. Speaking God's words has the benefit of
learning them, remembering them, and teaching them even to those who hear
them spoken in passing.

Teaching <i>Torah</i> and <i>Torah</i>-obedience is commanded (<u>Matthew
5:19</u>), and is expected of all of us. The <i>Mitzvah</i> as it applies to
our children is especially important, however, because teaching children is
the way our heritage of belief, obedience, and relationship with God is
passed from generation to generation. As <u>Proverbs 22:6</u> tells us:

Maimonides, Meir and HaChinuch wrote their respective <i>mitzvot</i> in
fairly literal ways. Maimonides' #RP11 speaks of studying the <i>Torah</i>,
while Meir's #MP14 and HaChinuch's #C419 emphasize learning and teaching.
Maimonides' #RP10 specifies that we are to read the <i>Sh'ma</i> twice daily,
morning and evening, and Meir's #MP11 says similarly that we are to recite
it. HaChinuch's #C420 says something quite different; he says that we are
only required to recite one verse of the <i>Torah</i>, namely <u>Deuteronomy
6:4</u>. I am of the opinion that the Orthodox interpretation of reading or
reciting the <i>Sh'ma</i> morning and evening is not what the Scripture
intends, but the practice is a good one and a valid implementation so long as
the Scripture's higher and more far-reaching message is understood and
pursued.
