<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Mercy and compassion are often referred to in the same Scripture, and the
various translations of the Bible sometimes do not agree on which of the
words should be used in a given verse. Although they are related to loving
our neighbor, mercy and compassion are not the same. Compassion is an
empathetic identification with a person's trial or difficulty, whereas mercy
is an action (or intentional inaction) of withholding harm from a person that
one is empowered to impart. It is ideal when mercy is driven by compassion,
but it is sometimes driven by other motivators as well, such as duty and
considerations of practicality. Sympathy is also referred to in Scripture,
but it is different in that it is more of a cognitive recognition of a
person's difficulty, that is not necessarily accompanied by an emotional
response.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Mercy and compassion are attributes of God, that God wants to be our
attributes as well. The reason that God can require them of us is that they
are part of creation - part of His having created us in His image. Whereas,
compassion comes upon us automatically, whether or not we extend mercy
requires that we decide based upon circumstances, and there are times (e.g.
when justice requires punishment) when it is right to withhold mercy even
while feeling compassion.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures presented herein are clear that it is God's will that we have
an attitude of mercy toward our neighbor, the reason being that God is
merciful toward us. Indeed, mercy is an attribute of God, for we read in

Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [[ADONAI]] is God, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger,
rich in grace and truth; showing grace to the thousandth generation,
forgiving offenses, crimes and sins; yet not exonerating the guilty, but
causing the negative effects of the parents' offenses to be experienced by
their children and grandchildren, and even by the third and fourth
generations.</i>
