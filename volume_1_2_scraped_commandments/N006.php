<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In ancient times, widows, orphans, and the poor were the principal
disadvantaged classes, so when we read commandments related to them, it is
fair to interpret them to include persons with other disadvantages and
weaknesses brought about by circumstance. Scripture is clear that God is
against anyone who exploits such persons or causes them harm. Indeed, they
are to be protected and ministered to so that they may overcome their
respective weaknesses or even be delivered from them. This is a proactive
responsibility related to loving the stranger, our neighbor and even our
enemy, helping our neighbor who is in need, and giving charity. It is not
sufficient to merely do them no harm; it is required that we seek to improve
their condition to the extent possible.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Deuteronomy 24:14</u> makes it clear that we are not to exploit a poor and
needy worker whether he is a brother or a stranger, and the examples of
Yeshua and His disciples are that they did not distinguish between brothers
and strangers in who they attempted to proactively help. As in the giving of
charity, the Holy Spirit must be consulted to determine the level of help
that is reasonable and required of us in each circumstance that comes to our
attention.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is important to keep in mind that exploitation is not just benefitting
from a person; it is deriving benefit from another unfairly by preying on his
weakness. Not only does Scripture demand that we not do this, but it requires
the opposite - that we seek to help disadvantaged persons and, to the extent
that we are able, give them relief from their disability.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
One can derive this <i>Mitzvah</i> by piecing together a number of the
classical ones, but the single closest classical <i>mitzvah</i> is
Maimonides' RN256 that prohibits our dealing harshly with widows and orphans.
HaChinuch's C65 terms it "afflicting", and Meir's MN51 terms it "inflicting
suffering". None of these deal explicitly with exploitation, and
<u>Deuteronomy 24:14</u> that does prohibit exploitation of the poor and
needy worker is not referenced by any of the classical commentators.
