cut it off and throw it away! Better that you should be maimed or crippled
and obtain eternal life than keep both hands or both feet and be thrown into
everlasting fire! And if your eye is a snare for you, gouge it out and
fling it away! Better that you should be one-eyed and obtain eternal life
than keep both eyes and be thrown into the fire of Gei-Hinnom.</i>

you should be lame but obtain eternal life, rather than keep both feet and

It is God's will that we remain in the world so that we can bear witness to
the lost - those who do not know God, and are in need of Messiah. We are
nevertheless warned of a danger to us, which is that if we are not on our
guard, we can allow ourselves to be ensnared by the things of the world that
appeal to our flesh, and backslide into sin. The things of which we must
beware are numerous - money, power, possessions, and illicit sex are but
examples. We are not, however, left to fend for ourselves, for the Holy
Spirit is with us, and we assured that:
