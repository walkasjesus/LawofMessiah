<u>Exodus 17:8-13</u>
(Maimonides RN59)
<br>
<i>Then &#039;Amalek came and fought with Isra&#039;el at Refidim. Moshe said
to Y&#039;hoshua, "Choose men for us, go out, and fight with &#039;Amalek.
Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with God&#039;s staff in my hand."
Y&#039;hoshua did as Moshe had told him and fought with &#039;Amalek. Then
Moshe, Aharon and Hur went up to the top of the hill. When Moshe raised his
hand, Isra&#039;el prevailed; but when he let it down, &#039;Amalek
prevailed. However, Moshe&#039;s hands grew heavy; so they took a stone and
put it under him, and he sat on it. Aharon and Hur held up his hands, the
one on the one side and the other on the other; so that his hands stayed
steady until sunset. Thus Y&#039;hoshua defeated &#039;Amalek, putting
their people to the sword.</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 6:24</u> and <u>Colossians 3:5</u> make it clear that Idolatry is
broader than just worshiping physical idols and foreign gods. An idol is
anything (or anyone) that we desire more strongly than we desire God, and
idolatry is any giving-in to such a desire, and putting that thing or person
ahead of God. Given that definition, what it means to practice idolatry or
entice others to idolatry is clear but, what is not as clear is what it means
to enable idolatry. That is more subtle and often goes unrecognized. We know
that a family member is addicted to alcohol, yet we allow him to store liquor
in the house. We have a listless son who will not work, yet we house him,
feed him, and lend him our car. Consciously enabling another to commit sin
(including idolatrous sin) makes us a participant, and as culpable as the one
who actually commits it.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The commandment in <u>Deuteronomy 7:2</u> to kill the heathen and show no
mercy was given in the context of Israel first entering the promised land and
God delivering the heathen of the land into their hands for destruction. Even
today, we should show limited mercy to the opponents of God if the mercy will
further their idolatry. To give a trivial opinion example, if a person drops
a stack of pamphlets that teach unbiblical practices, we should not assist
him in gathering them up. We cannot apply the Scripture to justify destroying
all heathens in these New Covenant times because that would be in violation
of <u>Leviticus 19:18</u> and <u>Matthew 22:39</u>, which require that we
love our neighbor, in violation of <u>Matthew 5:44</u>, which commands us to
love our enemies, and in violation of <u>1 Peter 2:13-14</u>, which commands
us to submit to human authorities. To destroy all idolaters today would also
be contrary to our New Covenant commission to carry God's Word to the sinners
of the world (<u>Mark 16:15</u>; <u>Luke 15:10</u>; <u>Romans 5:8</u>; <u>1
Timothy 1:15</u>).

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Now a word about <u>Exodus 23:33</u> that prohibits us from allowing
idolaters to dwell in our land lest their sin be a snare for us. As
individuals, we cannot control what is allowed in the Land of Israel, but we
do have control over who we allow to live in our houses and congregations.
This is not to say that we should not invite idolatrous sinners into our
dwelling places as guests for a time, for how else can we minister the Word
of God to them? Still, such persons should not be invited for an extended
period of time, or allowed to share occupancy with us as co-owners or
co-tenants.

This <i>Mitzvah</i> consolidates several <i>mitzvot</i> that were codified
separately by Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch. In his <i>mitzvah</i> to show
no mercy to idol-worshippers, Meir takes an exceptionally severe position by
saying that if we see an idol-worshipper drowning, we are not to save him,
and if we find him ill, we are not to cure him. He does not, however,
advocate precipitating a person's death merely because he is an
idol-worshipper. Maimonides treats this <i>mitzvah</i> in another way - as a
prohibition against extending grace to an idolater. He says, for example,
that we must not complement an idolater as being good-looking. A strange
example, but it makes the point.
