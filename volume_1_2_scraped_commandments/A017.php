there is someone more important than you who has been invited, the person

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are some words in the Scriptures supporting this <i>Mitzvah</i> that
are sufficiently similar as to warrant explanation. "Humility" and
"humbleness" are the same, and refer to persons who do not elevate themselves
in their own eyes. "Pride" is the opposite, in that a prideful person
attributes self-value, abilities, qualities, and virtues to himself, whereas,
even if they truly exist, they are not something he should be bragging about
because they were given to him by God. "Haughtiness" and "arrogance" are
similar, except that they refer to one's outward manifestation of pride,
whereas pride is largely internal.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The reason that humility is lauded and pride is hated by God, is that pride
is essentially a rejection of God, and is the sin that was behind Satan's
fall from grace. The sin of pride can manifest in several ways, the most
obvious of which results in brash boasting. Motivating such a person is often
the delusion that he is a "self-made man", forgetting or denying that God is
the one who made him, and made him what he is. The opposite, humility, gives
credit to God and also to others that have contributed to who we are, and
what we have become.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There is a more subtle way that pride can manifest. We sometimes come across
it in a person that has a sour and complaining disposition, even bordering on
self-deprecation. When we encounter it, we sometimes conclude that the
person has a low opinion of his self-worth, whereas it is exactly the
opposite. Instead of being boastful of his self-worth, such a person turns
inward and resents that others do not adequately see it. "I deserved to get
that job over my competitor" he might say to himself, or "they never give me
credit for how valuable I really am." He may withdraw from social
interactions by assuming in advance that he will be rejected, and may justify
it by saying to himself something like: "I'm worth more than the way they
treat me, so I won't give them the benefit and pleasure of what I have to
offer them."
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Perhaps I should not have to say this, but there is a way that we can
experience pride that is not sinful. It is when pleasure is evoked in us by
something of quality or by someone doing well, in which we have an interest.
An example would be expressing pride in one's son or daughter who is doing
well in school, or in one's hometown sports team that is winning most of its
games. We need to be careful, however, because even such innocuous
excursions into pride can cross the line of holy propriety if we begin
thinking that our child's or team's successes are mainly due to us.
