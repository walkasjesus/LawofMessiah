<i>"Here, the days are coming," says ADONAI, "when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Isra&#039;el and with the house of Y&#039;hudah. It will
not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by
their hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt; because they, for
their part, violated my covenant, even though I, for my part, was a husband
to them," says ADONAI. "For this is the covenant I will make with the house
of Isra&#039;el after those days," says ADONAI: "I will put my Torah within
them and write it on their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my
people. No longer will any of them teach his fellow community member or his
brother, &#039;Know ADONAI&#039;; for all will know me, from the least of
them to the greatest; because I will forgive their wickednesses and remember
their sins no more."</i>

heaven and earth pass away, not so much as a yud or a stroke will pass from
the Torah - not until everything that must happen has happened. So whoever
disobeys the least of these mitzvot and teaches others to do so will be
called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever obeys them and so

unless your righteousness is far greater than that of the Torah-teachers and

<i>For it is not merely the hearers of Torah whom God considers righteous;
rather, it is the doers of what Torah says who will be made righteous in
God&#039;s sight. For whenever Gentiles, who have no Torah, do naturally
what the Torah requires, then these, even though they don&#039;t have Torah,
for themselves are Torah! For their lives show that the conduct the Torah
dictates is written in their hearts. Their consciences also bear witness to
this, for their conflicting thoughts sometimes accuse them and sometimes
defend them on a day when God passes judgment on people&#039;s inmost
secrets. (According to the Good News as I proclaim it, he does this through
the Messiah Yeshua.)</i>

<i>Moreover, we know that whatever the Torah says, it says to those living
within the framework of the Torah, in order that every mouth may be stopped
and the whole world be shown to deserve God&#039;s adverse judgment. For in
his sight no one alive will be considered righteous on the ground of
legalistic observance of Torah commands, because what Torah really does is
show people how sinful they are. But now, quite apart from Torah,
God&#039;s way of making people righteous in his sight has been made clear -
although the Torah and the Prophets give their witness to it as well - and
it is a righteousness that comes from God, through the faithfulness of
Yeshua the Messiah, to all who continue trusting. For it makes no difference
whether one is a Jew or a Gentile, since all have sinned and come short of
earning God&#039;s praise.</i>

way provided by the Spirit and not in the old way of outwardly following the
letter of the law. Therefore, what are we to say? That the Torah is sinful?

would not have known what sin is. For example, I would not have become
conscious of what greed is if the Torah had not said, "Thou shalt not

<i>Therefore, there is no longer any condemnation awaiting those who are in
union with the Messiah Yeshua. Why? Because the Torah of the Spirit, which
produces this life in union with Messiah Yeshua, has set me free from the
"Torah" of sin and death. For what the Torah could not do by itself,
because it lacked the power to make the old nature cooperate, God did by
sending his own Son as a human being with a nature like our own sinful one
[but without sin]. God did this in order to deal with sin, and in so doing
he executed the punishment against sin in human nature, so that the just
requirement of the Torah might be fulfilled in us who do not run our lives
according to what our old nature wants but according to what the Spirit
wants. For those who identify with their old nature set their minds on the
things of the old nature, but those who identify with the Spirit set their
minds on the things of the Spirit.</i>

<br>
<i>So then, why the legal part of the Torah? It was added in order to create
transgressions, until the coming of the seed about whom the promise had been
made. Moreover, it was handed down through angels and a mediator. Now a
mediator implies more than one, but God is one. Does this mean that the
legal part of the Torah stands in opposition to God&#039;s promises? Heaven
forbid! For if the legal part of the Torah which God gave had had in itself
the power to give life, then righteousness really would have come by
legalistically following such a Torah. But instead, the Tanakh shuts up
everything under sin; so that what had been promised might be given, on the
basis of Yeshua the Messiah&#039;s trusting faithfulness, to those who
continue to be trustingly faithful. Now before the time for this trusting
faithfulness came, we were imprisoned in subjection to the system which
results from perverting the Torah into legalism, kept under guard until this
yet-to-come trusting faithfulness would be revealed. Accordingly, the Torah
functioned as a custodian until the Messiah came, so that we might be
declared righteous on the ground of trusting and being faithful. But now
that the time for this trusting faithfulness has come, we are no longer
under a custodian.</i>

<i>for everyone knows that our Lord arose out of Y&#039;hudah, and that Moshe
said nothing about this tribe when he spoke about cohanim. It becomes even
clearer if a "different kind of cohen", one like Malki-Tzedek, arises, one
who became a cohen not by virtue of a rule in the Torah concerning physical
descent, but by virtue of the power of an indestructible life. For it is
stated, "You are a cohen FOREVER, to be compared with Malki-Tzedek." Thus,
on the one hand, the earlier rule is set aside because of its weakness and
inefficacy (for the Torah did not bring anything to the goal); and, on the
other hand, a hope of something better is introduced, through which we are
drawing near to God. What is more, God swore an oath. For no oath was sworn
in connection with those who become cohanim now; but Yeshua became a cohen
by the oath which God swore when he said to him, "ADONAI has sworn and will
not change his mind, &#039;You are a cohen forever.&#039;" Also this shows

Torah on the basis of better promises. Indeed, if the first covenant had
not given ground for faultfinding, there would have been no need for a
second one. For God does find fault with the people when he says,
&#039;See! The days are coming,&#039; says ADONAI, &#039;when I will
establish over the house of Isra&#039;el and over the house of Y&#039;hudah
a new covenant. It will not be like the covenant which I made with their
fathers on the day when I took them by their hand and led them forth out of
the land of Egypt; because they, for their part, did not remain faithful to
my covenant; so I, for my part, stopped concerning myself with them,&#039;
says ADONAI. &#039;For this is the covenant which I will make with the
house of Isra&#039;el after those days,&#039; says ADONAI: &#039;I will put
my Torah in their minds and write it on their hearts; I will be their God,
and they will be my people. None of them will teach his fellow-citizen or
his brother, saying, "Know ADONAI!" For all will know me, from the least of
them to the greatest, because I will be merciful toward their wickednesses
and remember their sins no more.&#039; By using the term, "new", he has
made the first covenant "old"; and something being made old, something in

This <i>Mitzvah</i> was written to explain God's expectation of us in the New
Covenant, and how to apply His commandments today that were given under the
Mosaic Covenant. Although many Mosaic commandments are impossible or
imprudent to comply with literally today, <u>2 Timothy 3:16</u> assures us
that all of them are valuable in some way:

Today's conditions are changed. We no longer have the Tabernacle or Temple,
there is no longer a functioning Levitical priesthood or Levitical High
Priest and, even if we rebuilt the Temple and reinstalled Levitical priests,
most of the sacrifices required by the Mosaic Law would be unauthorized
because Yeshua is now our sacrifice for sin and our High Priest:

through which we are drawing near to God. What is more, God swore an oath.
For no oath was sworn in connection with those who become cohanim now; but
Yeshua became a cohen by the oath which God swore when he said to him,
"ADONAI has sworn and will not change his mind, &#039;You are a cohen
forever.&#039;" Also this shows how much better is the covenant of which
Yeshua has become guarantor. Moreover, the present cohanim are many in
number, because they are prevented by death from continuing in office. But
because he lives forever, his position as cohen does not pass on to someone
else; and consequently, he is totally able to deliver those who approach God
through him; since he is alive forever and thus forever able to intercede on
their behalf. This is the kind of cohen gadol that meets our need - holy,
without evil, without stain, set apart from sinners and raised higher than
the heavens; one who does not have the daily necessity, like the other
cohanim g&#039;dolim, of offering up sacrifices first for their own sins and
only then for those of the people; because he offered one sacrifice, once and
for all, by offering up himself.</i>

person who is righteous will attain life by trusting and being faithful.'

The Holy Tabernacle, the Temple, and other special places designated by God
were not only places in which to conduct sacrifices, but also where the glory
of God dwelt on earth, and where men (who were authorized) could encounter
God intimately and powerfully. <u>Chapters 40 to 48 of Ezekiel</u> prophesy
the detailed rebuilding of a Temple that is mysterious as to its identity,
function, and when it is to happen (or has happened). Some scholars believe
that the passage is a commandment for the Jewish people to rebuild God's
Temple. Most significant, however, is that the place where God chooses to
place his name is a foreshadowing of the New Covenant's visitation of the
Holy Spirit who has come to live within all men that are willing to receive

The above Scripture speaks of the ordination of Aaron and his sons as
Levitical priests, and Aaron as High Priest. A significant value of the
Scriptures concerning Levitical priests, is that they teach us what the
functions of a priest and priesthood should be and, although the Levitical
priesthood is no longer operative, other priesthoods are. The people of
Israel are said, in Scripture, to be a kingdom of priests
(<u>Exodus 19:6</u>). Also, <u>1 Peter 2:4-5</u> defines a priesthood of
believers in Yeshua, and <u>Hebrews 4:14-16</u> establishes Yeshua as the New
Covenant's High Priest. God has New Covenant priestly expectations of
Israelites (today referred to as Jews) and of all believers in Yeshua - not
to conduct sacrifices - but to prayerfully intercede for others, teach,
counsel, and otherwise serve our fellow man.

<u>Leviticus 24:19-20</u> declares that "eye for eye, tooth for tooth" is the
Mosaic standard of punishment for causing personal injury to another.
Expanding the principle to other kinds of infractions, one is reminded of a
quote from W.S. Gilbert's <u>The Mikado</u>: "Let the punishment fit the
crime." Sensible as these standards for punishment may seem, they are rarely
employed by today's secular governments that tend to not allow creative
discretion to judges.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures requiring execution and other extreme punishments of those who
violate certain biblical commandments are often shocking because, by today's
standards, many of the offenses that called for death and other severe
punishments during the time of Moses are not even considered crimes today. We
no longer stone our rebellious and drunkard sons, nor do we put to death
those who violate the Sabbath and, should we attempt to do so, we would be in
violation of the laws of the secular governments under which we live.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
During the time of Moses, the Israelites lived under a theocracy that was
governed directly by God and today, we do not. <i>Torah</i> for us today, is
ancient law that we read about in the Bible in order to understand its
principles. For the Israelites under Moses, however, it was contemporary law
that was spoken by God directly to them from Mount Sinai. For the Israelites
to disobey that which God commanded them in so personal a way would have been
a direct "slap in the face" of God, and worthy of the severe punishments that
we read about.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are also offenses in the <i>Torah</i> for which punishments are not
severe by today's standards, but which, nevertheless, cannot be applied
without transgressing today's secular laws. For example, <u>Exodus
22:2b-3(3b-4)</u> directs that a thief must pay double restitution for what
he has stolen, and he must be sold as a laborer (a slave) if he cannot afford
to pay. On the surface, double restitution seems fair and doable, but it is
not enforceable because the secular laws under which we live do not allow for
it, and slave labor is, of course, a violation of the secular law.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
For us, the main value of the various punishments we read about in the
Scriptures is that they give us an understanding of the seriousness with
which God considers certain kinds of wrongful conduct. In today's world,
capital punishment of a rebellious son would not be allowed. Yet, God
considers rebellion and stubbornness so serious a sin that we read in <u>1
Samuel 15:23</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>For rebellion is like the sin of sorcery, stubbornness like the crime of
idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of ADONAI, he too has rejected
you as king.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is also of interest to note that, except for captives in war, nothing in
the Mosaic Law authorizes imprisonment as a punishment; yet, imprisonment is
the principle form of punishment employed by secular governments today.
Really, imprisonment as a punishment is a blunt instrument because it does
not promote heart-felt repentance. For non-capital offenses, restoration
through community service and paying back offended persons (and then some) is
much more redemptive. What is more, being imprisoned with other offenders
often brings greater criminality that is acted out upon the prisoner's
release - the opposite of that which is intended. Societies should take this
into account in constructing their systems of law.

The Scriptures quoted could be complied with if one were a citizen of Israel
under Moses, but could not (and cannot) be complied with under other
governments. Still, they have teaching value. For example, the <u>Exodus</u>
Scripture teaches us that there is a government's need to know how many
residents occupy its country, and the <u>Deuteronomy</u> Scripture
establishes standards for judging legal cases, except that today, cases that
are removed from a lower court are sent to a higher court - not to Moses.

These standards are crucial for all societies. In addition, the idea of
witnesses, the rejection of trial by ordeal, and more, have informed Western
legal systems. That judges must not take bribes, but be scrupulously honest
and judge on the basis of at least two or three witnesses is also
foundational to courts. The rabbinic tradition also teaches that the
Noachide laws require Gentiles to establish fair courts in order to have a
positive destiny in the age to come. Finally, the idea that rulers are
subject to God's laws and are not a law unto themselves is a great principle
of Scripture that is enshrined in western law. The king can be called to
account by the prophet and is to make a copy of the Law and be subject to it:

This category "The Land of Ancient Israel" and the previously listed category
"The Government of Ancient Israel" are closely related, and many of the
Scriptures that pertain to one of them also pertain to the other. The modern
land of Israel (and its government) does not operate with a functioning
Levitical priesthood or Temple as in the past, and therefore certain

Nevertheless, the principles they teach are valuable today both in the Land
and in the diaspora, but they have to be applied utilizing the wisdom of the
Holy Spirit that is available to us through the New Covenant. Examples of how
we apply and practice such Scriptures today are found in the ways that Jews
of today keep the <i>Shabbat</i> and celebrate the feasts and other appointed

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
At the time of Moses, the commandments that pertained to ritual purity had to
do with being "clean" or "unclean" - not in the sense of being sanitary, but
for the purposes of being able to touch or be in the proximity of holy
objects or places. The cleanness of Human beings was the assumed norm, but
there were conditions and things that could render persons unclean and unable
to serve in the Tabernacle (later the Temple) and sometimes even unable to be
within the camp of Israel. Touching dead bodies, possessing weeping sores
(and other contagious conditions), giving birth, and a woman's menses are
some of the conditions.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Scholars disagree on the expectation of everyone living in ritual purity. For
example, a farmer is always touching dead animals and animal excrements. In
our opinion, being unclean for such reasons was expected and was not a
problem unless the unclean person was planning to go up to the Temple while
in that state.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Note also, that violating some of the laws of purity (e.g. disregarding the
holiness of blood and having sex during a woman's period) are beyond matters
of ritual purity, and required being cut off from one's people. Such
standards (without the penalty of being cut off) should be observed today.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In the New Covenant, being unclean always has to do with being in sin. For
example, <u>Matthew 5:23-24</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>So if you are offering your gift at the Temple altar and you remember
there that your brother has something against you [i.e. you sinned against
your brother], leave your gift where it is by the altar, and go, make peace
with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The assumption here is that you who are about to offer your gift at God's
altar, have committed sin against your brother, and need to repent to him in
order to be ritually clean. A similar requirement that one must be repentant
in order to be ritually clean is found in <u>1 Corinthians 11:26-29</u>;
referring to the <i>Shulchan Adonai</i> (Table of the Lord), we read:

Health-related Scriptures such as those exemplified above are
self-explanatory. In both the <i>Tanakh</i> and the New Testament, physical
disease is associated with men's sinful condition; in fact, in the Mosaic
Covenant, some of the functions of the Levitical <i>cohanim</i> were similar
to those of physicians and public health officers. Good hygiene and

The Mosaic Law not only permitted slavery - it regulated it. Slavery in
Scripture is not, however, the same as typically occurs in some secular
societies today, where certain people, for no fault of their own, are
kidnaped and enslaved or sold as slaves for personal gain:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Exodus 21:16</u>

</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
An Israelite or non-Israelite might become a slave for a number of reasons.
In the examples above, slavery that was procured by kidnaping was illegal and
was punishable by death, but slavery was also a means by which a person could
pay off a personal debt that he could not pay otherwise (<u>2 Kings 4:1</u>
supra). Slavery was also imposed on idolaters whose land was conquered by
Israel at God's command (<u>Deuteronomy 20:10-11</u> supra). Also, an
Israelite who burglarized and could not afford to pay back double could be
sold into slavery, and the value of his labor used to pay his debt (<u>Exodus
22:2b(3b)</u> supra). Israelite slaves would work for six years and be freed
automatically on the <i>Sh'mitah</i>, at which time his debt would be
forgiven (<u>Exodus 21:2</u>; <u>Deuteronomy 15:1-3</u>
supra);<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>
Slavery was, therefore, an ancient means of debt-collection that had an
escape clause for Israelites. Indentured servanthood was a kind of slavery
that was voluntarily entered into for a season, and there was another kind of
voluntary slavery that was permanent (see <u>Exodus 21:5-6</u> supra).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Unlike the Scriptures of the Mosaic Covenant, those of the New Covenant do
not seek to regulate slavery. They do, however, recognize its existence, and
instruct those who are subject to it, how to cope, while bringing glory to
God by maintaining a servant's heart.

The thrust of the New Covenant whereby the slave is considered equal in value
as his master who is to treat him as a brother, eventually led to the
perception among believers in Yeshua, that slavery was incompatible with
there being a brotherhood of believers. Thus slavery fell into disuse in the
believing communities of the first century. Today, slavery is outlawed in
the western countries, but the Scriptures about slavery are, nevertheless,
still useful in teaching us how to selflessly serve God, how to give godly
service to others, and how to compassionately treat and respect those who
give service to us.

<i>ADONAI spoke to Moshe on Mount Sinai; he said, 'Tell the people of

observe a Shabbat rest for ADONAI. Six years you will sow your field; six
years you will prune your grapevines and gather their produce. But in the
seventh year is to be a Shabbat of complete rest for the land, a Shabbat for
ADONAI; you will neither sow your field nor prune your grapevines. You are
not to harvest what grows by itself from the seeds left by your previous
harvest, and you are not to gather the grapes of your untended vine; it is to
be a year of complete rest for the land. But what the land produces during
the year of Shabbat will be food for all of you- you, your servant, your
maid, your employee, anyone living near you, your livestock and the wild
animals on your land; everything the land produces may be used for food. You
are to count seven Shabbats of years, seven times seven years, that is,
forty-nine years. Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, on
Yom-Kippur, you are to sound a blast on the shofar; you are to sound the
shofar all through your land; and you are to consecrate the fiftieth year,
proclaiming freedom throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It will be a
yovel for you; you will return everyone to the land he owns, and everyone is
to return to his family. That fiftieth year will be a yovel for you; in that
year you are not to sow, harvest what grows by itself or gather the grapes of
untended vines; because it is a yovel. It will be holy for you; whatever the
fields produce will be food for all of you. In this year of yovel, every one
of you is to return to the land he owns. If you sell anything to your
neighbor or buy anything from him, neither of you is to exploit the other.
Rather, you are to take into account the number of years after the yovel when
you buy land from your neighbor, and he is to sell to you according to the
number of years crops will be raised. If the number of years remaining is
large, you will raise the price; if few years remain, you will lower it;
because what he is really selling you is the number of crops to be produced.
Thus you are not to take advantage of each other, but you are to fear your
God; for I am ADONAI your God. Rather, you are to keep my regulations and
rulings and act accordingly. If you do, you will live securely in the land.
The land will yield its produce, you will eat until you have enough, and you
will live there securely. If you ask, "If we aren't allowed to sow seed or
harvest what our land produces, what are we going to eat the seventh year?"
then I will order my blessing on you during the sixth year, so that the land
brings forth enough produce for all three years. The eighth year you will
sow seed but eat the the old, stored produce until the ninth year; that is,
until the produce of the eighth year comes in, you will eat the old, stored
food. The land is not to be sold in perpetuity, because the land belongs to

debts to others be forgiven us. We can give rest to land that we own or
control in the <i>sh'mitah</i> or the <i>yovel</i>, but we cannot (especially
in the diaspora) return our land to its original owners in the <i>yovel</i>.

The <i>sh'mitah</i> and the <i>yovel</i> were provided by God as a hedge
against the social and economic injustice to persons who have become indebted
in a society that does not provide them the opportunity to extricate
themselves. The forgiveness of debts, the freeing of slaves, and the return
of land to its original owners, are a great equalizer of men, a promoter of
social and economic justice, and a reminder that it is God and not we who
ultimately owns all.

The biblical principle of forgiveness of debts in the sabbatical year slowly
found their way into Anglo-American law. In the middle ages in England,
debtors were bonded to their creditors similar to indenture in the Bible, but
with no escape in the seventh year. Imprisonment for debtors was also
employed as a means of coercing family members to pay for a debtor's release.
Then, in 1705, the "Bankrupts Act" was enacted in England, that empowered the
Lord Chancellor to release debtors from their financial obligations once
their assets were accounted for and appropriately distributed to their
creditors. This eventually developed into modern bankruptcy law that, in the
United States today, allows insolvent debtors to be discharged from their
debts every six years, analogous to the biblical discharge every sabbatical
year.

The section "Scriptures that pertain to criminal justice" overlaps the
section "Scriptures that call for punishment". There are behaviors considered
criminal under Mosaic Law and not by our contemporary laws, and vice-versa.
There are also behaviors that are considered criminal under both but, even
when it is criminal under both, the law it offends is not the same because
the governments behind the laws are not the same. The way that we of the New

should be applied to them. We read in <u>Romans 13:1-5</u>:

like to be unafraid of the person in authority? Then simply do what is good,
and you will win his approval; for he is God's servant, there for your

<i>If a person causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over or lets his
animal loose to graze in someone else's field, he is to make restitution from
the best produce of his own field and vineyard. If a fire is started and
spreads to thorns, so that stacked grain, standing grain or a field is
destroyed, the person who lit it must make restitution. If a person entrusts
a neighbor with money or goods, and they are stolen from the trustee's house,
then, if the thief is found, he must pay double. But if the thief is not
found, then the trustee must state before God that he did not take the
person's goods himself. In every case of dispute over ownership, whether of
an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any missing property, where one person
says, 'This is mine,' both parties are to come before God; and the one whom
God condemns must pay the other one double. If a person trusts a neighbor to
look after a donkey, ox, sheep or any animal, and it dies, is injured or is
driven away unseen, then the neighbor's oath before ADONAI that he has not
taken the goods will settle the matter between them - the owner is to accept
it without the neighbor's making restitution. But if it was stolen from the
neighbor, he must make restitution to the owner. If it was torn to pieces by
an animal, the neighbor must bring it as evidence, and then he doesn't need
to make good the loss. If someone borrows something from his neighbor, and
it gets injured or dies with the owner not present, he must make restitution.
If the owner was present, he need not make good the loss. If the owner hired
it out, the loss is covered by the hiring fee.</i>

Much that has been said regarding the Mosaic criminal law is the same for the
Mosaic civil law in that they are both promulgated by, and enforced pursuant
to, the ancient government of Israel that no longer exists. By the term
"civil law", we do not mean law promulgated by civil authorities since that
is true of criminal law as well. The difference between criminal and civil
law is that offenses of civil law are against individuals, whereas violations
of criminal law are deemed to be against society as a whole. We normally
associate violations of criminal law with punishment, and violations of civil
law with restitution, and damages having to be paid to individuals who have
been harmed. Sometimes the same wrongful act violates both a criminal and a
civil statute, such as in the case of an unjustified physical assault. An
assault against an individual is a breach of the peace against society as a
whole, but it also causes injury to the person who is assaulted;
consequently, both punishment and monetary damages to the injured party is
commonly required. As has been said regarding the Mosaic criminal law, the
way that we of the New Covenant should view it, is that it gives us God's
view of the seriousness of certain kinds of wrongful behaviors, and the kinds
of restitution that should be required for transgressing. <u>Romans
13:7-10</u> expresses the New Covenant concept of civil law best; it states:

you incompetent to judge these minor matters? Don't you know that we will
judge angels, not to mention affairs of everyday life? So if you require
judgments about matters of everyday life, why do you put them in front of men
who have no standing in the Messianic Community? I say, shame on you! Can it
be that there isn't one person among you wise enough to be able to settle a
dispute between brothers? Instead, a brother brings a lawsuit against
another brother, and that before unbelievers! Actually, if you are bringing
awsuits against each other, it is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be
wronged? Why not rather be cheated?</i>

When we do bring complaints against brother believers in the New Covenant,
there is a prescribed way of going about it.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
1. <u>Deciding Whether to Overlook an Offense</u>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Even when we are authorized to seek redress for a sin committed against us,
we need not do so.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Proverbs 19:11</u>
<br>
<i>People with good sense are slow to anger, and it is their glory to
overlook an offense.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Some offenses are easily overlooked - especially those that are
unintentional, have done no great harm, and are unlikely to be repeated.
Although it may seem that overlooking an offense is always the loving thing
to do, it is not necessarily so. One's decision should always be based upon
what is best for the offender, and what is best for others against whom the
offender may sin if he is not made accountable. If, however, the offense is
overlooked, it must not be brought up again unless the offense is repeated.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
2. <u>Bringing Correction to an Offending Brother</u>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
If our decision is to not overlook the offense, we must confront the
offending brother privately:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 18:15</u>
<br>
<i>Moreover, if your brother commits a sin against you, go and show him his
fault - but privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you,
you have won back your brother.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Galatians 6:1-2</u>
<br>
<i>Brothers, suppose someone is caught doing something wrong. You who have
the Spirit should set him right, but in a spirit of humility, keeping an eye
on yourselves so that you won't be tempted too. Bear one another's burdens -
in this way you will be fulfilling the Torah's true meaning, which the
Messiah upholds.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are three things in the foregoing Scriptures which stand out. First,
when we go to our brother to tell him his fault, our attitude must be pure
and our demeanor proper. The operative expression in the <u>Galatians</u>
Scripture is "a spirit of gentleness".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Second, we are to go to our brother alone. That means we are not to share our
complaint with others before first giving our brother the opportunity to
repent and make things right. This principle assumes two things: (1) The
parties are relatively equal in their ability to deal with one another, and
(2) There is no impropriety in the parties meeting privately. An example of
inequality would be a child having to confront an adult; an example of
improper privacy would be a male and female meeting alone to confront one
another concerning sexual sin. In these and similar cases, the Scriptures
should be interpreted broadly enough to permit chaperoning and for allowing
the weaker of the two adversaries to be accompanied by a suitable protector
but not an advocate or spokesperson.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Third, our purpose for confronting our brother must be to restore him to
righteousness, and our hope must be for reconciliation.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
3. <u>Returning with Witnesses</u>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
If the offending brother agrees with our complaint and repents, the matter
is, of course, concluded, and we forgive him. If he does not agree or
refuses to meet privately, we must then elect whether to pursue the matter
further, or to belatedly overlook his sin (<u>Proverbs 19:11</u>) while being
content that we have complied with <u>Galatians 6:1-2</u>. Although
overlooking the sin at this point is possible, its appropriateness is
unlikely. If there remains un-reconciliation, we are obligated to go to our
brother again, and this time, bring one or two witnesses:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 18:16</u>
<br>
<i>If he doesn't listen, take one or two others with you so that every
accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
These need not be witnesses to the original offense complained of (although
they may be), but rather to this second meeting with our brother.<sup><small><a name=fr4 href=#fn4>4</a></small></sup>
Our usual concept of witnesses is that they are silent observers. In this
case, however, the verse of Scripture that follows (<u>Matthew 18:17</u>),
infers that these witnesses determine which of the parties to the dispute is
wrong, and urges that person to listen to reason and repent. These verses of
Scripture are constructed with the assumption that the brother receiving the
visit is the one who is in the wrong but, in our interpretation, we allow for
the possibility that, after hearing the dialog between the brothers, the
witnesses conclude that the brother bringing the complaint is the one who is
in the wrong.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
As before, if the parties come to agreement during the visit or the offending
brother repents, the matter is concluded. If however, the attempt at
reconciliation is unsuccessful, the matter must not be allowed to fester,
and must therefore be brought for adjudication to the <i>ekklesia</i>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
4. <u>Bringing the Dispute to the <i>Ekklesia</i></u>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 18:17</u>
<br>
<i>If he refuses to hear them, tell the congregation; and if he refuses to
listen even to the congregation, treat him as you would a pagan or a
tax-collector.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The word "congregation" in the CJB (translated "church" in the NKJ) is
<img src=images/N005.gif align=top> (<i>ekklesia</i>), in the Greek text,
which means "a gathering", "an assembly (for worship)", "a deliberative
council". According to <u>Matthew 18:17</u>, if the complainant and the
witnesses are unsuccessful in convincing the offender to repent, the matter
is to be brought to the <i>ekklesia</i> for adjudication.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Since the entire <i>ekklesia</i> (the body of believers or even the
membership of a single congregation) is too large a group to assemble in
order to hear and judge disputes, it is the prevailing view that a <i>bet
din</i> (ecclesiastical court) of assembled elders acts for the
<i>ekklesia</i> and rules on the complaint brought before it. If, after
announcing its judgment, the person ruled to be in the wrong does not repent,
we are to treat him as we would "<i>a pagan or a tax-collector</i>"
(<u>Matthew 18:17</u>). This is sometimes referred to as a decree of
"disfellowship" or "excommunication".
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
It is a common misunderstanding that when a brother is excommunicated
pursuant to <u>Matthew 18:17</u>, he must necessarily be ejected from the
congregation. On the contrary, after a judgment of excommunication, the
brother must be treated as an unbeliever in every way. Therefore, although
he must be refused holy communion (<i>Shulchan Adonai</i>) with the brethren,
unless he is also a violator of <u>1 Corinthians 5:9-13</u> (walking in
immorality while calling himself a believer) or <u>Titus 3:10-11</u>
(divisive or otherwise harmful to the body), he should be encouraged to
attend congregational services and other events where he is likely to hear
the Word of God and be encouraged to repent.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
One interesting consequence of a <u>Matthew 18:17</u> excommunication, is
that the complainant is released from the constraint of <u>1 Corinthians
6:1-7</u>, and is free to sue the unrepentant "former" brother in a secular
court. This has special ramifications for persons seeking to divorce an
excommunicated spouse.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Another common misunderstanding is that a decree of excommunication applies
only to the excommunicating congregation or religious denomination.
Biblically, that is not so. Judgments arising from <u>Matthew 18</u>
proceedings apply across the entire body of believers and, so long as correct
biblical doctrine is applied and due process is afforded, congregations of
all stripes are biblically required to recognize the judgment. What is more,
God Himself recognizes and honors the judgment, for we read in <u>Matthew
18:18</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Yes! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth will be
prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in
heaven.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We note that sins without repentance that would lead to capital punishment
in the Mosaic order generally require disfellowship in the New Covenant
order.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
5. <u>Restoring a Brother to Fellowship</u>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
A <u>Matthew 18</u> judgment of "disfellowship" is reversible in the same way
as the status of being an unbeliever is reversible. What is required is that
the sanctioned brother repent of his former sin, comply with all orders of
the convicting <i>bet din</i>, and receive Yeshua again as his Lord and
savior. Ideally, the same <i>bet din</i> that ruled previously is convened to
judge the repentance and, if the repentance is deemed genuine, the tribunal
should set aside its prior judgment, and publish a decree of restoration.
This restoration which is bound on earth, is also bound in heaven (<u>Matthew
18:18</u>).

6. <u>When the Offender is Us!</u>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">

<u>Matthew 5:23-24</u>
<br>
<i>So if you are offering your gift at the Temple altar and you remember

offer your gift.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This is the reciprocal of the situation dealt with by <u>Matthew 18</u>. If
we know or suspect that we have sinned against a brother, we are not to wait
until the brother comes to us - we are to go to him. A noted author, Jay
Adams, has written that, because of <u>Matthew 5:23-24</u> and <u>Matthew
18:15</u>, the offender and the offended should be meeting in the street
between their respective homes, each on his way to seek reconciliation with
the other.

<i>If a man marries a woman, has sexual relations with her and then, having
come to dislike her, brings false charges against her and defames her

The leaders of that town are to take the man, punish him, and fine him

Scriptures of the Mosaic Law pertaining to family matters (typical of the
above Scripture) are not enforceable in the New Covenant because they
infringe on, and conflict with, the laws of the secular governments under
which we live. Still, there is teaching value in each of them. So, for
example, the <u>Deuteronomy 22:13-19</u> Scripture instructs us (1) to uphold
the value of premarital virginity; (2) to value the permanence of marriage
and not seek divorce for unsubstantial reasons such as dislike; (3) to not
bring false charges against our spouse; and (4) to not impugn our spouse's
reputation. We might also weigh the issue of marriage as required in the
Bible for believers who become sexually involved. It is a difficult issue
that requires more reflection and discussion. Would it be only with a virgin
woman as in the Bible? At the date of this writing, eight states and the
District of Columbia recognize common-law marriage, which is a legally
recognized state of marriage (despite their being no marriage license or
ceremony) by couples who cohabit openly with the intention of being married.
Intent is the key. Even in common-law marriage states, sexual cohabitation
without the intent of being considered married does not create a marriage and
is simply fornication.

Although not addressed in Scripture, fairness probably allows the
offending brother to invite his own witnesses to observe the meeting as
well.

<u>Romans 7</u> makes it clear that we are in the New Covenant Order and not
the Mosaic when it refers to the widow and indicates that she is now freed
from her covenant bond. That would not have been the case were we still
under the Mosaic Covenant. We who are believers have died and been raised in
the Messiah and, although we have been released from the Mosaic Covenant, we
are, nevertheless, expected to apply its teaching in a manner that is
applicable in the New Covenant.

Contrary to the idea of secular society, the Bible enjoins all nations to
acknowledge God and to embrace the principles of God's Law for the governing
of the society. In classical Protestant thought first defined by John
Calvin, this was called the second use of the Law. God's Law (both Mosaic
and New Covenant) provides the framework for society's civil law, so
followers of Yeshua should work toward bringing their civil society into
conformity with its principles. The ideal of all nations acknowledging the
Lordship of God and His Law is repeated throughout the Prophets and the
Writings.

The 613 <i>mitzvot</i> listed by Maimonides and HaChinuch include several
that cannot be literally complied with today. Meir's compilation leaves out
many of them, which is why his compilation lists fewer. None of the
classical Jewish commentators recognize the existence of a New Covenant, and
their interpretations of the <i>Torah</i> Scriptures reflect that view.
