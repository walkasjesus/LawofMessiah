asherah. Then, as Yoshiyahu was turning around, he noticed the burial caves
that were there on the mountain; so he sent and had the bones taken out of
the burial caves and burned them on the altar, thus desecrating it, in
keeping with the word of ADONAI which the man of God had proclaimed,
foretelling that these things would happen.</i>

The Mosaic Law calls for a complete destruction of idolatry including, in
many cases, killing idolaters themselves. During the time of Moses, the
Israelites lived under a theocracy that was governed directly by God that
made these practices reasonable, but today we live under (and are subject to)
governments that are secular. The laws under which we live today do not
allow us to apply many of the Mosaic Laws literally, and they should not
allow it, because the governments under which we now live are not ruled by
God. That notwithstanding, God's extremely negative attitude toward idolatry
should be adopted as our own, and we should seek the Holy Spirit for how to
bring destruction to idolatry in every way that is permissible in our
individual circumstances.

Idolatry, in its broadest terms, comprises not only the worship of false
deities, but anything that we allow to displace God in ruling our lives.
<u>Colossians 3:5</u> lists some of them and, although slaying idolatrous
people is not authorized in the New Covenant, we are called to put to death
instead, things such as sexual immorality, impurity, evil desires, and greed
(see also, <u>Matthew 6:24</u>).

Because today we live under secular laws and governments, we cannot do away
with objects and places of idolatry that are owned by others. We cannot, for
example, smash the statue of Buddha in our neighborhood Chinese restaurant,
nor burn down the Hindu temple across town. We can, however, destroy and
remove from our own houses and domains under our control, idolatry-connected
art, jewelry, books, videos, and other such items that are owned by us, and
we should. Similarly, we should not play games or view videos that depict
idolatrous or occult practices, and should not show approval of those that
do. As for the broader definition of idols, i.e. associations, things and
practices that draw us toward unholy thoughts or deeds or that exercise power
over us that is not from God - these we must renounce and do away with, and
help others to do so as well.

The <i>mitzvot</i> of Maimonides and HaChinuch ascribe credibility to a
literal contemporary interpretation of the Mosaic Scriptures, whereas Meir
does not. For example, in his RN186 and RN187, Maimonides
states<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>
that we must "slay all the people of an apostate city", and "exterminate the
seven Nations that inhabited the Land of Canaan." Meir simply does not
write corresponding <i>mitzvot</i> for these two.
