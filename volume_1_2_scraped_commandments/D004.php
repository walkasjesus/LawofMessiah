is my body!" Also he took a cup of wine, made the b&#039;rakhah, and gave it

<i>On the first day for matzah, when they slaughtered the lamb for Pesach,
Yeshua&#039;s talmidim asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare
your Seder?" He sent two of his talmidim with these instructions: "Go into
the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him; and
whichever house he enters, tell him that the Rabbi says, &#039;Where is the
guest room for me, where I am to eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim?&#039;
He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the
preparations there." The talmidim went off, came to the city and found
things just as he had told them they would be; and they prepared the Seder.
When evening came, Yeshua arrived with the Twelve. As they were reclining
and eating, Yeshua said, "Yes! I tell you that one of you is going to betray
me." They became upset and began asking him, one after the other, "You
don&#039;t mean me, do you?" "It&#039;s one of the Twelve," he said to
them, "someone dipping matzah in the dish with me. For the Son of Man will
die, just as the Tanakh says he will; but woe to that man by whom the Son of
Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him had he never been born!"
While they were eating, Yeshua took a piece of matzah, made the
b&#039;rakhah, broke it, gave it to them and said, "Take it! This is my
body." Also he took a cup of wine, made the b&#039;rakhah, and gave it to
them; and they all drank. He said to them, "This is my blood, which ratifies
the New Covenant, my blood shed on behalf of many people. Yes! I tell you, I
will not drink this &#039;fruit of the vine&#039; again until the day I
drink new wine in the Kingdom of God."</i>

so we can eat." They asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare it?" He
told them, "As you&#039;re going into the city, a man carrying a jar of
water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters, and say to its
owner, &#039;The Rabbi says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I am to
eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim?"&#039; He will show you a large room
upstairs already furnished; make the preparations there." They went and
found things just as Yeshua had told them they would be, and they prepared
for the Seder. When the time came, Yeshua and the emissaries reclined at the
table, and he said to them, "I have really wanted so much to celebrate this
Seder with you before I die! For I tell you, it is certain that I will not
celebrate it again until it is given its full meaning in the Kingdom of
God." Then, taking a cup of wine, he made the b&#039;rakhah and said, "Take
this and share it among yourselves. For I tell you that from now on, I will
not drink the &#039;fruit of the vine&#039; until the Kingdom of God comes."
Also, taking a piece of matzah, he made the b&#039;rakhah, broke it, gave it
to them and said, "This is my body, which is being given for you; do this in
memory of me." He did the same with the cup after the meal, saying, "This
cup is the New Covenant, ratified by my blood, which is being poured out for
you."</i>

(Maimonides RP49, RP165; Chinuch C15)
<br>
<i>ADONAI spoke with Moshe after the death of Aharon&#039;s two sons, when they
tried to sacrifice before ADONAI and died; ADONAI said to Moshe, "Tell your
brother Aharon not to come at just any time into the Holy Place beyond the
curtain, in front of the ark-cover which is on the ark, so that he will not
die; because I appear in the cloud over the ark-cover. Here is how Aharon
is to enter the Holy Place: with a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as
a burnt offering. He is to put on the holy linen tunic, have the linen
shorts next to his bare flesh, have the linen sash wrapped around him, and
be wearing the linen turban- they are the holy garments. He is to bathe his
body in water and put them on. He is to take from the community of the
people of Isra&#039;el two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a
burnt offering. Aharon is to present the bull for the sin offering which is
for himself and make atonement for himself and his household. He is to take
the two goats and place them before ADONAI at the entrance to the tent of
meeting. Then Aharon is to cast lots for the two goats, one lot for ADONAI
and the other for &#039;Az&#039;azel. Aharon is to present the goat whose
lot fell to ADONAI and offer it as a sin offering. But the goat whose lot
fell to &#039;Az&#039;azel is to be presented alive to ADONAI to be used for
making atonement over it by sending it away into the desert for
&#039;Az&#039;azel. Aharon is to present the bull of the sin offering for
himself; he will make atonement for himself and his household; he is to
slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself. He is to take
a censer full of burning coals from the altar before ADONAI and, with his
hands full of ground, fragrant incense, bring it inside the curtain. He is
to put the incense on the fire before ADONAI, so that the cloud from the
incense will cover the ark-cover which is over the testimony, in order that
he not die. He is to take some of the bull&#039;s blood and sprinkle it
with his finger on the ark-cover toward the east; and in front of the
ark-cover he is to sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
Next, he is to slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the
people, bring its blood inside the curtain and do with its blood as he did
with the bull&#039;s blood, sprinkling it on the ark-cover and in front of
the ark-cover. He will make atonement for the Holy Place because of the
uncleannesses of the people of Isra&#039;el and because of their
transgressions - all their sins; and he is to do the same for the tent of
meeting which is there with them right in the middle of their uncleannesses.
No one is to be present in the tent of meeting from the time he enters the
Holy Place to make atonement until the time he comes out, having made
atonement for himself, for his household and for the entire community of
Isra&#039;el. Then he is to go out to the altar that is before ADONAI and
make atonement for it; he is to take some of the bull&#039;s blood and some
of the goat&#039;s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar. He is to
sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, thus purifying
it and setting it apart from the uncleannesses of the people of
Isra&#039;el. When he has finished atoning for the Holy Place, the tent of
meeting and the altar, he is to present the live goat. Aharon is to lay
both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the
transgressions, crimes and sins of the people of Isra&#039;el; he is to put
them on the head of the goat and then send it away into the desert with a
man appointed for the purpose. The goat will bear all their transgressions
away to some isolated place, and he is to let the goat go in the desert.
Aharon is to go back into the tent of meeting, where he is to remove the
linen garments he put on when he entered the Holy Place, and he is to leave
them there. Then he is to bathe his body in water in a holy place, put on
his other clothes, come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt
offering of the people, thus making atonement for himself and for the
people. He is to make the fat of the sin offering go up in smoke on the
altar.The man who let go the goat for &#039;Az&#039;azel is to wash his
clothes and bathe his body in water; afterwards, he may return to the camp.
The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose
blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, is to be carried
outside the camp; there they are to burn up completely their hides, meat and
dung. The person burning them is to wash his clothes and bathe his body in
water; afterwards, he may return to the camp. It is to be a permanent
regulation for you that on the tenth day of the seventh month you are to
deny yourselves and not do any kind of work, both the citizen and the
foreigner living with you. For on this day, atonement will be made for you

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> bestows the term "Annual Sabbath" on seven of the
annually-occurring "designated times" listed in <u>Leviticus 23</u>. This is
because, as in the case of the weekly Sabbath, we are commanded to rest on
them, refrain from work, and assemble. Of these however, only one of them -
<i>Yom Kippur</i> - is actually termed a Sabbath in the Scriptures. Each of
these days has its unique theme and reason for being, but because they bear
a basic similarity to the weekly Sabbath, the related issues of work, rest,
and application to Gentiles will be dealt with here only briefly.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The first and seventh days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread remind us of
God's provision and our need to purge leaven (analogized to sin) from
our lives (<u>1 Corinthians 5:7-8</u>). Of all the feasts, Passover is the
one that has most caught the attention of the Christian Church. This is
because of the obvious analogy of the Passover lamb sacrifice to Yeshua's
sacrifice, where the blood of each of the sacrifices, saved those who
applied it.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The next "designated time" listed on the biblical calendar, <i>Shavuot</i>,
was historically commanded to the Israelites to commemorate the Spring
harvest, but it is relevant to Gentile followers of Yeshua as well, both as
an identification with the Jewish People, and also as a memorial of the
<i>Shavuot</i> that occurred centuries later, when God made the Holy Spirit
available on earth to all of mankind (<u>Acts 2:1-21, 10:45</u>). Christian
terminology for this day is
"Pentecost"<sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>.
<i>Shavuot</i> is unique among the Annual Sabbaths in being the only one that
Scripture does not assign a particular date on the lunar calendar. Instead,
<u>Leviticus 23:10,15-16</u> states:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Tell the people of Israel, 'After you enter the land I am giving you and
harvest its ripe crops, you are to bring a sheaf od firstfruits of your
harvest to the cohen ... From the day after the day of rest - that is, from
the day you bring the sheaf for waving - you are to count seven full weeks,
until the day after the seventh week; you are to count fifty days; and then
you are to present a new grain offering to ADONAI.'</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This fifty-day count from "the day after the day of rest" (or Sabbath) is
known in Jewish practice as "counting the <i>omer</i>", and which one of
several possible Sabbaths is "day zero" of the count is a subject of ongoing
dispute that involves two different days that Scripture refers to as
"firstfruits". The first of these is the one in <u>Leviticus 23:10</u> which,
for clarity, I will refer to as <i>Yom
Habbikurim</i>.<sup><small><a name=fr2 href=#fn2>2</a></small></sup>
The second occurance is in <u>Numbers 28:26</u>, where the term is again
used, but for <i>Shavuot</i>.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Yom T'ruah</i> (day of blowing) is also known as the "Day of Trumpets" or
"<i>Shofarot</i>", and as "<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>" (head of the year, i.e. New
Year) by the Rabbinic community. It is followed ten days later by <i>Yom
Kippur</i> (Day of Atonement). Although these days were historically
commanded to the Israelites, Gentile followers of Yeshua may choose to
observe them as well, both to identify with the Jewish People, and also to
use as times of personal introspection and repentance that may lead to
joining with their Jewish brothers in praying for Israel on <i>Yom
Kippur</i>. This is especially appropriate when one considers the elevated
position of New Covenant believers (both Jews and non-Jews) as priests under
Messiah Yeshua (<u>1 Peter 2:5-10</u>; <u>Revelation 1:4-7</u>).
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Finally, <i>Sukkot</i> is particularly significant for Gentiles, because
Scripture prophecies the time when all the Gentile nations on earth will be
required to join with Israel in keeping the Feast referred to in <u>Zechariah
14:16-19</u>. This appears to be a nation-to-nation mandate and not one
directed to individuals.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Although "rest" is not specifically mentioned in the supporting Scriptures
for the Feast of Unleavened Bread and for <i>Shavuot</i>, it is strongly
implied by the requirement that we not work. Also, although in <u>Hebrews
4:2-11</u> it is the weekly Sabbath rest that is analogized to resting in
Messiah, its application to all of the annual Sabbaths is unmistakable.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
I am of the view that complying with these Annual Sabbaths by resting,
abstaining from work, and assembling, is mandatory for Jews and
<i>K'rovei Yisrael</i> Gentiles but, with the exception of the Feast of
<i>Sukkot</i> is not mandatory for Gentiles generally. That notwithstanding,
I believe that blessing comes to Gentiles who keep the Annual Sabbaths,
analogous to the blessing for keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath that is
promised in <u>Isaiah 56:1-7</u>. Keeping the Annual Sabbaths also serves to
connect Gentile believers to their Jewish brethren, and enhances
understanding of the events in history that led to the Messiah's coming
and to the New Covenant.

My view on this is that, without the support of civil law as we have in
Israel, it is very difficult for Jews to do all of the Sabbaths (e.g. the
seventh day of Passover and the 8<sup><small>th</small></sup> Day of
<i>Sh'mini Atzeret</i>) because the number of days are just too difficult in
a non-Jewish society. I think Messianic Jews should seek to keep them all as
an ideal, but there is, in my view, allowance in the Diaspora for some degree
of indulgence.

Regarding Gentiles, there is no requirement for them to embrace the Sabbath
days, as is made most clear in <u>Colossians 2</u>, <u>Romans 14</u>, and
<u>Galatians 5</u>. Also, although there is no evidence in any historical
text that this was ever expected of Gentile believers, they are not relieved
from understanding and applying these Sabbath days as their communities and
they, as individuals, are led by the Holy Spirit. Of course, even when some
level of compliance is decided upon, Gentiles are not called to add
extra-biblical rabbinical practices, although they are not prohibited from
them either. The literal partaking of the Annual Sabbaths is covenantal to
the Jewish people and would seem to have application to Gentile believers in
their communities as follows:
<ol>
<li> There should be teachings regarding the meanings of all the Sabbaths.
<li> It would be good and reasonable to teach on the Sabbaths in the seasons
of their actual celebrations in Israel and in the Jewish community.
This connects the Christian world to the Jewish people with whom they
are joined through Yeshua (<u>Romans 11</u>).
<li> Whenever Christian communities are led to celebrate these Sabbaths, it
would be sufficient for them to do so on the weekends closest to their
biblically prescribed dates.
<li> Lastly, Christians may choose to abstain from work and rest on these
Sabbaths (similar to their Jewish brothers) in identification with the
Jewish people.
<li> How the Sabbaths are acknowledged and expressed in each Christian
community should be led by the Holy Spirit.

Maimonides and Meir loosely refer to the "first day of Passover" when they
mean the first day of Unleavened Bread. This is a common Jewish practice,
but is at odds with the biblical definition which describes Passover as the
period from before sundown on the 14<sup><small>th</small></sup> day of the
first month (<i>Nisan</i> 14), to sometime early the next day (<i>Nisan</i>
15), when the Israelites began their exodus from Egypt. HaChinuch
specifically refers to <i>Nisan</i> 15, and all three commentators recognize
the exception from not doing work when food preparation is needed. HaChinuch
considers the first and seventh days of "Passover" to be a single festival,
unlike the case of <i>Sh'mini Atzeret</i>.

In their writings, Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch assume the common
rabbinical practice in the Diaspora of doubling up on each of the Annual
Sabbaths except for <i>Yom Kippur</i>. The reason for this duplication is
interesting, but will not be explored further here.
