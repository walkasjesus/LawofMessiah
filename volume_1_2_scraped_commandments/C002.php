The essence of this <i>Mitzvah</i> is that we must not oppress an employee by
withholding or delaying payment of his wages. There are many kinds of
employees today in many occupations. Some are day laborers and some are poor
and some are not. It is customary to pay a hired man or employee at the end
of a specified period of time that may be daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly,
or at the conclusion of a contract, so this <i>Mitzvah</i> should not be
interpreted to require that all workers be paid daily. That having been
said, <u>Deuteronomy 24:14-15</u> requires that an employer pay a hired man
daily if the man's impoverished condition makes it reasonable and
compassionate to do so.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The inference of <u>Deuteronomy 14</u> is that not paying wages to a poor
worker in a timely manner is akin to exploiting him, and there are
undoubtedly unscrupulous employers who would withhold or delay the payment of
wages to a poor worker in order to pressure the worker into giving the
employer some kind of advantage. This <i>Mitzvah</i> can, therefore, be
construed to have a broader meaning, which is to not exploit an employee's
weakness to gain advantage.
