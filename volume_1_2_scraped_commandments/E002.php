Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the

the man who is physically uncircumcised but obeys the Torah will stand as a

circumcision is not only external and physical. On the contrary, the real
Jew is one inwardly; and true circumcision is of the heart, spiritual not
literal; so that his praise comes not from other people but from God. Then
what advantage has the Jew? What is the value of being circumcised? Much in

<i>But some men came down from Y&#039;hudah to Antioch and began teaching the
brothers, "You can&#039;t be saved unless you undergo b&#039;rit-milah in
the manner prescribed by Moshe." This brought them into no small measure of
discord and dispute with Sha&#039;ul and Bar-Nabba. So the congregation
assigned Sha&#039;ul, Bar-Nabba and some of themselves to go and put this
sh&#039;eilah before the emissaries and the elders up in Yerushalayim.
After being sent off by the congregation, they made their way through
Phoenicia and Shomron, recounting in detail how the Gentiles had turned to
God; and this news brought great joy to all the brothers. On arrival in
Yerushalayim, they were welcomed by the Messianic community, including the
emissaries and the elders; and they reported what God had done through them.
But some of those who had come to trust were from the party of the
P&#039;rushim; and they stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise
them and direct them to observe the Torah of Moshe." The emissaries and the
elders met to look into this matter. After lengthy debate, Kefa got up and
said to them, "Brothers, you yourselves know that a good while back, God
chose me from among you to be the one by whose mouth the Goyim should hear
the message of the Good News and come to trust. And God, who knows the
heart, bore them witness by giving the Ruach HaKodesh to them, just as he
did to us; that is, he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed
their heart by trust. So why are you putting God to the test now by placing
a yoke on the neck of the talmidim which neither our fathers nor we have had
the strength to bear? No, it is through the love and kindness of the Lord
Yeshua that we trust and are delivered - and it&#039;s the same with them."
Then the whole assembly kept still as they listened to Bar-Nabba and
Sha&#039;ul tell what signs and miracles God had done through them among the
Gentiles. Ya&#039;akov broke the silence to reply. "Brothers," he said,
"hear what I have to say. Shim&#039;on has told in detail what God did when
he first began to show his concern for taking from among the Goyim a people
to bear his name. And the words of the Prophets are in complete harmony
with this for it is written, &#039;"After this, I will return; and I will
rebuild the fallen tent of David. I will rebuild its ruins, I will restore
it, so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, that is, all the Goyim
who have been called by my name," says ADONAI, who is doing these
things.&#039; All this has been known for ages. Therefore, my opinion is
that we should not put obstacles in the way of the Goyim who are turning to
God. Instead, we should write them a letter telling them to abstain from
things polluted by idols, from fornication, from what is strangled and from
blood."</i>

It is a common misunderstanding to believe that God's covenant with Abraham
(repeated through Isaac and Jacob) applies only to Jews. The Abrahamic
Covenant defines the Jewish people generationally, but it is also the
framework for Gentiles to willfully connect themselves to the Jewish people,
thereby enlarging the "people of God" that comprises both Jews and Gentiles.
It is why God told Abraham that he would be the "<i>father of many
nations.</i>" (<u>Genesis 17:4</u>). That notwithstanding, Gentiles (even
<i>K'rovei Yisrael</i> - those closely connected to a Jewish community) are
not themselves Jews because their priestly identity and covenantal
responsibilities are not inherited, but are rather, voluntarily derived from
their connection to the Jewish People through their covenant with the Jewish
Messiah. In the Mosaic Covenant, Gentiles who wanted a special covenantal
relationship with God received it by physically moving into the Jewish camp,
becoming circumcised, sacrificing at the Tabernacle or Temple, and becoming
part of the Jewish community. In the New Covenant, Gentiles who want a
special covenantal relationship with God receive it by becoming grafted into
the "Jewish" olive tree through faith in Messiah Yeshua (see Romans

<i>B'rit milah</i> (covenant circumcision) was (and still is) required of all
Jewish males who are eight days old lest they be cut off from the covenant
they have inherited. In the Mosaic Covenant, circumcision was required of
any Gentile male who lived in a Jewish household and wished to covenantally
connect to the Jewish people. Such a Gentile became subject to most of the
commandments of <i>Torah</i>, but it did not result in his becoming a Jew or

Circumcising a Jewish child has historically been considered the duty of the
child's father, but an experienced circumciser (a <i>mohel</i>) is often
employed. The surgery can be performed by a non-Jew, but only a Jew can
receive the child into the covenant. The prevailing view is that <i>b'rit
milah</i> should be done on the eighth day after birth when possible. So
important is this eighth day principle, that <i>halachah</i> requires that
circumcision be performed on that day even if it falls on a Sabbath.

Jewish individuals who have been broken off of their
olive tree through unbelief have to be re-grafted. Jews that remain
unconnected to their tree retain their covenantal responsibilities but not
their salvific relationship with God.

Uncircumcised Gentiles can participate in
today&#039;s Passover <i>seders</i> because today&#039;s <i>seders</i> do
not include eating a sacrificed Passover animal (see <u>Exodus
12:43-49</u>). In <u>1 Corinthians 5:7-8</u>, Paul makes it clear that
Yeshua is our sacrificed lamb, and he thereby encourages the Gentiles to
whom he is speaking to celebrate the <i>seder</i>. We do not require that
<i>K&#039;rov Yisrael</i> Gentiles be circumcised.

We note that participating at Passover <i>seders</i> has special meaning for
believers in Yeshua because the fullness of the meaning of Passover is in the
death of Yeshua as our Passover Lamb. As such, in the New Covenant order,
both Jews and Gentiles commonly participate in the meaning of the Passover
sacrifice in its New Covenant fulfilment form. Regarding Gentile
participants in particular, since the Passover meal practiced by Jewish
people today is a memorial without the sacrificial lamb, it is common for
Gentiles to participate, even in traditional Jewish <i>seders</i>, without
violating the Scriptures.

Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch are in agreement concerning the requirement
that a Jewish baby be circumcised on the eighth day if possible. HaChinuch
and Meir state that if a Jewish baby is not circumcised, then there is a
continuing obligation on the part of the uncircumcised individual to become
circumcised when he is older. It is interesting that Maimonides and HaChinuch
state that mothers have no responsibility to circumcise their sons in view of
Moses' wife Zipporah having circumcised her son (<u>Exodus 4:24-26</u>). Meir
states that circumcision should be done after sunrise.
