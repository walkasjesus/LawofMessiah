<u>Exodus 23:28-33</u>
(Maimonides RN48; Chinuch C93)
<br>
<i>I will send hornets ahead of you to drive out the Hivi, Kena&#039;ani and
Hitti from before you. I will not drive them out from before you in one
year, which would cause the land to become desolate and the wild animals too
many for you. I will drive them out from before you gradually, until you
have grown in number and can take possession of the land. I will set your
boundaries from the Sea of Suf to the sea of the P&#039;lishtim and from the
desert to the [Euphrates] River, for I will hand the inhabitants of the land
over to you, and you will drive them out from before you. You are not to
make a covenant with them or with their gods. They are not to live in your
land; otherwise they will make you sin against me by ensnaring you to serve
their gods.</i>

<u>Exodus 34:11-16</u>
<br>
<i>Observe what I am ordering you to do today. Here! I am driving out ahead of
you the Emori, Kena&#039;ani, Hitti, P&#039;rizi, Hivi and Y&#039;vusi. Be
careful not to make a covenant with the people living in the land where you
are going, so that they won&#039;t become a snare within your own borders.
Rather, you are to demolish their altars, smash their standing-stones and
cut down their sacred poles; because you are not to bow down to any other
god; since ADONAI - whose very name is Jealous - is a jealous God. Do not
make a covenant with the people living in the land. It will cause you to go
astray after their gods and sacrifice to their gods. Then they will invite
you to join them in eating their sacrifices, and you will take their
daughters as wives for your sons. Their daughters will prostitute themselves
to their own gods and make your sons do the same!</i>

<u>Numbers 25:3-15</u>
(Maimonides RN52; Chinuch C427)
<br>
<i>With Isra&#039;el thus joined to Ba&#039;al-P&#039;or, the anger of ADONAI
blazed up against Isra&#039;el. ADONAI said to Moshe, "Take all the chiefs
of the people, and hang them facing the sun before ADONAI, so that the
raging fury of ADONAI will turn away from Isra&#039;el." Moshe said to the
judges of Isra&#039;el, "Each of you is to put to death those in his tribe
who have joined themselves to Ba&#039;al-P&#039;or." Just then, in the
sight of Moshe and the whole community of Isra&#039;el, as they were weeping
at the entrance to the tent of meeting, a man from Isra&#039;el came by,
bringing to his family a woman from Midyan. When Pinchas the son of
El&#039;azar, the son of Aharon the cohen, saw it, he got up from the middle
of the crowd, took a spear in his hand, and pursued the man from
Isra&#039;el right into the inner part of the tent, where he thrust his
spear through both of them - the man from Isra&#039;el and the woman through
her stomach. Thus was the plague among the people of Isra&#039;el stopped;
nevertheless, 24,000 died in the plague. ADONAI said to Moshe, "Pinchas the
son of El&#039;azar, the son of Aharon the cohen, has deflected my anger
from the people of Isra&#039;el by being as zealous as I am, so that I
didn&#039;t destroy them in my own zeal. Therefore say, &#039;I am giving
him my covenant of shalom, making a covenant with him and his descendants
after him that the office of cohen will be theirs forever.&#039; This is
because he was zealous on behalf of his God and made atonement for the
people of Isra&#039;el." The name of the man from Isra&#039;el who was
killed, put to death with the woman from Midyan, was Zimri the son of Salu,
leader of one of the clans from the tribe of Shim&#039;on. The name of the
woman from Midyan who was killed was Kozbi the daughter of Tzur, and he was
head of the people in one of the clans of Midyan.</i>

<u>Deuteronomy 7:1-6</u>
(Maimonides RN48, RN52; Meir MN19; Chinuch C93, C427)
<br>
<i>ADONAI your God is going to bring you into the land you will enter in order
to take possession of it, and he will expel many nations ahead of you - the
Hitti, Girgashi, Emori, Kena&#039;ani, P&#039;rizi, Hivi and Y&#039;vusi,
seven nations bigger and stronger than you. When he does this, when ADONAI
your God hands them over ahead of you, and you defeat them, you are to
destroy them completely! Do not make any covenant with them. Show them no
mercy. Don&#039;t intermarry with them - don&#039;t give your daughter to
his son, and don&#039;t take his daughter for your son. For he will turn
your children away from following me in order to serve other gods. If this
happens, the anger of ADONAI will flare up against you, and he will quickly
destroy you. No, treat them this way: break down their altars, smash their
standing-stones to pieces, cut down their sacred poles and burn up their
carved images completely. For you are a people set apart as holy for ADONAI
your God. ADONAI your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face
of the earth to be his own unique treasure.</i>

ADONAI, because they did not supply you with food and water when you were on
the road after leaving Egypt, and because they hired Bil&#039;am the son of

righteousness and lawlessness be partners? What fellowship does light have

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The Scriptures are plain in commanding that we are not to enter into
covenants with idolaters and unbelievers in God, Yeshua, or the Bible. The
kinds of covenants prohibited are not trivial agreements, but rather the kind
that yoke individuals in causes for which the covenanting parties'
understanding of God, morality, and ethics is material. Likewise, the kinds
of idolaters contemplated are not those with minor personal bondages, but
rather those whose idolatries render them unbelievers or persons whose
judgments are likely to adversely affect the covenants into which they enter.
The result of a believer entering into covenant with such a person can be
isastrous because a believer's basis for conduct is God's Law, whereas an
unbeliever recognizes no such authority.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The prohibition of this <i>Mitzvah</i> does not usually apply to contracts
such as those to buy or sell a described item at a defined price, because the
terms of such agreements are not vague and are usually not dependent on the
moral and ethical values of the parties. On the other hand, partnerships of
most kinds (especially marriage) by believers and unbelievers are prohibited
because, in the course of continuously dealing with one another, partners
must be biblically in accord in handling situations as they arise. In cases
of unequal yoking, the covenanting parties hold different values and respond
to different authorities for their conduct; the result is that, sooner or
later, they will either dissolve their covenant and part ways, or the
believing party will be persuaded by the unbelieving party to compromise his
or her biblical principles. Many a marriage and business partnership has
been shattered through unequal yoking.

Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch limit their <i>mitzvot</i> to the kinds of
idolatries that are prevalent in the <i>Tanakh</i> - the kinds that involve
unbelief in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the consequent worship
of heathen gods and physical idols. The people groups they include are the
seven nations of Canaan and the Ammonites, Moabites, and heretics in general.
They do not address idolatries of the heart and flesh.
