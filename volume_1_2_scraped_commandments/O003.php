<i>Then the talmidim came and asked Yeshua, "Why are you speaking to them in
parables?" He answered, "Because it has been given to you to know the
secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it has not been given to them. For
anyone who has something will be given more, so that he will have plenty;
but from anyone who has nothing, even what he does have will be taken away.
Here is why I speak to them in parables: they look without seeing and listen
without hearing or understanding. That is, in them is fulfilled the
prophecy of Yesha&#039;yahu which says, &#039;You will keep on hearing but
never understand, and keep on seeing but never perceive, because the heart
of this people has become dull - with their ears they barely hear, and their
eyes they have closed, so as not to see with their eyes, hear with their
ears, understand with their heart, and do t&#039;shuvah, so that I could
heal them.&#039; But you, how blessed are your eyes, because they see, and
your ears, because they hear! Yes indeed! I tell you that many a prophet
and many a tzaddik longed to see the things you are seeing but did not see
them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.</i>

<u>Matthew 13:19-23</u>
<br>
<i>Whoever hears the message about the Kingdom, but doesn&#039;t understand it,
is like the seed sown along the path - the Evil One comes and seizes what
was sown in his heart. The seed sown on rocky ground is like a person who
hears the message and accepts it with joy at once, but has no root in
himself. So he stays on for a while; but as soon as some trouble or
persecution arises on account of the message, he immediately falls away.
Now the seed sown among thorns stands for someone who hears the message, but
it is choked by the worries of the world and the deceitful glamor of wealth,
so that it produces nothing. However, what was sown on rich soil is the one
who hears the message and understands it; such a person will surely bear
fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was sown.</i>

<u>Matthew 15:22-28</u>
<br>
<i>A woman from Kena&#039;an who was living there came to him, pleading, "Sir,
have pity on me. Son of David! My daughter is cruelly held under the power
of demons!" But Yeshua did not say a word to her. Then his talmidim came to
him and urged him, "Send her away, because she is following us and keeps
pestering us with her crying." He said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep
of the house of Isra&#039;el." But she came, fell at his feet and said,
"Sir, help me!" He answered, "It is not right to take the children&#039;s
food and toss it to their pet dogs." She said, "That is true, sir, but even
the dogs eat the leftovers that fall from their master&#039;s table." Then
Yeshua answered her, "Lady, you are a person of great trust. Let your desire
be granted." And her daughter was healed at that very moment.</i>

<u>Luke 8:4-14</u>
<br>
<i>After a large crowd had gathered from the people who kept coming to him from
town after town, Yeshua told this parable: "A farmer went out to sow his
seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path and was stepped on, and the
birds flying around ate it up. Some fell on rock; and after it sprouted, it
dried up from lack of moisture. Some fell in the midst of thorns, and the
thorns grew up with it and choked it. But some fell into rich soil, and
grew, and produced a hundred times as much as had been sown." After saying
this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear with, let him hear!" His
talmidim asked him what this parable might mean, and he said, "To you it has
been given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God; but the rest are
taught in parables, so that they may look but not see, and listen but not
understand. The parable is this: the seed is God&#039;s message. The ones
along the path are those who hear, but then the Adversary comes and takes
the message out of their hearts, in order to keep them from being saved by
trusting it. The ones on rock are those who, when they hear the word,
accept it with joy; but these have no root - they go on trusting for awhile;
but when a time of testing comes, they apostatize. As for what fell in the
midst of thorns these are the ones who hear; but as they go along, worries
and wealth and life&#039;s gratifications crowd in and choke them, so that
their fruit never matures. But what fell in rich soil - these are the ones
who, when they hear the message, hold onto it with a good, receptive heart;
and by persevering, they bring forth a harvest."</i>

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
One assumes that preaching holiness to persons closed to it is a waste of
time, but Scripture goes beyond that and commands us not to do it because it
is actually dangerous (<u>Matthew 7:6 & 10:16-17</u>). That does not mean
that we should refrain from preaching the Word of God to groups and
individuals in the hope that some who hear it are open. It does however mean
that we are to exercise discernment regarding the response we get, and not
pursue those whom it is clear are closed because the Holy Spirit has not
prepared them.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 15:22-28</u> illustrates that Yeshua himself abided by the
principle of this <i>Mitzvah</i> by at first ignoring the pleas of the
Gentile woman from Canaan whom Yeshua assumed was begging him to heal her
daughter out of desperation and not out of godly conviction. That would have
been the case of most Gentiles in those days and Yeshua, having divested
himself of his powers of deity, did not have insight beyond that of other
men. However, when the woman responded to his rebuff with godly wisdom,
Yeshua realized that, despite her being a Gentile she was a woman of faith,
and he granted her request.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Yeshua's assumption that most Gentiles in those days were not yet ready
to receive the things of God was why at first, Yeshua sent his disciples only
to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" with the following instruction:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 10:7-14:</u>&nbps; <i>As you go, proclaim, 'The Kingdom of Heaven
is near,' heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those afflicted with
tzara'at, expel demons. You have received without paying, so give without
asking payment. Don't take money in your belts, no gold, no silver, no
copper; and for the trip don't take a pack, an extra shirt, shoes or a
walking stick- a worker should be given what he needs. When you come to a
town or village, look for someone trustworthy and stay with him until you
leave. When you enter someone's household, say, 'Shalom aleikhem!' If the
home deserves it, let your shalom rest on it; if not, let your shalom return
to you. But if the people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen
to you, leave it and shake its dust from your feet!</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Later on, closer to the time when Yeshua would be returning to the Father and
sending back the Holy Spirit, he broadened his instruction to his disciples
to include the Gentiles:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<u>Matthew 10:18b-20:</u>&nbsp; <i>All authority in heaven and on earth has
been given to me. Therefore, go and make people from all nations into
talmidim, immersing them into the reality of the Father, the Son and the
Ruach HaKodesh, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded
you. And remember! I will be with you always, yes, even until the end of the
age.</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
That notwithstanding, Yeshua's instruction in <u>verse 14</u> "<i>But if the
people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen to you, leave it and
shake its dust from your feet!</i>" applied to the Gentiles as well.
