<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Serving our neighbor is meeting his needs in the way that we would want him
to meet our needs (<u>Matthew 7:12</u>), were our situations reversed. The
reason that servanthood is critically important is that it comprises specific
ways to love our neighbor that is never without cost or sacrifice to
ourselves. When we help our neighbor build because he needs shelter, we give
of our time that we could otherwise spend on our own needs or pleasures.
When we give our neighbor food (or money) because he is hungry, we give him a
valuable resource that we could otherwise consume or spend on ourselves. I
am reminded of <u>James 2:15-16</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food, and someone
says to him, 'Shalom! Keep warm and eat hearty!' without giving him what he
needs, what good does it do?</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The two examples above are of physical helps, but servanthood often involves
giving of ourselves in less tangible ways as well, such as correcting,
counseling, and praying for our neighbor.
