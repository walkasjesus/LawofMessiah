<u>Numbers 31:2-16(1-15)</u>
(Maimonides RP94, RP95, RN157; Meir MP39, MP40, MN184;
Chinuch C406, C407, C575)
<br>
<i>Then Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the people of Isra&#039;el.
He said, "Here is what ADONAI has ordered: when a man makes a vow to ADONAI
or formally obligates himself by swearing an oath, he is not to break his
word but is to do everything he said he would do. When a woman makes a vow
to ADONAI, formally obligating herself, while she is a minor living in her
father&#039;s house; then, if her father has heard what she vowed or
obligated herself to do and holds his peace, then all her vows remain
binding - every obligation she has bound herself to will stand. But if on the
day her father hears it, he expresses his disapproval, then none of her vows
or obligations she has bound herself to will stand; and ADONAI will forgive
her, because her father expressed his disapproval. If, having made vows or
rashly committed herself to an obligation, she gets married; and her husband
hears but holds his peace with her on the day he learns of it, then her vows
and obligations she has bound herself to will stand. But if her husband
expresses his disapproval on the day he hears it, he will void the vow which
is on her and the obligation to which she has bound herself; and ADONAI will
forgive her. The vow of a widow, however, or of a divorcee, including
everything to which she has obligated herself, will stand against her. If a
woman vowed in her husband&#039;s house or obligated herself with an oath;
and her husband heard it but held his peace with her and did not express
disapproval, then all her vows and obligations will stand. But if her
husband makes them null and void on the day he hears them, then whatever she
said, vows or binding obligation, will not stand; her husband has voided
them; and ADONAI will forgive her. Her husband may let every vow and every
binding obligation stand, or he may void it. But if her husband entirely
holds his peace with her day after day, then he confirms all her vows and
obligations; he must let them stand, because he held his peace with her on
the day he heard them. If he makes them null and void after he has heard
them, then he will bear the consequent guilt."</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
This <i>Mitzvah</i> "Keeping Our Promises" is a generalization of several
more specific <i>mitzvot</i> promulgated by the Classical Commentators
Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch having to do with keeping oral commitments,
and delaying or revoking vows.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
In addition to the <i>Torah</i> Scriptures, our obligation to keep our
promises appears to also be the message of <u>Matthew 5:33-37</u> and
<u>James 5:12</u>, their general rule being:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>... let your 'Yes' be simply 'Yes' and your 'No' simply 'No'.</i>

<u>James</u> advises against swearing oaths to emphasize one's truthfulness.
The expectation is that whatever New Covenant believers say ought to be so
trustworthy that, except for society's requirement of submission to judicial
authorities and its laws pertaining to certain legal documents, we should
avoid swearing oaths. It is part of the intensification of <i>Torah</i> in
the New Covenant.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
The literal application of <u>Numbers 30:4-16(3-15)</u> was operative under
the Mosaic Covenant in ancient Israel when women had fewer legal rights than
men, and their fathers or husbands could intercede to nullify their vows made
to God and others. That may continue to be the secular law in various places
of the world today, and it is the prevailing secular law today that parents
can nullify contracts made by their minor children, and guardians can nullify
commitments made by those who are adjudicated legally incompetent. It should
not have to be said (but I will say it), that under the New Covenant (also
under today's Anglo-American law), adult women are no longer legally
subordinate to their fathers and husbands as they were in the past.

It must be said that vows affect communal and family relations. Because the
Bible gives a husband headship in the marriage and family, it is my view that
his authority with regard to vows, contracts and important promises still
remains for the Body of believers. Although the secular courts today will
not credit his authority in such situations, the courts of the Body of
Believers will often do so.

Maimonides, Meir, and HaChinuch limit their mitzvot to promises made orally,
although one can infer that they encompass written contracts as well.
Maimonides recognizes exceptions to the general rule in the case of wives and
daughters who are under the authority of their husbands and fathers
respectively. Meir makes no exception for women in his <i>mitzvot</i>, but
cites the <i>Talmudic</i> rule that allows an "expert scholar" or three
"ordinary persons" to release a "man" from a vow that he has made and
subsequently regrets.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
HaChinuch cites the <i>Talmudic</i> rule but states that, according to
Maimonides, it should not be listed among the compilation of <i>mitzvot</i>.
He then goes on to expound the rule and describes four situations in which a
man should be released from his vow. Of the three commentators mentioned,
HaChinuch treats the subject far more in depth than the other two.
