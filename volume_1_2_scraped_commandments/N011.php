cakes." Avraham ran to the herd, took a good, tender calf and gave it to

a handful of meal in a pot and a little oil in the jug. Here I am, gathering
a couple sticks of wood, so that I can go and cook it for myself and my son.
After we have eaten that, we will die." Eliyahu said to her, "Don&#039;t be
afraid. Go; and do what you said; but first, use a little of it to make me a
small loaf of bread; and bring it out to me. After that, make food for
yourself and your son. For this is what ADONAI the God of Isra&#039;el,
says: &#039;The pot of meal will not get used up, nor will there fail to be
oil in the jug, until the day ADONAI sends rain down on the land.&#039;" She
went and acted according to what Eliyahu had said; and she, he and her

up, nor did there fail to be oil in the jug, in fulfillment of the word of

Hospitality is often thought of as inviting people into our homes, feeding
them, and giving them lodging. That is, of course, hospitality, but
hospitality is broader than that - it is giving of oneself, often at a cost.
It stands alongside of charity and generosity as being among the most
important attributes of a believer because it requires that we put the needs
of others before our own, and puts into practice the most important and
overarching <i>mitzvot</i>, quoted by Yeshua in <u>Matthew 22:37b-40</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>'You are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your strength.' This is the greatest and most important
mitzvah. And a second is similar to it, 'You are to love your neighbor as
yourself.' All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on these two
mitzvot.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Loving our neighbor (including our loved ones) involves self-sacrifice.
Sometimes the sacrifice is miniscule and sometimes it is very great. However,
the willingness and even desire to do it is the very nature of God Himself.
The number of Scriptures I have found to cite is a testimony of how important
God considers hospitality.

This <i>Mitzvah</i> is not addressed by any of the classical commentators.
Components of it are addressed, however, such as having love for God and
eighbor, giving <i>tzedakah</i>, and otherwise walking in God's ways.
