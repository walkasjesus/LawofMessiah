looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. I asked, "Where
are you going?" He said to me, "To measure Yerushalayim, to determine its
width and length." Here the angel who was speaking to me went forward, and
another angel went out, met him and said to him, "Run and tell this young
man, &#039;Yerushalayim will be inhabited without walls, because there will
be so many people and animals; for," says ADONAI, "I will be for her a wall
of fire surrounding her; and I will be the glory within her. "Up!" says
ADONAI, "Move! Flee the land of the north! For I scattered you like the four
winds of the sky," says ADONAI. "Move, Tziyon! You who are living with the

<i>"In that case, I say, isn&#039;t it that they have stumbled with the result
that they have permanently fallen away?" Heaven forbid! Quite the contrary,
it is by means of their stumbling that the deliverance has come to the
Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy. Moreover, if their
stumbling is bringing riches to the world- that is, if Isra&#039;el&#039;s
being placed temporarily in a condition less favored than that of the
Gentiles is bringing riches to the latter- how much greater riches will
Isra&#039;el in its fullness bring them! However, to those of you who are
Gentiles I say this: since I myself am an emissary sent to the Gentiles, I
make known the importance of my work in the hope that somehow I may provoke
some of my own people to jealousy and save some of them! For if their
casting Yeshua aside means reconciliation for the world, what will their
accepting him mean? It will be life from the dead! Now if the hallah
offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole loaf. And if the root is
holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and
you - a wild olive - were grafted in among them and have become equal
sharers in the rich root of the olive tree, then don&#039;t boast as if you
were better than the branches! However, if you do boast, remember that you
are not supporting the root, the root is supporting you.</i>

it, but the fact is that they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have

It is a prevalent belief of today's Islamic Arabs that the land of Israel is
not God's (they say Allah's) appointed homeland for the Jewish people and
that the Nation of Israel (and presumably the Jews in it) should therefore be
blotted from existence. I have reprinted the following excerpts from an
English translation of the
<i>Qur&#039;an</i><sup><small><a name=fr1 href=#fn1>1</a></small></sup>

contrary to the Holy Scriptures (as we already know), but also to the words

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We see from the Scriptures presented that the people of Israel - the Jewish
People - are God's chosen people (He calls them sons) and therefore blessed
and protected by Him. His protection at any point in time is conditioned on
Israel's obedience to Him but, it transcends the times of their punishment,
and returns when Israel repents. But it is for God to judge and punish
Israel when He deems it needed, and not for anyone else. Even when God used
an enemy nation to punish Israel, he did so by using a nation that deserved
and was destined for punishment itself because it was already hostile to
Israel.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
To bring the matter more up to date, the Apostle Paul said in <u>Romans
11:7-8</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>What follows is that Isra'el has not attained the goal for which she is
striving. The ones chosen have obtained it, but the rest have been made
stonelike, just as the Tanakh says, 'God has given them a spirit of dullness
- eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, right down to the present
day.'</i>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
More and more, the Jewish people are having the scales of blindness fall
from their eyes and are receiving Yeshua, and it would therefore be well to
remember what Paul also said in <u>Romans 11:25-27</u>:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>For, brothers, I want you to understand this truth which God formerly
concealed but has now revealed, so that you won't imagine you know more than
you actually do. It is that stoniness, to a degree, has come upon Isra'el,
until the Gentile world enters in its fullness; and that it is in this way
that all Isra'el will be saved. As the Tanakh says, 'Out of Tziyon will come
the Redeemer; he will turn away ungodliness from Ya'akov and this will be my
covenant with them ... when I take away their sins.'</i>

In view of that and all else that has been presented, it would behoove both
individuals and nations to receive the blessing and not the cursing that is
promised for blessing and not cursing the Jewish people.
