<i>ADONAI, God, planted a garden toward the east, in &#039;Eden, and there he
put the person whom he had formed. Out of the ground ADONAI, God, caused to
grow every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food, including the tree
of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil ... ADONAI, God, took the person and put him in the garden of
&#039;Eden to cultivate and care for it. ADONAI, God, gave the person this
order: "You may freely eat from every tree in the garden except the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil. You are not to eat from it, because on the
day that you eat from it, it will become certain that you will die."</i>

<i>Now the serpent was more crafty than any wild animal which ADONAI, God, had
made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, &#039;You are not to eat
from any tree in the garden&#039;?" The woman answered the serpent, "We may
eat from the fruit of the trees of the garden, but about the fruit of the
tree in the middle of the garden God said, &#039;You are neither to eat from
it nor touch it, or you will die.&#039;" The serpent said to the woman, "It
is not true that you will surely die; because God knows that on the day you
eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil." When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it
had a pleasing appearance and that the tree was desirable for making one
wise, she took some of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband,
who was with her; and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened,
and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together to
make themselves loincloths.</i>

<i>In time, the day came when his master&#039;s wife took a look at Yosef and
said, "Sleep with me!" But he refused, saying to his master&#039;s wife,
"Look, because my master has me, he doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s going on
in this house. He has put all his possessions in my charge. In this house I
am his equal; he hasn&#039;t withheld anything from me except yourself,
because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin
against God?" But she kept pressing him, day after day. Nevertheless, he
didn&#039;t listen to her; he refused to sleep with her or even be with her.
However, one day, when he went into the house to do his work, and none of
the men living in the house was there indoors, she grabbed him by his robe
and said, "Sleep with me!" But he fled, leaving his robe in her hand, and
got himself outside.</i>

the highest point of the Temple. If you are the Son of God," he said,
"jump! For the Tanakh says, &#039;He will order his angels to be responsible
for you ... They will support you with their hands, so that you will not

Adversary took him up to the summit of a very high mountain, showed him all

<b><u>Commentary</u></b>
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
God's first commandment ever was His instruction to Adam and Eve to not eat
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve was tempted by the
serpent to eat of the tree and she did, and she tempted Adam, and he ate as
well. That is what is often referred to as the "original sin", and one of
its consequences is that mankind has been plagued by temptation to sin ever
since.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
We have lost our innocence of not knowing evil and there is no longer the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil to tempt us, but other temptations to
sin abound. That's the bad news. The good news is that God has given us
Yeshua, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the New Covenant which, together,
are more than adequate to keep us from falling into temptation and committing
sin. The two Scriptures that are most relevant are <u>1 Corinthians
10:13</u> and <u>James 4:7</u>. The first assures us that God will not allow
us to be tempted beyond our ability to cope, and that He will, in addition,
always provide a means of escape. The second Scripture assures us that Satan
cannot lodge within us, or continue to harass us, if we summon the power
given us by God and resist. Notice that neither Scripture calls us to
passivity. The first requires that we search for and employ the means of
escape provided for us, and the second requires that we actively resist the
sin of which we are tempted, by emphatically saying "no!" to it. If we do
those things we are promised victory, and even should we fail at times, <u>1
John 1:9</u> promises us:
