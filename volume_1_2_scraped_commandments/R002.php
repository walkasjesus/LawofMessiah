Today, the Holy Spirit is so identified with the New Covenant, that the
reality of the Spirit's ministry among men going back to creation is often
overlooked. Except for historical studies, the rabbinical community and much
of the Christian Church ignores the Holy Spirit, and relegates His work among
men to the distant past. In fact, none of the Covenants that God made with
men throughout the ages could have existed without the Holy Spirit, because
the Holy Spirit has always been the entity that allowed men to interact with
God the Father.

The order of the Scriptures presented in this <i>Mitzvah</i> shows the work
of the Holy Spirit at various stages of history, and it is striking how
similar and consistent His work has always been. He has always descended upon
men, lived within men, filled men, empowered men, gifted men, counseled and
led men and, enabled communication between men and God. The uniqueness of the
New Covenant in regard to the Holy Spirit is not the newness of His work, but
rather with whom He now interacts, and the intensity of the interaction.
Prior to the New Covenant, the Holy Spirit enabled all men to speak to God
(generally through prayer), but God was very particular about to whom He
spoke back. He conversed with Adam, Noah, the patriarchs, Moses, and others,
but they were always persons selected at His discretion. We call persons
prophets if it is their function to hear God, and to repeat what they hear to
others.

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
As marvelous as God's early form of interaction with men was, it was limited
because the ordinary Israelite did not have general access to the Holy
Spirit, and therefore had to consult with those that did have access, if he
wanted to receive God's guidance. It was like having a father whom you have
never met, and with whom you can only converse by way of a messenger.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
That limitation changed dramatically in the New Covenant, when God fulfilled
His promise through Joel to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh (<u>Joel 3:1
(2:28)</u>). Today, we are blessed to be able to relate to our heavenly
father in a direct and personal way, and to be able to have conversations
with Him, not only by our speaking to Him, but also by Him speaking back to
us. Through the New Covenant, we have gained a relationship with God that
most of us would not have had, had we lived prior to the time of Yeshua.
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
Now that brings me to Yeshua, of whom I have not yet spoken. Yeshua is a
critical part of the New Covenant, because His atoning sacrifice for us is
what enables us to be cleansed of sin so that the Holy Spirit can live within
us. Without Yeshua, we could not receive the Holy Spirit, and that is why
<u>Hebrews 9:13-15</u> says of Him, that He is the mediator of a New
Covenant:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>For if sprinkling ceremonially unclean persons with the blood of goats and
bulls and the ashes of a heifer restores their outward purity; then how much
more the blood of the Messiah, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered
himself to God as a sacrifice without blemish, will purify our conscience
from works that lead to death, so that we can serve the living God! It is
because of this death that he is mediator of a new covenant [or will].
Because a death has occurred which sets people free from the transgressions
committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive
the promised eternal inheritance.</i>

<font size=4 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
There are two ways that we can utilize the gifts of the Holy Spirit that have
been given to us in the New Covenant. We can use the gifts to enhance our
personal lives, and we can use them to enhance the lives of others. There are
a few among us who are specially gifted to equip others for ministry, and
these we sometimes call the "fivefold gift ministers", a term that refers to
the five ministries listed in <u>Ephesians 4:11-12</u>.

<i>Furthermore, he gave some people as emissaries, some as prophets, some as
proclaimers of the Good News, and some as shepherds and teachers. Their task
is to equip God&#039;s people for the work of service that builds the body of
the Messiah ...</i>

Among the gifts of the Spirit, tongues tends to be the most spoken about
because of confusion that has resulted from incorrect teaching. Three
incorrect things that I have most often heard taught about tongues are:
<ol>
<li> Speaking in tongues was a spiritual gift for the past only - not for
today (this is sometimes said about all of the gifts of the Spirit).
<br><br>
<li> Those who do not speak in tongues are not saved.
<br><br>
<li> Speaking in tongues is a sign that one has been filled with (baptized
in) the Holy Spirit, and those who do not speak in tongues have not been
filled.
</ol>

I hope and trust that my earlier reference to <u>1 Corinthians 12:28-30</u>
is sufficient to put the lie to #2 and #3 above:
</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
<font size=3 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
<i>And God has placed in the Messianic Community first, emissaries; second,
prophets; third, teachers; then those who work miracles; then those with
gifts of healing; those with ability to help; those skilled in
administration; and those who speak in various tongues. Not all are
emissaries, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? or teachers? or
miracle-workers? Not all have gifts of healing, not all speak in tongues,
not all interpret, do they?)</i>

As for #1 above, and other gifts of the Holy Spirit, suffice it to say that
the New Covenant, as we know it, could not exist without them.

Now just a bit more about the "immersion" or "baptism of the Holy Spirit".
First, the word "of" is incorrect, because it is not the Holy Spirit that
Immerses - it is Yeshua that immerses us in the Holy Spirit (<u>Matthew
3:11</u>, etc.). More importantly, several Christian denominations teach
that the "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" is a singular event of filling of
the Spirit - a second work of grace that necessarily comes after one is born
again. Both Scripture and life's experiences testify that immersion in the
Spirit need not be just a one-time occurrence (<u>Acts 9:22</u> and
<u>Ephesians 5:18-20</u>), and it need not be a distinguishable second event
after salvation because one can be filled with the Holy Spirit at the very
moment that one is "born again". Consider Cornelius the God-fearer and others
present when Peter preached the Good News of Yeshua in Cornelius' home:

Filling and refilling with the Holy Spirit can occur periodically throughout
one's life.
