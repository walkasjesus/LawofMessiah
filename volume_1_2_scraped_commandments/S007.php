<br>
<i>You are not to have sexual relations with any kind of animal and thus become
unclean with it; nor is any woman to present herself to an animal to have
sexual relations with it; it is perversion. Do not make yourselves unclean
by any of these things, because all the nations which I am expelling ahead
of you are defiled with them. The land has become unclean, and this is why
I am punishing it - the land itself will vomit out its inhabitants. But you
are to keep my laws and rulings and not engage in any of these disgusting
practices, neither the citizen nor the foreigner living with you; for the
people of the land have committed all these abominations, and the land is
now defiled. If you make the land unclean, it will vomit you out too, just
as it is vomiting out the nation that was there before you. For those who
engage in any of these disgusting practices, whoever they may be, will be
cut off from their people. So keep my charge not to follow any of these
abominable customs that others before you have followed and thus defile
yourselves by doing them. I am ADONAI your God.</i>

<i>For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women
exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the
men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one
another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in
themselves the penalty of their error which was due. And even as they did
not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased
mind, to do those things which are not fitting</i>

<i>Let us live properly, as people do in the daytime - not partying and getting
drunk, not engaging in sexual immorality and other excesses, not
quarrelling and being jealous. Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord
Yeshua the Messiah; and don&#039;t waste your time thinking about how to

<br>
<i>It is actually being reported that there is sexual sin among you, and it is
sexual sin of a kind that is condemned even by pagans - a man is living with
his stepmother! And you stay proud? Shouldn&#039;t you rather have felt
some sadness that would have led you to remove from your company the man who
has done this thing? For I myself, even though I am absent physically, am
with you spiritually; and I have already judged the man who has done this as
if I were present. In the name of the Lord Yeshua, when you are assembled,
with me present spiritually and the power of our Lord Yeshua among us, hand
over such a person to the Adversary for his old nature to be destroyed, so
that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord.</i>

<i>In my earlier letter I wrote you not to associate with people who engage in
sexual immorality. I didn&#039;t mean the sexually immoral people outside
your community, or the greedy, or the thieves or the idol-worshippers - for
then you would have to leave the world altogether! No, what I wrote you was
not to associate with anyone who is supposedly a brother but who also
engages in sexual immorality, is greedy, worships idols, is abusive, gets
drunk or steals. With such a person you shouldn&#039;t even eat! For what
business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Isn&#039;t it those who are part
of the community that you should be judging? God will judge those who are
outside. Just expel the evildoer from among yourselves.</i>

body, but the fornicator sins against his own body. Or don&#039;t you know
that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who lives inside you, whom
you received from God? The fact is, you don&#039;t belong to yourselves</i>
