meeting, so that you will not die. This is to be a permanent regulation
through all your generations, so that you will distinguish between the holy

<i>On Tuesday there was a wedding at Kanah in the Galil; and the mother of
Yeshua was there. Yeshua too was invited to the wedding, along with his
talmidim. The wine ran out, and Yeshua&#039;s mother said to him, "They
have no more wine." Yeshua replied, "Mother, why should that concern me? -
or you? My time hasn&#039;t come yet." His mother said to the servants, "Do
whatever he tells you." Now six stone water-jars were standing there for
the Jewish ceremonial washings, each with a capacity of twenty or thirty
gallons. Yeshua told them, "Fill the jars with water," and they filled them
to the brim. He said, "Now draw some out, and take it to the man in charge
of the banquet"; and they took it. The man in charge tasted the water; it
had now turned into wine! He did not know where it had come from, but the
servants who had drawn the water knew. So he called the bridegroom and said
to him, "Everyone else serves the good wine first and the poorer wine after
people have drunk freely. But you have kept the good wine until now!" This,
the first of Yeshua&#039;s miraculous signs, he did at Kanah in the Galil;
he manifested his glory, and his talmidim came to trust in him.</i>

The above Scriptures speak for themselves. Drunkenness is prohibited;
drinking wine in moderation is not. Wine is used in various ways within
Messianic Judaism - as one of the elements in the <i>Shulchan Adonai</i> (the
Lord's Table), for <i>Kiddush</i>, for <i>Havdalah</i>, and as a celebratory
beverage.

Of the numerous Scriptures that command against becoming intoxicated through
drinking, Maimonides and HaChinuch quote only <u>Leviticus 10:8-11</u> that
prohibits priests from entering the Temple after drinking wine or other
intoxicating liquor. Meir does not address the subject at all.
